            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo sighed as he walked to school. He had woken up late again today and was walking alone because of it. He had just told Keigo and Mizuiro to go on ahead of him. He wasn't in the mood to listen to Keigo's whining or deal with his hyper antics this morning anyway. Staying up almost all night stamping out a nest of annoyingly persistent Hollows did that to a guy. Lately it seemed like the Hollows had been growing more aggressive, attacking in greater numbers, and all around just making a bigger nuisance of themselves than normal. Ichigo was no weakling so it wasn't like he was having trouble...but if he had many more nights like this he might end up making a stupid mistake or his family may find him out and wandering around. He rubbed his head irritably. It would all just be way too much trouble. He had enough things to worry about just trying to live his life as a semi-normal teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a big yawn as he passed by an abandoned lot, his senses suddenly twinging. Aw crap...not again. He tossed his bag into a nearby bush and pressed his badge to his chest. Instantly his soul separated from his body, the Hollow materializing in front of him. Ichigo smirked a little. He was lucky today! Before the Hollow could so much as move he slashed his blade right down the center of the mask, killing the creature instantly. Ichigo sheathed his sword and went back to his body. Killing these low level Hollows wasn't even a challenge anymore. Just an annoyance. He fished his bag out of the bush and his hand brushed up against something. He blinked a little and pulled the object out of the bush. It was...some kind of...bottle? It was full of a bright yellow mixture. He opened it up and smelled it. Huh...lemony. Nice. He normally didn't drink strange things he found laying in bushes but his tiredness was affecting his judgment and he decided it wouldn't be TOO harmful to have a few gulps of lemonade. He took a few hearty gulps, draining about half the bottle before he stopped. He sighed and wiped his mouth, closing the bottle up and putting it into his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to walk to school he felt...more energized somehow. His body didn't feel as tired and his mind wasn't as cloudy. Well, maybe today wouldn't be too bad after all. He rolled his shoulder a little as he walked. His clothes felt a little...tight for some reason...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Ichigo walked to school, he hadn't noticed that he had began to slowly grow. He was becoming a little annoyed. Why the hell were his clothes so tight!? With that thought, he reached the school doors. Ichigo moaned as he felt his toes clenching A LOT in his shoes. Ichigo stepped in through the door and there was a dull popping sound. Surprised, he looked down and saw his laces had popped open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird, these shoes were new...\" He sat down and irritably threw his bag to the gorund. This wasn't his day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone groaned and sat down, some students already going into a daze. But, Ichigo was dilligently listening and taking notes, right up until his pencil suddenly broke in half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rummaged through his bag to pull out another one, leaning over. A low ripping sound suddenly filled the classroom as Ichigo's shirt ripped slightly, from the bottom of the hem about halfway up his back. This shocked Ichigo, making him look his body over. As he sat there, he stared at his feet. His toes had burst through the front of his sneakers! He wiggled his socked toes, and realized that his pants were reaching a few inches above his ankles! His shirt was filled up with his body, the buttons straining on his shirt. The bottom of the shirt was lifted up, showing off the bottom row of his abs. He lifted his arm up and sighed as he saw the sleeves were all ripped up too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on!?\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo realized that a few people had whispering about him. He blsuhed, hoping that this wouldn't continue. He took his tattered shoes off, leaving him in a very tight pair of socks, and he stared, noticing how big his massive, sexy feet were. His powerful big toes had already puched a whole through his socks! This was crazy!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo thought briefly of rushing out of the classroom and hiding in the bathroom or trying to leave the school but he decided that would just cause too much of a ruckus. Only a few people were giving him looks. If he just waited this out, he would eventually stop growing, could wait for everyone to leave, and then escape himself, back home or...to somewhere else. He had no idea WHY he was growing but it couldn't keep happening...could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo slapped himself a little. Of course it would! This whole situation was crazy! Things like this didn't just happen! His attention was suddenly brought back down to his feet as he felt something cold on them. His growth, still moving, had caused his feet to burst out of his socks like they were a rotten shell, only a few scraps still hanging desperately to his thickening ankles. The coldness was from his huge soles pressing against the cold floor. Now the remains of his shoes and socks were littered on the floor. His knees pressed desperately into the bottom of his desk, effectively pinning him in place. He winced. Well now, if he wanted to leave he physically couldn't! He was in this room for the long haul...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mizuiro...\" Keigo whispered to his friend in the the seat in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Mizuiro responded, one headphone still in, only half focusing on the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it JUST me or is Ichigo like...huge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizuiro looked over at Ichigo, whose shirt was now ripped open in the front, the buttons scattered over his desk top, his pants ripped apart at the bottom, looking more like shorts, his huge arms nearly touching the ground as they hung at his sides, his muscles bulging. Ichigo winced as the tiny desk dug into his waist, his swelling package practically getting crushed under his desk, the chair groaning while a bolt snapped on his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No, he doesn't.\" Mizuiro said, mostly to spite Keigo but also because he had NO idea what was happening to Ichigo and he didn't really want to get involved with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!? You've got to be kidding me!\" Keigo shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asano!\" the teacher suddenly shouted. \"Stop making a ruckus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But! But! But!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But nothing! Now be quiet unless you want a detention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeigo slumped in defeat against his desk, sobbing a little at his humiliating defeat. \"No one ever believes me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo, meanwhile, was now firmly wedged into his desk. The boy sitting behind him was basically staring bug eyed at Ichigo's wide, powerful back, his massive arms and broad shoulders nearly nudging the people next to him, his feet already situated next to the desk of the girl in front of him, the huge toes dwarfing her whole foot! Ichigo winced again, panting slightly. His groin was REALLY starting to hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, or not...the desk could no longer take his weight and was crushed under his incredible weight, the desk top crashing onto his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichigo!\" the teacher said, not turning from the blackboard as she wrote something down. \"Stop making a ruckus or you'll join Keigo in detention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry!\" Ichigo said, his voice sounding deeper and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you don't need to shout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo just sighed and then winced once more as his head smashed into the ceiling. \"Oh just great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that the class became aware of Ichigo. There was nothing but a stunned silence...and then...</span></div></div>",

As this happened, teachers from other classrooms began to peep into the class to see what was wrong. They got freaked out and ran, forcing their classes to be dismissed as well. Even Ichigo's teacher had evacuated. Ichigo just managed to peek out the window, seeing that everyone was outside the school, as if this was some kind of fire drill. The only people in the whole school was Ichigo and Keigo, who was just staring up at Ichigo in fear and amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Ichigo? Are you okay?\" He managed to choke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Ichigo said, rubbing his head, crouching down a little. \"Geez, what was that all about...?\" He groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Ichigo...\" Keigo began, calming down a little. \"You are kinda big...\" He said, looking over Ichigo.

His arms erupted out to either side, his biceps swelling, the veins thickening. His forearms and hands followed, increasing rapidly in mass. His chest grew, until his pecs were nearly pressed up against his chin, pushing out of his chest, revealing all of their glory. His abs were next, each row rising, each one as hard as rock. His elbows pressed against the two walls he was in between, his back warping the wall behind him, and part of the ceiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! This isn't good..\" Ichigo yelled, making Keigo jump. \"I think it would be a good idea if you left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But... I-Ichigo...\" He said, studdering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave! NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeigo ran at full speed, scared to death by Ichigo's booming voice. Ichigo attempted to lean his lower back against the wall behind him, and succeeded, but his huge, strong feet burst through the wall at the front of the class, leading into the next classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Ichigo yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, now that he had more room to grow, he wasn't as uncomfortable. He wiggled his big, massive toes, and then flexed them, trying to get the falling debris off of his foot. Thank God he had his first class on the first floor today, or else his giant, growing, hot body would have fallen through the floor already! Ichigo watched as he still grew, his massive buldge slightly blocking his vision of whatever was in front of him. He estimated that he was about... forty feet tall at this point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His bulging frame continued to expand and swell, limiting the room he had left. But a sharp pain brought his attention to his now massive bulging breifs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's monster cock was fighting to break free from its cloth prison, and he could felt the straining fabric digging into his massive tool. Slowly it swelled bigger and bigger, faint tearing sounds coming from the straining fabric. Already Ichigo could see the base of his massive shaft, along with the fuzzy orange pubic hair. Ichigo was in a mix of pain and pleasure. His boxers was getting more painful by the minute in trying to contain his massive package, but the sight and feel of his massive cock growing more and more, stretching the boxers to their limits and filling the room with his manhood was exciting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Ichigo started getting hard, filling his boxers with even more hot teen cock. The boxers had reached their breaking point, at that point Ichigo felt a brief pain along with a wave of relief as his boxers burst open and his colossal cock surged through. His cock burst through the next classroom, smashing the wall to rubble. Ichigo lay there in relief, finally having his massive cock free from the prison of his boxers. But the feeling did not last since he realised he was still getting harder by the minute. He stared at his cock and watched as it swelled more and more with size, rising higher and higher. He could feel the skin begining to tighten on it as it neared the ceiling of the other room. A moan escaped his lips as he felt it smash through the ceiling of the other room, no reaching its full mast. He lay there awestruck, as big as his body was his cock was pretty massive, more than half the lenght of his legs and just as thick. He blushed though at the though of everyone seeing his now massive manhood, good thing everyone had cleared from the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now he was in an awkward position. His massive, bulging muscles had him pinned in one room, while his massive cock was stuck in about two other rooms. \"Well\", he thought \"as long as I'm stuck I might as well....\"</span></div></div>",

Ichigo rubbed his abs absentmindedly and muttered, \"Right, I came back here for lunch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeigo was starting to sweat just a little bit. It wasn't bad enough that Ichigo was suddenly a freakishly huge muscle bound giant, capable of tearing desks apart with his crotch, but now he was hungry? What exactly would he want to eat? Keigo suddenly went pale and ran forward, jumping up and hugging Ichigo as best he could around the midsection. \"Oh please don't eat me Ichigo! I don't taste goooooood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you shut up?!\" Ichigo shouted, peeling Keigo off his body with one hand, holding him in front of his face, grabbing the back of his collar. \"I may be bigger but you're still too big for me to eat! Now, could you PLEASE make yourself useful and find some food for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeigo gulped and nodded. \"S-Sure thing Ichigo! You can count on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's stomach rumbled ominously again and the massive teen tossed Keigo towards the door. \"I'd better be able to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeigo crashed through the door and slid slightly across the floor, whimpering as he smashed into the wall. \"Ouch....why does everyone mistreat me like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got to his feet and started running towards the kitchens. There would no doubt be plenty of food in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Keigo ran off to get food, Ichigo sighed and looked around the classroom. Things were looking pretty grim. He was huge, possibly still growing, and trapped inside this classroom. At least everyone in the school had evacuated so he didn't have to worry about hurting anyone. He easily shoved some desks aside and laid down, staring up at the ceiling. What in the world could have caused this all to happen? He closed his eyes and thought about it. He had woken up...fought a Hollow...found a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly sat up, his eyes wide open. Of course! That yellow...stuff! He grabbed his now tiny bag and searched through it. He pulled out the half empty bottle full of yellow liquid and glared at it. THIS was the stuff that had done this! He wasn't sure HOW exactly a beverage had caused him to start growing but it was the only explanation he had! He was tempted to smash the damn thing but knew he would need it if he was going to get back to normal size. Urahara would probably be able to tell him more about it. For now, he'd just have to wait until a better opportunity presented itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the bottle back into his bag as Keigo skidded back into the room, his arms full of various food items. \"Here you go Ichigo! I raided the kitchens and grabbed as much as I could!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo easily pulled the food out of Keigo's arms and just began to chow down. Meat, rice, fruit, vegetables, cooked or uncooked it didn't matter. Ichigo was able to swallow most of it whole anyway. He just needed something to satiate the raging hunger inside him. When all the food was resting in Ichigo's belly he glared at Keigo and said, \"What made you think that would be enough? Get more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was always a little short with Keigo but his anger at the situation, mixed with his hunger, was making Ichigo even more unreasonable than usual. Keigo jumped like he had been stung and ran out of the room, to get more food from the kitchens. Ichigo rubbed his forehead lightly. This whole thing was giving him a major headache.</span></div></div>",

Everyone could plainly see that Ichigo was massive, and still growing! The girl in front of him was unlucky, or in others' opinions, very lucky when she turned around, her face a few inches away from Ichigo's massive buldge! His massive, strong feet had already passed by her desk a little while ago as his feet, and legs had continued to grow longer and wider. She was right in between his beautifuly shaped, huge legs! She turned her head back towards the front, staring at the massive feet that were a small distance away from her, Ichigo's toes flexing and wiggling as they continued pushing forward. His feet were almost a foot longer than the height of the desk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think I should... I'm fine!\" Ichigo said, his voice booming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, stop causing such a ruckus!\" She yelled, still writing something onto the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes M'am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that he couldn't leave if he wanted to at this point! And, if he tried to, it wouldn't be pretty! His body continued to swell larger, his buldge bumping the head of the girl in front of her. She pushed her desk upward, scared, but aroused. Ichigo let out a low moan as his upper back now pushed against the roof, putting him in an uncomfortable position, his huge feet moving closer and closer to the front desk. His massive, well defined thighs were pulsating with muscle, while his calves jutted out more. His pecs pushed out further and further, his eight pack becoming rock hard, his biseps and triceps also swelling. Ichigo looked at his behemoth sized feet, and sighed. What was he going to do!?</span></div></div>",

Everyone quieted down as they heard this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the floor collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could know what was happening they were plummeting down into the lower classroom. Now, this was lucky for one single reason: the lower classroom was one of the unused ones, meaning Ichigo didn't smash a class full of students under his immense and still expanding bulk. The bad news was...well the floor collapsed, what else do I have to say? Ichigo fell first, the floor buckling completely, sending him smashing onto the floor below, which luckily managed to hold his current weight, though the floor was bending alarmingly and obviously wouldn't support him for much longer. About half the students fell down with him, one landing on his shoulder, another on his foot, a few on his chest, a handful on his legs, and finally, the girl in front of him landed smack dab, face first in his crotch. The manly scent exuding from it sent her reeling to the ground in a dead faint, her face blushing, her expression blissful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's face was burning red at all of this. He shakily began to move students off his body, trying to set them down in places where they wouldn't be trapped or easily hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Sorry everyone! This isn't my fault!\" Ichigo tried to explain, looking around at everyone who either just stared back at him in awe or ran screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the other half of the class that hadn't fallen through the floor, they were desperately still standing on pieces of the floor that hadn't fallen down, wedging themselves in the window frames, or dangling off of pipes and cords. The teacher was crouching against the blackboard, her legs bent, on a tiny piece of the floor in front of her. She slowly began moving towards the door to get out of here and start warning the school! Ichigo looked up and carefully grabbed the few dangling students, setting them down on the ground. He looked up again and held up his hands. \"Anyone who wants out, get over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students jumped into Ichigo's hands one by one. He had to make multiple trips to ferry all the students to safety, but soon he was sitting in the two destroyed classrooms alone, his legs crossed, his knees pressing against opposite walls while his head was halfway up into his classroom again already, his arms crossed, the elbows pushing into the same walls as his knees. \"Not good...\" he muttered, feeling the floor sag down again.</span></div></div>",

Out of no where, his body began to grow even faster than it just was, his knees and elbows pressing more and more against the walls, soon cracking and crumbling as they couldn't take the pressure. Ichigo then felt his head hit his homeroom class' ceiling once again and he shouted out in pain, putting his massive, hot feet in front of him as they burst through the wall, portraying them for everyone as they stood in the front yard of the school. Kid's shouted as they watched a pair of massive arms also burst out of the school walls, and Ichigo's head soon followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the school crumbled on top of Ichigo, hiding his massive manhood from the sight of everyone around him. A few girls shrieked, his huge, muscular feet a few feet away from them, standing a few feet taller than them!

He then retracted the tongue back into his mouth, the people stuck to it being tasted and then swallowed down into his abs to be food for his muscles. He repeated this, until the only one left were the ones hanging on the seats. <br>\r\nTo get them ichigo started sucking, causing the passengers to lose there grip and be sucked into his mouth, like a noodle being slurped in. After getting their taste, he swallows, his muscles easily bringing the food into his stomach.<br>\r\n\"Shit that tasted good\" Ichigo said licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock throbbing and leaking precum to the people below. Globs of clear pre crushing the crowd. <br>\r\n\"Hehe, this going to be good\" Said Ichigo, his cock throbbing in anticipation.<br>\r\nHe then lowered one of the coaches to his cock. Putting them side by side, his cock was bigger then the coach. The people inside could see the veiny monster outside. Thick veins bulging out of the side of the shaft.<br>\r\nHe then raised the coach so that the tip was touching the end.<br>\r\n\"READY OR NOT HERE I CUM!!!\"Shouted Ichigo.<br>\r\nHe then thrusted his cock into the coach, his shaft penetrating the metal and impaling it. The coach hugging his shaft nicely. The people inside were either crushed or injured. Their bodies pushed against the sweaty and hot cock. Those at the end of the were the most unlucky, those who were still alive were face to faced with the oozing head. Others were crushed instantly by the force of the impact, turning into pulp instantly. Their blood turning into lube for the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people then saw the cock retract, believing that the giant stop, they breathed a sigh of relief, that however was crushed as the cock was thrust back in. In and out, in and out. The people inside were reduced to a pulp. Their bodies being used to quicken Ichigo's pleasure. Ichigo just kept thrusting the coach in and out, until the coach broke. removing the metal from his cock, ichigo saw his cock had red streaks. He then reached for the last coach. Repeating the same thing, he thrust his cock inside and proceeded to turn the passengers into lube for his cock. Ichigo's hand quickening his pumps. In a state of lust Ichigo removed the coach and grabbed a bunch of people. He lowered them to his cock and gripped it. The people being crushed against the hot shaft. He then started to rub up and down their wriggling bodies heightening the pleasure. Squeezing his hand and turning them to lube. He just kept grabbing more people when the previous one was no more. He even grabbed a bus and teared it open to suck out the passengers. While licking the inside of the bus, ichigo started to feel he was about to cum. Grabbing another set of people, he started rubbing even faster, turning the fragile bodies into pulp instantly.<br>\r\n\"GONNA CUM!!!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\nWhite Gold came out and showered the people. Some were crushed instantly, while others suffocated in the white globs and others were scalded by the hot liquid. Ichigo panting grabbed a crowd of people and started to use them to clean the cum of his body, running them over his biceps, scrubbing in between his meaty pecs, putting them between his abs, scrubbing his feet, in between his toes and finally his cock, rubbing his shaft and cupping his balls. The sweat dripping onto his hand and coating the people, people being rubbed all over each ball. Some people were caught in his wrinkly skin and being stranded on his balls. Ichigo then brought them to his face and used his tongue to lick the crowd. Then he clasped his hand into his mouth, the crowd being thrusted into his mouth. Savoring the flavor of meat,sweat and cum. Being swished around each cheek, showing a bulge to the people outside. Then he swallowed, his adam's apple bobbing up and down, bringing the huge lump filled with people and saliva into his stomach, to become fuel for his muscles.<br>\r\n\" Ah shit that was the best jack off ever! I feel so full\" Said ichigo rubbing his abs and giving out a loud belch.<br>\r\nIchigo then...</span></div></div>",

The last thing that they saw was the wide sole of ichigo's foot before turning into a stain on the giant's foot. Ichigo walked through the city a bit, toppling over buildings and crushing anything in his way. He would occasionally pick up a group of people and shove them in his mouth. Ichigo toyed with the people inside his mouth, slapping them with his tongue before swallowing them.<br>\r\n\"I just thought of the best idea.\" said ichigo.<br>\r\nHe then sat down, cushing many people with his muscular ass. Most people were crushed by the two cheeks while others survived but were stuck in between his cheeks. Ichigo then farted on the people making it extremely unbearable for the people down there. He then reached down towards his ass and poked the people inside his asswhole. They would wriggle around in there but would eventually succumb to the same fate as rengi, being crushed by the walls of his anus. Ichigo loved the feeling of the tiny people wriggling around in him. This made him erect and wanting to release but ichigo was saving it for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is going to be so fun.\"<br>\r\nIchigo grabbed the crowds surrounding him and put them all on his stomach. He then picked them all up at once and brought them to his face. They were right at his mouth. They could see drool coming out from the sides of his mouth. Ichigo then poked out his tongue and licked the people, coating them in his saliva. Some got stuck to the tongue and were pulled back into his mouth to be swallowed. The remaining people were now all wet and scared fro their lives. Ichigo then lowered the crowd down and placed them at the base of his cock.<br>\r\n\"You bugs are gonna enjoy this.\"<br>\r\nIchigo then plucked a young boy from the crowd and brought them to the tip of his cock. Hey was staring into ichigo's slit as it widened. The boy could smell the overpowering manly musk emanating from ichigo's cock, as well as everyone else. Ichigo then lowered the boy to his slit and shoved his feet in. This send waves of pleasure throughout ichigo's body. The boy stared up at ichigo while stuck in his body. Every second he was getting pulled in deeper. Ichigo quickened the boy's decent as he pushed the rest of the boy into his cock. The boy travelled down ichigo's shaft, smacking the walls coated in old piss and cum. The boy eventually splashed down into one of ichigo's nuts. He was instantly coated in the thick cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT WAS INCREDIBLE!!\"<br>\r\nIchigo then grabbed more people to shove into his cock. He would shove some in head first and watch their legs kick wildly. Person after person was devoured by ichigo's cock. They slapped the walls of his shaft and landed in the musky chambers that were ichigo's nuts. Ichigo continued until nobody was left on his cock. They were all wriggling in his sack, sending waves of pleasure through the giant. Ichigo started to fondle his balls, feeling all the people wriggling inside of him as he shook his junk. Ichigo was feeling so powerful, unstoppable.<br>\r\n\"I NEED TO CUM!!\"<br>\r\nIchigo then got up and started walking around the city, grabbing crowds of people to masturbate with. They would be pressed against his hard dick and then be turned into paste by ichigo's powerful movement. The people were nothing but a sex toy for ichigo now. He continued to grab crowd after crowd to turn into lube for his pleasure. Ichigo made his way to a huge building right before he was about to blow.<br>\r\n\"GET READY, HAHA!!\"<br>\r\n\"The people in his balls rose with his cum and were launched through his shaft, onto the building. Ichigo fired blast after blast into the building, eventually making it collapse. Ichigo continued to fire his cum everywhere. After ichigo was done his surroundings were nothing but destroyed buildings coated in cum that had people inside, either dead or alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now this was the best jack off ever.\"<br>\r\nIchigo then went to the cum globbed and licked them up, enjoying the taste of his cum and the delicious people inside. Ichigo noticed there was some cum with people in it on him, a lot of it. Ichigo then grabbed all the globes on his body and rubbed them under his armpit and balls. He wanted to get the taste of his sweat as well. After rubbing he plopped the sweating cum soaked people inside his mouth and swallowed them. <br>\r\n\"Now what to do.\" </span></div></div>",

He WAS feeling a little sick, so maybe he shouldn't go to school. Ichigo snickered as he turned away from the path leading to school, and began walking home. He could use this as a chance to relax, and finally have some time to himself! Karin and Yuzu were at school, and his dad said that he was going to be at the market for most of the day, so... he would be able to do what he wanted to do without any interuptions!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as he walked, Ichigo was completely unaware that he was ever-so slowly growing larger. It wasn't quite noticeable at the moment, but it was indeed happening. Ichigo's wrist's were now being revealed, his sleeve no longer blocking them. Most of his muscles were seeable through the straining fabric of his uniform, and in a few places, small holes were forming. His feet were crammed into his now too small shoes, his toes bending at the front. The great tightness around Ichigo's body was becoming more than a nusance, though he knew he would have to wait until he got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn uniform,\" Ichigo muttered, \"It's WAY too tight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued walking, he finally arrived at home.

He sighed as something soft and plushy collided with his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that! And that! And THAT!\" Kon shouted, the plushy lion beating his fists against Ichigo's head, shoving his fist into his mouth, and pulling on his nose. Ichigo growled in pure annoyance and ripped him off his face, clenching his throat in his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing you little pest?!?\" Ichigo shouted, launching Kon across the room, slamming him into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKon instantly popped up and shouted, \"Don't play dumb! You got rid of all my magazines! All those lovely girls...how could you?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo slammed his door and shouted back, \"You idiot! I don't want you using my body to buy trash like that! You're lucky I didn't rip your stuffing out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKon pretended to cry as he covered his eyes and said, \"You're so mean to me Ichigo! I don't ask for much! Just a few simple photos of a few simple ladies to keep me company in my times of need! Rukia isn't here anymore to cuddle so what do you expect me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suck it up and stop being a pervert!\" Ichigo said, cracking his neck as he made his way over to the bed. \"If you buy those magazines again I'm going to give you to Yuzu and make sure you STAY with Yuzu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKon glared at Ichigo and said, \"You wouldn't! You wouldn't dare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo grabbed Kon and gave him an evil smile. \"Just try me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKon waved his arms about and shouted, \"You're just a bully! A great big bully!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo let Kon fall to the ground and stomped on him for good measure, grinding him into the ground, shoving his toes in the lion's mouth. Kon sputtered and struggled while Ichigo just laughed. \"A bully huh? Well, what are you going to do about it dust rag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKon gave Ichigo the middle finger as this kept up. Ichigo just chuckled and kicked Kon aside, laying down on the bed as he did so. He felt much better after that, but was still queasy. It didn't help that his clothes felt even TIGHTER for some reason. Not to mention that his bed seemed to be sagging down more than it used to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ichigo closed his eyes and wondered what the heck was going on in his body, Kon was sitting up and rubbing his sore jaw. Ichigo had stomped on him and shoved his toes in his mouth before, along with his fingers and other objects but today it had felt much different. Ichigo hadn't been any rougher, yet he still felt more sore than usual. It was like his toes filled his mouth more or something. Kon looked over at Ichigo and was shocked by what he saw. The shirt that Ichigo was wearing was pulled tight against his body, the sleeves ripping apart as his arms appeared to be growing bigger and longer! His shirt was rising up, showing off his abs while his chest pushed against the buttons of the shirt, stretching them to the breaking point, ovals of flesh visible all down his torso. His pants were fairing no better, the legs hiked up above his calves, while his thighs were bursting through the material. Kon didn't linger too long on Ichigo's swelling bulge, which was straining the button on his pants, the waistband cutting into his waist, before looking at Ichigo's feet which were pushing off the end of the bed, each foot looking even bigger than Kon was used to, each toe thick and powerful looking, flexing lightly as Ichigo relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey Ichigo! What the heck is happening to you?!?\" Kon shouted in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What are you...what the hell?!?\" Ichigo sat up as he looked over his body, still growing, ripping his clothes left and right. As he watched the buttons finally gave up and popped off one by one, ricocheting around his room and smacking Kon in the face. As he rubbed his nose, Ichigo got to his feet and smacked his head against the ceiling. \"Ouch! Dammit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent over slightly, the seat of his pants ripping open while his tights popped open the material of his pants, showing off his thickening muscles. Kon ran over against the farthest wall from Ichigo and just watched as the boy continued to swell up, bigger and bigger.</span></div></div>",

Carma's a bitch, isn't it? This is what you get for getting rid of all my magazines!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut-The Hell-UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo was crouching over quite a bit now, and his ceiling was about eight feet high, so he asumed that he was nearing ten feet at this point. His pecs had become a sight for sore eyes, pushing out more, while his six- pack showed signs of it soon becoming an eight pack. His thighs and calves slowly grew longer, wider and more defined, while his big feet moved across the floor as they grew bigger. Kon couldn't help but stare at Ichigo's buldge because of how noticeable it was, since it was straining his boxers to the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk... I'll have to go get it,\" Ichigo muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small stuffed animal smirked, walking towards Ichigo. \"Then get your lazy ass MOVING! I can't wait to see-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKon was interupted as Ichigo stepped on him, his massive bare foot covering his whole miniscual body, though his tale could still be seen. \"Screw you! I already have enough problems without you bitching and laughing at me ALL the time!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo peeled Kon off his foot, and walked to his room door. \"You're... a mea...nie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could crawl through the door, but his body was still too wide to fit through it! He got on his hands and knees, and tried pushing through the door. The sides of the door frame were literally being ripped off as he pushed, and part of the walls beside him were also now crumbling at the sides. When he fianlly got through, he continued to crawl through the small hall and soon went down the stairs. As he reached the living room, he stood up, and was releaved that he didn't have to bend down that much anymore as the ceiling was higher, at ten feet. He still had to crouch, so he asumed he was about a foot taller than that. Ichigo swore to himself as the knocking continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm COMING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe than ducked A LOT so however it was would be able to see his face. He ripped the door off it's hinges by accident, and through it to the side of the room. Ichigo realized that the person, now terrified of his massive growing body, was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ichigo, his huge body still growing larger, was crouched down, his hand resting on the top of the door frame while his clothes were slowly shredding off his body, his shirt now a distant memory, showing off his massive upper body, swelling pecs, bulging biceps and a cobblestone road of abs, leading down to his huge bulge, the brief clad mound peeking out from the destroyed button and forced down zipper. Renji blushed slightly at the bulge before quickly averting his gaze and looking further down, the pants barely qualifying as shorts, while Ichigo's huge feet, bigger than a pair of sleds, were slowly approaching Renji's own shoe clad feet, the enormous toes clenching, constantly rearranging themselves as they consistently moved across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Ichigo? What the hell happened to you?\" Renji shouted, gazing up at Ichigo's face as the substitute Soul Reaper's back started pressing up against the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get in here!\" Ichigo snapped. Before Renji could move, Ichigo's meaty fist grabbed the front of his shirt and dragged him forcibly, effortlessly inside. Ichigo slammed the kitchen table against the naked door frame, the wooden structure serving as a makeshift door while Ichigo fell onto his ass, shaking the house, his head already making progress towards the ceiling. Ichigo glared down at Renji and said, \"What are you doing here anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji crossed his arms and said, \"There have been a larger gathering of Hollows around here than are normal so they sent me here to investigate. I thought coming here would be as good a place as any to start. Now enough about that! Why are you so freaking huge? And why are you still growing?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo sighed, his gigantic chest heaving, and said, \"I have no idea! I just started feeling sick and then came home and started growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be! That's just not possible! You must have done, seen, or experienced SOMETHING to start changing like this!\" Renji argued. \"Think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo closed his eyes, his head now pressing up against the ceiling, cracks radiating out from the point his head was pressing against. Ichigo scooted forward a little, his bulge nearly colliding with Renji who just barely managed to move out of the way in time. Ichigo was now laying on his elbows, his legs spread eagle on either side of Renji. Renji avoided looking at the massive offering of man meat in front of him, barely decently covered by underwear, while Ichigo thought. \"I walked to school...fought a Hollow...felt sick....no wait...there was something before that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped his fingers as he said, \"Got it! That yellow stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What yellow stuff?\" Renji said, looking up at Ichigo's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo pointed at his backpack, still laying on the couch. \"In there! In a bottle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji climbed over Ichigo's thick leg and opened the bag, rifling through it. Ichigo growled in frustration as his head pressed up against the ceiling yet again. He laid flat on his back, his feet starting to press against the walls, his thick hair trailing up the stairs while his arms stretched out to either side of him, one hand brushing up against the kitchen cabinets while the other knocked over the T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the stuff?\" Renji asked, holding up the yellow bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I drank that stuff and then started feeling sick! That must be what caused this!\" Ichigo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji looked at the bottle. So...this stuff had made Ichigo grow...He stole a glance at Ichigo's body. Big...buff...tremendously powerful...and it could all be Renji's. This might just be the break he was looking for! A way to get much more powerful, strong enough to make any Soul Reaper or Hollow tremble in fear of him. All he had to do was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renji! What are you doing?!?\" Ichigo shouted angrily, trying to grab Renji as he started gulping down the contents of the bottle. Renji jumped out of the way, not spilling a drop, and kept on drinking. When it was empty, he tossed the bottle aside and wiped his mouth, grinning at the pissed off looking Ichigo. \"What the hell was that?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji laughed and said, \"There's no way I'm letting an opportunity like this slip by! You shouldn't be complaining about a gift like this either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gift? I don't want to be some giant freak!\" Ichigo shouted. \"I get enough bad attention as it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, pipe down! Just enjoy the ride!\" Renji scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ichigo could say anything else, Renji bent over slightly, holding his stomach. \"Augh...here it comes!\"</span></div></div>",

Renji reached the city. <br>\r\nPeople could feel the vibrations being caused by Renji's footfalls.<br>\r\n\"wha-what the hell is THAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe onlookers saw Renji covered in sweat, his muscles bulging with power, his feet covered with blood.<br>\r\nPeople could smell the manly musk coming from Renji's body. The aroma making men and women alike horny.<br>\r\nRenji too was horny his erection could not be hidden. His penis looked like a living fleshy mountain that was covered in veins.<br>\r\nSuddenly his stomach growled loudly, sending a shiver down the spines of the people below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhats Renji gonna do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Making them pause and regret that they ever did because the next thing they saw was the big sweaty sole of Renji's foot before being crushed under it, making them fall down and feel the pressure of Renji's foot before being popped like a bubble under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji then spotted a large crowd in the panic that was heading towards a dead end.<br>\r\nHe started chasing after them, giving people near and where his feet landed no chance to escape.<br>\r\nHe finally cornered them and said. \"No escape no bugs, your gonna be in here next\" pointing to his muscular abs.<br>\r\nSuddenly Renji grabbed the crowd in his hands easily keeping them in his cupped hands. Careful not to crush his precious food supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up again and started walking to the park not caring on what or who he steps on.<br>\r\nOn the way he grabbed more people careful not to crush the people he was handling.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes he arrived and sat down, spreading his legs wide and creating a closed space for the people to be kept.<br>\r\nhe then proceeded to drop the people he was holding between his legs.<br>\r\nThey could hear the loud rumbles of Renji's stomach and they could smell the sweaty stench of Renji's body.<br>\r\n\"So, BUGS! Who wants to be first to be made into energy for your massive muscular god.\" said Renji while flexing his biceps and bouncing his bulging pecs, showing of his manliness.<br>\r\n\"Any volunteers?' Renji asked with a provocative tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd looked uneasy, no one was racing there hand, mostly because they  were scared of how big Renji is and how they were all probably going to get eaten.<br>\r\nThen suddenly to the surprise of the crown and even Renji himself, a boy who looked like in his late teens raised his hands and volunteered.<br>\r\n\"Sir Renji Sir, Please pick me\" He said outloud<br>\r\n\"Ohoo, we got a brave one here\" Renji said.<br>\r\nHe then grabbed the boy from the crowd ans brought him to his face.<br>\r\n\"What's your name kid?\" Renji asked<br>\r\n\"It's Akira, Master Renji\" He said with respect<br>\r\n\"Well Akira why'd you volunteer aren't you afraid to die alone in my stomach\" Renji asked with curiosity.<br>\r\n\"Well, Master I actually see you time to time with your orange haired friend, you even saved me once from a hollow\" said the boy meekly<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm, okay then, ready or not here I come\" said Renji<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his mouth opened wide.<br>\r\nAkira could see the strands of saliva in the dark mouth. The red slimy tongue filled with saliva. The huge white teeth glistening in the sun.<br>\r\nRenji licked his lips in anticipation. Coating his lips with a new coating of saliva.<br>\r\nHe brought the little morsel to his mouth and dropped him onto the wet tongue. Akira felt the hot saliva touching his skin. suddenly the tongue retracted and the lips closed. Trapping Akira in darkness. Renji then started playing with the little snack. Probing and Playing with him using his tongue. akira felt the tongue toss him around, plastering him on the roof of the mouth, pushing him to each slimy cheek, pinning him under the huge wet tongue, coating every inch of him with  Renji's slippery saliva. Renji then started to moan obviously liking the flavor of the little human.<br>\r\nSuddenly Akira was tossed to the back of the mouth.<br>\r\n\"This is the end\" he thought to himself<br>\r\n\"I love you renji\" he finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was light flooding inside of the mouth and he was spat out. Covering him with a puddle of saliva.<br>\r\n\"Huh, why didn't you swallow master\" said Akira<br>\r\n\"Cause your freaking cute that's why, and plus you said you loved me right?\" said Renji with a red face.<br>\r\n\"Yo-you heard that?! so embarrassing\" said akira while covering his face.<br>\r\n\"Well I'd like to keep you somewhere, before I resume eating if you don't mind.<br>\r\n\"sure!\".<br>\r\n\"hmm I guess I'll put you on my soft balls\" Renji then proceeded to put Akira on his ball sac making sure he was nice and comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji then proceeded to grab the other people and bring them to his face.<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth wide and dropped them on his tongue and pulled them in.<br>\r\nHe swirled them around on his mouth. Playing with the crowd using his tongue, covering them with saliva.<br>\r\nHe then began to transfer all the people into one side of his cheek. showing a bulge to the people out side. He then proceeded to move the group to the back of his mouth and swallowed along with a big batch of saliva. Outside you could see the big lump travel down his neck and disappear into his chest.<br>\r\n\"Shit, that tasted good. I can still feel the bugs squirming behind my abs\" he said while stroking his muscular abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in his stomach, the people were all being dissolved and drowned in the acidic puddle. They could hear the loud thumps of Renji's heart and the loud voice of Renji reverberating inside the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that he grabbed even more people and dropped them in.  Each grouped being tossed around the gigantic mouth and being played around with the giant tongue savoring the taste of the tiny morsels and coating them with saliva. After each group has been swallowed and deposited to Renji's stomach, he laid down and burped.<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh, im stuffed, I can still feel them in my stomach their movements feel good behind my abs, its like eating live meat, and better yet they taste so good\" said a satisfied renji<br>\r\n\" I also got a rise out of that said Renji, rubbing his erection up and down, feeling pleasure from the bugs in his stomach\" <br>\r\nSuddenly he remembered his little cute tiny.<br>\r\nHe looked down to his balls and saw akira sleeping, nestled on his sweaty balls, using the skin as a make shift pillow, rubbing his face onto the sweaty flesh and getting a whiff of Renji's wrinkly ball sac.<br>\r\nSuddenly Renji got a even harder, he couldn't resist playing with himself using the cute Akira.<br>\r\nHe woke him up and said Akira I want you to....</span></div></div>",

Probably off on his crazy antics again he thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway time to get out of these clothes,\" he sighed. First came the shirt, or what was left of it, which he tossed on the bed revealing the mass of muscle underneath. Both of his arms were larger than normal, each bulging with rippling muscle. His pecs were bulging larger too, they had swelled up to point where they began to jut out from his chest. His stunning six pack was visible as well, each muscle now larger and more defined against his skin. Even his back was filled with muscle, his shoulders now broad and thick with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ichigo got to his pants he decided to take off his shoes first, since the pain was becoming unbearable. He bent over and took of both shoes one at a time, \"Ahhh, much better,\" he moaned. \"Well might as well take the rest off too.\" Ichigo reached down and took off his sweaty socks one by one, as he did though he noticed each foot had grown larger. His feet must be around size 15, although they still retained their muscled look and silky feel. \"Aww man, those things were killing me,\" he sighed as he slowly massaged his massive feet to relieve the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally came the pants, which he took off and threw on his bed,\"Ohhhh, sweet freedom,\" moaned Ichigo, finally free from his prison. Ichigo now stood nearly naked, leaving him in his boxers (and with a sizable bulge as well). His legs were now thicker than they ever were, each filled with toned thick muscle and greater length then before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo then started to search through his clothes to find something that would fit his now bulkier frame. However he had no such luck, every shirt could not contain his massive pecs and meaty arms, and every pair of pants would just tear from the strain of holding his thick muscled legs. By some miracle the boxers he had on managed to contain the massive bulge he sported (although they left nothing to the imagination.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two hours of searching Ichigo finally gave up. As he strode to his bed though he caught a look of himself in the mirror. The man who was starring back at him was not the usual lean muscled soul reaper but now a taller, stronger, and sexier version of the original. \"I don't know what is causing this, but I'm liking the results,\" he said to himself as he flexed his bulging muscles in the mirror. After posing for some time, Ichigo decided to relax on his bed and continue relishing his new bulging body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the midst of his pleasure, he noticed something strange was in the air...</span></div></div>",

Finally, he took off his boxers, leaving himself completely naked and ready to take a shower. Ichigo was a well endowed guy to begin with, do he did not give any particular notice to his larger manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he was inside the shower washing his now god-like body and, at the same time, thinking of what might have caused his unexplained growth.<br>\r\nThe water felt great and that feeling of sickness he had at the beginning of the day was now gone for good. While exiting the shower he noticed himself in the bathroom mirror again. He cleaned the mirror, which had become blurred from the steam, with a towel and looked at his body. He wasn't any bigger, but his wet body looked extremely hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter posing some more in front of the mirror he dried himself, went to his room and wore a clean pair of boxers (the only thing that still fit him).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling thirsty, Ichigo, went back to his room to have some more of the lemonade he found in the bushes.

The lieutenant of squad six of the thirteen court guard squads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name is Renji Abarai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, in this man's head, he always believed that HE was better than Ichigo. He always belived that it was HE that Rukia liked more, despite the somewhat obvious idea that she just wanted to be friends. Renji didn't exactly mind, per se, but at the same time, he couldn't help but want a bit more. Every time he tried his best to impress the lady, he ended up being overshadowed by Ichigo. There finally came a point where he just decided to give up on the whole ordeal. It became such a competition, that he finally started to realize that maybe he just doesn't stand much of a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to him, that was all going to change on this very day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cloudy day in the Soul Society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renji...\" Byakuya said to his leiutenant as he passed him in the hallway that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Sir?\" He said, noticing the strange tone in his captain's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... Kurotsuchi was searching for you earlier...\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Why me?\" Renji asked, curious about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. He said it was some grand experiment to help pick up the slack due to the incident caused by Aizen.\" Byakuya told Renji. \"He was gathering up all the male leiutenants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the leiutenants?\" Renji said, questioning it. \"What about the captains?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not needed.\" Byakuya replied. \"He said male leiutenants only.\" He then began to walk away from Renji. \"It would be in your best interest to attend his little event.\" Byakuya then said, making a casual threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji just groaned. He really didn't WANT to go see that creepy captain... But at the same time, he knew he had to. He began to move onward, heading to the reseach and development labs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Later that day--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri Kurotsuchi had all the lieutenants lined up, side by side, in a large, well-lit room. He paced back and forth before them as he began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have gathered you all here today to try out a new little experiement we've developed here.\" The man said, looking up as he kept moving. \"A... drug, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one really bothered to speak up against the captain. However, it didn't stop their imaginations from wondering just what on earth this so-called \"drug\" was... Let alone if they would be the ones taking it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This drug is designed to exponentially increase the amount of spiritual energy one's body can hold.\" He continued. \"However, this drug has gone completely untested. When my colleagues suggested we try this out by other means...\" Kurotsuchi then glanced at all the lieutenants, \"I proposed that we try it out on something a little more... Useful.\" He chuckled darkly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But Kurotsuchi! That's insane!\" Izuru called out, standing out amongst his fellow lieutenants. \"What if something were to go wrong, and resulted in serious injury!? Even death!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but I've considered that.\" Kurotsuchi said. \"As a matter of fact...\" He grinned darkly as he turned his full body to the line of men. \"I've already got plenty of men lined up to replace any of you in case someone were to die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome men took a large gulp. Others began to shout. Renji couldn't quite hear what they were saying when they all yelled at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna take this!\" Hisagi said, walking for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother trying that.\" Kurotsuchi said, not moving an inch. \"I've sealed off the exit entirely. No one gets in or out until you've done as I instructed.\" Hisagi backed up a little, gritting his teeth. It looks like Kurotsuchi had already thought of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we make this fun!?\" Kurotsuchi said with a wide grin. \"I'll mix in some placebos with the drugs!\" He said, \"That way, some of you will live, and some of you MIGHT get power far beyond that of all the captains combined!\" He cackled, loving this new idea he suddenly thought of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we even have a choice?\" Iba blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... No.\" Kurotsuchi said, after giving it a moment of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, he handed out the pills to each lieutenant. Each pill looked, felt, and smelled identical to the other. He then turned to tehm, looking at each man as they looked at their pill. To think that their lives could hang in the balance of this one, tiny little drug,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swallow.\" Kurotsuchi then said. With that, each man seemed to down the pill, some more hesitent than others. Renji was one of these few. However, in the end, each man took the pill as they were instructed.  Little did they all know, Renji was the only one who had actually taken the drug.</span></div></div>",

Well enough of that boring details lets get to the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro was out just walking to 12th squad barracks while Rangiku passed by.<br>\r\n\"what are you doing captain?\" Rangiku asked.<br>\r\n\"well nothing but i got a job for you, I want you to help out on the guys who are looking for bodies to be healed by Captain Unohana\" Toshiro instructed.<br>\r\n\"yeh I was going to help out the guys. well then see ya later\" Rangiku shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i dont think I should do it\" Toshiro thought to himself.<br>\r\nWell that night while Rangiku came to Toshiro's room. Rangiku went in his room to put in a present, which was a small bag of watermelon lollies. The next day all of the sudden \"WAH\" Toshiro woke up as if that he had a nightmare.<br>\r\n\"what was that dream about, me getting larger\" Toshiro thought. \"huh? a present...\" Toshiro shakes the present and said with no surprise \"no doubting it... its from Ukitake\"<br>\r\nJust then Rangiku came in his room. \"whats wrong? and also, ohh..... so you opened the present from me and started eating it\" Rangiku laughed<br>\r\nTrue Toshiro did eat the watermelon lollies that were inside, 1 by 1. \" \"it was from you\" Toshiro said then popped another one of the watermelon lollies in.<br>\r\n\"oh shit i just remembered CAPTAIN STOP EATING THE LOLLIES\" Rangiku shouted. \"why? they're my favorite lollies\" Toshiro said.<br>\r\n\"they're height growing lollies. I got them from Captain Kurostchi of the 12th squad\" Rangiku explained.<br>\r\n\"oh crap. I already ate 3 quarters of the bag *panics*\" Toshiro said as he panics. \"well no change happening there\" Rangiku replied. \"phew... i guess i will look for a remedy for this height growing lollie\" Toshiro said in a calm voice.<br>\r\n2 hours later toshiro was taking his afternoon nap while rangiku was out with her sword Haineko (in materialization mode A.K.A: a living sword and i also added this cus it would be more funny) Rangiku and haineko were obviously looking for Hyorimaru. \"cmon that ice fart where is he\" Haineko said. \"he should be at the barracks right now\" Rangiku replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they came back to the squad 10  barracks and heard Toshiro screaming like in pain. \"OHHHH SHIT!\" (im sorry about the swear words) Then Haineko and Rangiku ran to Toshiro's office where he does his work.<br>\r\nJust then when they stopped at the door of Toshiro's office  when they saw Hyorimaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" i think toshiro grew, AS LONG AS A GILLION\" Hyorimaru shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the 3 came in it was true Toshiro grew very big. \"take him outside he will grow longer\" Rangiku instructed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they took Toshiro out and he grew longer. 50 inches difference, The 3 thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n so now that little toshiro grew to big toshiro what is he going to do? <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

As soon as that was said, Toshiro woke up and stands up. <br>\r\n\"Woah.... what the heck happened, im tall as the execution tower\" Toshiro said. Rangiku used shunpo and teleports to Toshiro's right shoulder.<br>\r\n \"Whatever you do, do not move... your tall as and I dont see how effective those freakin candies were. After this im just going to kill Kurostchi\" Rangiku said.<br>\r\nJust after this Toshiro grabbed Rangiku and suddenly went to hentai mode (Hentai means pervert otherwise idiot) and started to lick Rangiku. Sine Toshiro grew about 100 meters long and is about to grow more you would expect Toshiro just to use the tip of his tongue, but he licked her using all of his tongue.

Multiple shinigami appeared on the ground at his toes, trying to slice away at them. His feet were originally a size 4. His feet were well taken care of. The soles were smooth and the toes were not too plump or too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shinigami's efforts were in vain. As he gathered up shinigami between his feet. He slowly mushed their bodies between his toes, popping their heads like grapes with no effort at all as he let out a groan of pleasure. Splatters of blood could be seen on and between his toes. As multiple captain level shinigami surrounded him, he thought that it'd be best to retreat for now. He was much faster than them now due to the combination of shunpo and his giant stature. In a matter of seconds, he was outside of seireitei. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to continue his rampage in Rukongai, stepping on the innocent souls of civilians with his bare feet; child like, but deadly. Hitsugaya entered a district. A foot shaped shadow was cast over a group of people, as they turned around in horror. Toshiro's left foot smashed down onto their bodies, killing most of them on impact. There were screams underneath his foot, muffled under the skin of his sole<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will all die under my bare feet. For years people have always been stepping on me. Picking on the short guy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO'S LAUGHING NOW!?\" Toshiro shouted as he twisted the ball of his foot into the victims of Hitsugaya, grinding their bodies into the earth under his weight, through the power of his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made one last groan of pleasure as he grinded the survivors trapped underneath his cute toes, they were squashed beneath them, never to be seen again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are all nothing before me, I will crush each and every one of you like bugs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya was showing a side which he had never really shown before. As he walked off, there was a large imprint of a Toshiro's left foot from where he had completely massacred people underneath his sole. Nothing left but an imprint of a sole and 5 toes, splattered with blood and dirt. The FEW who survived were left immobile. Toshiro continued rampaging through rukongai, getting hornier and hornier. Deadlier and deadlier as he stomped through buildings and shinigami like nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnding their lives with his BARE FEET.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were the Gotei 13 going to do? Would they send someone, or would Toshiro strike first?</span></div></div>",

While he was doing this, however, Renji was thinking about something. For some reason... he wanted that jar of slime. He wanted to grow, and be bigger than he already was. He wanted to watch himself slowly begin ripping out of his too small clothes! Just the though of it made want to go crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis train of thought was soon interupted as Jinta Yelled, \"Found it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji watched as Jinta easily grabbed the jar at his new height, and walked up to him. He was now a few inches taller than him, and he had also noticed that Jinta's muscles had developed as he had grown. His biceps, calves, and thighs were wider and more defined looking then before, while his pecs were jutting out slightly. It wasn't very noticable yet, but he was also developing a well sculpted six-pack. Jinta's shirt had fallen off of him, as it had ripped down the back a few mintues ago, while his pants now only reached slightly past his knees. His toes had burst through the front of his socks, and Renji could here the rest of the material slowly stretching and tearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta tapped his foot impatiently. \"Well, are you going to look it over, or what!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji nodded, and grabbed the jar, \"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had it in his hands! Renji opened he jar and dumped all the slime onto himself, and watched as it disapeared under his skin. Jinta stood there with his mouth gaping, being to shocked to talk. He finally found the power to talk and yelled, \"The Hell!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji sat against the wall, putting his hands behind his head. He smiled, and simply said, \"I'm going to enjoy this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta sighed, \"Once a moocher, ALWAYS a moocher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down beside Renji, and watched as he ever so slowly began growing. Renji was grinning a massive grin, know what was coming. It took a while for it become noticeable though. He felt his clothes grow tighter, and his muscles began to feel tense. He could feel the material of his clothes stretching, and slightly ripping in a few places. His pecs jutting out slightly, making the front of his shirt also begin ripping. Renji then put his legs in front of him, and could see that his ankles and a slight part of his leg were now being revealed. More of his leg was slowly reavealed as time progressed. He stared at his feet, and watched as they also began growing in length and width. His toes began pushing over the edge of his sandals, and soon, were completely over them. The strap soon ripped as he continued growing, and his foot caused his socks to begin ripping at the front. His toes pushed through, and little rips appeared all over his socks. His uniform looked embarrisly small on him, and was now shredding at the seems. His calves continued to push out a widen, while his thighs did the same. His six-pack slowly beame rock hard, while his pecs continued  to jut out. His head slowly inched higher and higher against the wall, and he was soon taller than Jinta again. Jinta looked up at Renji as he continued to grow, seeing that he was literally going crazy with exitement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Jinta whined, \"How come you're growing bigger and faster than me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji stood up, causing his shirt to burst off, \"Who knows, and who cares? Let's just enjoy this kid. Hell, we can dp whatever we want if this continues!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, this brought up the question of WHAT they were going to do. Renji, now about eight feet tall, and Jinta, now about seven feet tall, began thinking. They decide to....  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn't like this one bit. He had never experienced anything remotely similar to this, nor had he ever heard of anything similar to this. It seemed impossible yet the evidence of it was staring him directly in the face. Literally! Jinta had been slowly expanding this entire time and was now face to face with Renji. In a few more minutes, if his rate of growth remained the same, Jinta would be taller than him! The kid was enough of a troublemaker at normal size. Renji shuddered to think what he would be like as a mini giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I found it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji quickly walked over and reached for the jar. Jinta jerked it out of his grasp and said, \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it look like I'm doing? I'm trying to examine this slime.\" Renji replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I found it, I want to look it over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen kid, I don't have time for this! Just hand it over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what?\" Jinta asked, stretching up to his full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji gulped a little when he saw that the boy was now a few inches taller than he was. The white shirt was starting to reach the bottom of his chest, the sleeves tearing up towards the shoulders while the shoulders themselves started to create rips. More of his back was being exposed as the rip slowly made it's way down. His pants were full on shorts, riding just above the knee. It was strange and slightly intimidating to this boy standing taller than him while still be proportionate to the kid he was. But Renji got over it quickly and reached for the jar. Jinta was too slow to prevent the Soul Reaper from grabbing the jar but he wasn't too slow to lose his own grip on it. The two began to struggle for it, the slime sluggishly running up and down the jar. All the while they wrestled Jinta continued growing, reaching higher and higher until Renji was up to his chest. His shirt was nothing more than tatters now while his pants were tearing along his thighs revealing his white briefs. With his new height advantage Jinta jerked the jar up and Renji lost his grip. Unfortunately, Jinta also lost his grip and the jar went flying out of his grasp where it crashed into the ceiling, shattering on impact and raining the slime down on Jinta's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" Renji shouted seeing Jinta get doused in more growth slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta grinned evilly and said, \"Yo should have just let me see the jar. Now I'm going to be huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid was annoying but right. Renji could already see the red headed boy's size increasing faster destroying the last rags of his shirt and pants, leaving him in his underwear only. The growth spiked slightly and Jinta felt his head crash into the ten foot ceiling. Renji was now somewhere around his waist, half the size of the growing boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I think I stopped growing. I guess the more slime you use, the longer it takes to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji snorted. \"Way to jump to conclusions. What evidence do you have that that's the case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta frowned at the man below him and said, \"This!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning the boy punched Renji in the chest. The force of the blow was great than expected and Renji fell to the ground. Jinta flexed his fingers and said, \"Wow, I barely tried! That stuff must be making me stronger too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his hands on his hips and grinned evilly down at Renji. He was going to have some fun today...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo was preparing for another day at school, ready to bash Keigo if he was annoying, enjoy lunch with his friends, and possibly dash out of class to stop a few Hollows. What he wasn't expecting, was to run into a giant bare foot. Ichigo crashed head long into it as it suddenly appeared in front of him. Shaking his head he was shocked as he saw the foot in plain view. Standing up next to it he saw he was just slightly bigger than the big toe. Looking up past the ankle Ichigo saw the huge pillar like leg disappear into massive blue shorts that could house a circus and past an equally huge white shirt before resting on the giant's grinning face. It was that brat from Urahara's shop! Ichigo stared up at the humongous boy, wondering what the hell was going on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there little carrot top! Heading to school?\" Jinta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell happened to you? How did you get so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the least of your concerns right now little bug. You're coming with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ichigo could even think of protesting, Jinta reached down and wrapped his tree like fingers around Ichigo's comparatively tiny body. Ichigo struggled to escape the tight grasp but found it to be useless. Standing to his full height Jinta noticed that, even though it was early morning, he was starting to attract attention. He needed to find a more private place. He snapped his fingers thunderously as an idea came to him. He knew the perfect place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back to the ruins of Urahara's shop, Jinta pushed aside the debris with his toes until he found what he was looking for. There was a small trap door in the floor, leading down into Urahara's secret bunker. Leaning down, he shoved his index finger down the hole, shattering the door and leaving a large hole in the ground. Lifting up his foot he slammed it down on the small hole, completely obliterating the ground. After this was done he dropped Ichigo down into the bunker and prepared to lower himself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ichigo, it was a nightmare. He fell down, down, down, and would have shattered his body if he hadn't thought fast and went into Soul Reaper form. Catching his now prone body, he managed to land lightly on the ground by jumping off the towering cliffs. When his feet reached ground he set his body down and looked up to see what Jinta was doing. All he saw was the sole of a massive foot coming straight for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo grabbed his body again and ran like a bat out of hell, pushing himself as hard as he could to avoid being crushed like a bug under this over sized kid's foot. He barely managed to avoid death as the foot landed with an earth shaking thud. Ichigo was thrown off his feet by the wind created by the foot combined with the rumbling ground. Panting, he stared up while laying on his back and saw Jinta's other foot land a ways away, feeling the ground vibrate from the impact. The rest of his body was lowered with into the hole, the top part of his spiky red hair sticking out of the hole. Before turning his attention to Ichigo, he stood on his tip toes and reached over to the nearby houses. He grabbed one and it twisted apart in his grasp, leaving only the roof and a few splinters. He set the debris around the hole until it was concealed from sight. All anyone would see was a ruin. No one would disturb him and his new little toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this accomplished, Jinta bent over and scanned the ground looking for Ichigo. He was no where in sight. A feral grin spread across the boy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want to play games huh? Well that's fine with me! Ready or not, here I come bug boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo heard the booming voice of the boy from his hiding place inside a small cave. He had to avoid Jinta at all costs until he could escape and find help. Urahara had to be somewhere else beside the shop or this would have already been taken care of. The only question was, could Ichigo escape? Or would he be found?</span></div></div>",

He remained motionless as Jinta approached his hiding spot. One of the boy\u2019s bare feet landed outside the cave entrance. Ichigo watched silently as the foot remained still, except for the occasional wiggle of the toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder where carrot top ran off to? He couldn\u2019t have gone far.\u201d Jinta spoke out loud before continuing on past Ichigo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant boy was right outside, but he couldn\u2019t wait any longer. He had to sneak past him somehow. Suddenly, the entire cave started to shake violently. The Substitute Shinigami was thrown off his feet as the cave started to fall apart. Something was smashing against the side of the cave\u2026something big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better get out here now, carrot top, or else you\u2019ll be buried!\u201d Jinta commanded as he continued to kick the rock formation Ichigo was hiding in. He stopped when he saw his orange-haired toy run out of the cave wit his lifeless body. \u201cGood, at least now I don\u2019t have to worry about digging you out of there.\u201d Jinta approached the small figure, looking down at him with an evil grin. \u201cYou\u2019re pathetic. You were so scared that you forgot to hide your Reiatsu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not scared!\u201d Ichigo yelled as he unwrapped his Zanpakuto and pointed the blade at Jinta. \u201cIf you think just because you got a little taller you can turn me into some plaything, you\u2019re wrong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? You wanna fight, bug boy?\u201d Jinta\u2019s grin widened as he placed his hands on his hips. \u201cI don\u2019t mind creaming you; but are you sure your body will be alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo\u2019s eyes widened as he looked back at his human body. He was confident he could fight the giant by himself, but did he even stand a chance if he had to protect his body at the same time? COULD he even protect it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be, carrot top? Either hand over that butter knife of yours or we\u2019re going to have ourselves a brawl and I\u2018ll take it by force.\u201d Jinta looked like he was having a lot of fun. He smiled and started cracking his knuckles in order to further intimidate the older boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo cursed and glared up at the titan. What was he going to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take long for Ichigo to come to a decision. He was never one to just roll over and give up no matter how ridiculous or unbalanced the circumstances were. He had managed to push back a Menos Grande, surely Jinta couldn't be much different, right? Of course, Jinta was bigger than the Menos...but still! Ichigo set his body down by a small out cropping of rock and pointed his sword at Jinta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's my decision. I'm taking you out kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta laughed at Ichigo's bravado and said, \"You're choice insect. I just hope your body doesn't get crushed under one of THESE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said \"these\" Jinta slammed his right foot down directly in front of Ichigo, throwing the much smaller teen off of his feet once again. Without waiting for his prey to get back up, Jinta flicked him with his big toe sending Ichigo flying across the desert like expanse. Jinta smirked down at Ichigo's hiding spot for his body and pushed aside the rocks. He picked up the body and snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was just way too easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a wave of blue energy came flying towards him, hitting him in the hand and forcing him to drop the body. Ichigo, who had let loose a Getsuga Tensho, quickly grabbed his body again and set it down. Jinta, annoyed that Ichigo had surprised him (because he certainly hadn't hurt him), shouted in a thunderous voice, \"You're going to pay for that bug boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo turned and ran, doing his best to avoid the mammoth feet that were close behind him. Thinking fast, he stopped and raised his sword into the air, just as Jinta's foot came down on him. Jinta felt the sharp prick of the sword and jumped back, nearly knocking Ichigo to the ground yet again. Ichigo took this opportunity to grab his body and head for the exit. Just as he was in sight of the ladder that would lead him out of this nightmare the ground rumbled ferociously until it cracked and split apart under his feet. Ichigo had to toss his body to a safe area and grab on or else he would have fallen to his doom. Before he could pull himself out of the newly made chasm, two fleshy pink toes positioned themselves under his arms and hoisted him into the air. Ichigo managed to turn around and see Jinta's furious face glaring at him before he was slammed against a nearby cliff face. Now completely pinned and under Jinta's control, Ichigo could no longer fight. Jinta grinned evilly and reached over, taking the sword out of his tiny adversaries hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was fun carrot top but it's all over now. I don't want you getting your little hands on this thing again so I've come up with a great idea. You're going to go back into your body and give me the badge that you use to turn yourself into a Soul Reaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo, still holding onto his fierce and stubborn spirit, spat out, \"What if I don't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta merely reached over and picked up Ichigo's body by the scruff of his shirt. He shook the tiny body back and forth tauntingly and said, \"Well then I'll just do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado he opened his mouth and dropped the body onto his tongue. Ichigo watched in horror as the boy's thick saliva covered his human body. Jinta closed his mouth and gulped. Ichigo yelled out in horror at what just happened and Jinta laughed loudly at his expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax tiny! I didn't actually eat your body. I'm just teaching you a lesson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held out his palm and spit Ichigo's body into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you get my point. Now do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta moved his foot and allowed the Substitute Soul Reaper to fall onto the massive boy's palm next to his unconscious body. Sighing in defeat he knew he'd have to play along with Jinta's games...for now. He rejoined with his body and immediately yelled out in disgust. He was soaked all over in Jinta's saliva, thick ropes of it hanging off his arms and legs. He shook himself off and spit a few times even though there was nothing inside it. Jinta roared with laughter at Ichigo's struggles and dropped the tiny teen between his legs. Ichigo tossed the badge at him angrily but Jinta merely caught it and tossed it in his mouth. This time he really did swallow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I just left this thing lying around somewhere you could your hands on it again. I'm not going to let that happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo glared up at his gigantic captor and wondered what horrors were in store for him next.</span></div></div>",

Then, Jinta got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, chasing you around and kicking your ass did a number on my feet,\" Jinta said as he massaged his left foot with his hand. \"Be a good slave and rub them, would ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave? Since when am I your slave?!\" Ichigo yelled up at his captor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I mention it? Not only are you my toy, but you're also my first slave. Although...I guess the two aren't really that different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to pay for this, you little brat.\" the spikey-haired teen continued to glare up at the giant. Jinta didn't seem to notice or just didn't care about the small bug's opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he positioned his soles on either side of the tiny teen and forcibly brought them together. Ichigo yelped as he was squeezed between two walls of rugged, sweaty flesh. Jinta started to grind his feet together, ignoring his captive's screams. After a couple a minutes he released Ichigo, who had to pull himself free of one of the soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you understand your position better now? Rub my feet or else I'll give you another rubdown. This time, however, I won't stop until your flattened beyond recognition!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay! I'll do it.\" Ichigo cursed to himself before looking up the expanse of one of Jinta's soles. There was no way he could rub all of it unless he climbed it. Nevertheless, not wanting to upset his new master further, began to drag his palms over the rough skin of the boy's foot. Jinta sighed as he leaned back against a small hill, satisfied that he had finally shown carrot top his place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-haired kid's feet were covered in dust and rubble from running around down here, but that wasn't Ichigo's biggest complaint. The kid had worked up a sweat in this hot room and it felt like a slime as it covered the teenager's hands. Luckily, the feet didn't smell as bad as he thought. Jinta must of taken a shower pretty recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget the other one, carrot top. I want you soaking in my foot sweat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo mumbled under his breath as he worked on the other sole. He hoped wherever Urahara was, he wouldn't be there much longer. If this was his doing, he must have some way of reversing it. Still, Ichigo couldn't rely on that geezer for everything. He had been known to be out for weeks. Luck would give him an opportunity sooner or later... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ichigo sighed as he thought his work was over only to have the same two toes that picked him up before lift him into the air. The force of the movement kicked Ichigo out from between Jinta's toes and straight towards the giant boy's face. Ichigo slammed full tilt into Jinta's forehead, his body, slick with foot sweat, slipping down until he was straddling the nose. Ichigo clung to the bridge as best he could to avoid slipping off the edge of the nose and down to his doom on the rocky ground below. Jinta laughed at Ichigo's antics and plucked him easily off his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did a passable job carrot top but you're not much fun by yourself. There's an entire city up there waiting for me to play with and I'm going to make it wait any longer! Besides, it'll be nice to have some other toys to bring back down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo, clenched in Jinta's fist, shouted, \"You can't! You'll destroy the city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta gave Ichigo a pained looked and said, \"Well duh! When you're my size you can't help but destroy things. Get with the program bug boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta stood up to his full height, his red spikes flattened slightly by the ceiling, and made his way over to the hole. Just as he was about to hoist himself out of hidden room he remembered Ichigo in his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...it would be a pain in the ass to carry you everywhere. But if I leave you free in my pocket or something you'll probably escape. Oh! I've got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo didn't know what Jinta had planned but he knew it couldn't be good. He watched as the titanic boy scanned the remains of the shop looking for something. After about two minutes of searching he found what he was looking for. He opened his fist allowing Ichigo to stand on his palm and dangled a rope in front of him. Ichigo instantly shook his head and said, \"No way! You are not tying me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes I am! You're going to get tied somewhere on my body so you don't get any funny ideas about escaping. I've got two places picked out for you. First, you can spend more time with my foot as I tie you to my toe. But if you want a break from them for awhile I could just use you as a necklace. So, what will it be? You've got thirty seconds before I choose for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo weighed both options in his mind. If he was tied to the foot again he would have to endure a sweaty torture as Jinta stomped around his city. He would be relatively safe tied down to the toes but if Jinta kicked he could be crushed or have something collapse on him. If he chose the necklace then he'd be safer than on the foot out of the direct path of Jinta's destruction. However, he would also be hundreds of feet in the air, swinging precariously on a piece of old rope. If the rope snapped, he would likely be a pancake on the ground. If the rope snapped and he somehow managed to not hit the ground he would be loose on a part of Jinta's body which would be even more dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better hurry up carrot top! Ten seconds!\" Jinta cut into Ichigo's thoughts with a malicious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, which one? What should Ichigo choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cUgh\u2026you\u2019re necklace!\u201d Ichigo replied, making a quick decision. It seemed like the safest choice. He wouldn\u2019t get caught in any destruction Jinta made. Plus, if the rope did fail, he would at least have a chance to save himself from plummeting to his death.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, good choice. I don\u2019t usually wear accessories, but I\u2019ll make an exception for you, carrot top.\u201d Jinta chuckled as he slid the rope under Ichigo\u2019s arms and tied a knot around his torso. He held his new \u201cnecklace\u201d by its two ends and admired it in front of his boyish face. After smiling with approval, he brought the two ends of the rope behind his neck and tied them together. Ichigo was swung through the air before he crashed into the young boy\u2019s chest, getting a face-full of his white shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his new toy was safely secured, Jinta wasted no time in punching away the debris he had used to cover the hole in the ceiling. He grabbed the edges of the gap and hoisted himself up through any remaining rubble. Once he was outside, he immediately noticed a crowd that had gathered around the ruins of the shop. To them it appeared as if a red-haired behemoth had broken its way through the earth\u2019s surface. Once Jinta had lifted himself completely out of the secret room, he stood up to his full height and breathed in the fresh air. He then looked down at the onlookers and waved, smiling innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there. Sorry for the mess, couldn\u2019t really help it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe townsfolk stared at the giant for a few moments in disbelief. The silence was broken when they erupted into screams and scattered in a panic. Jinta just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTough crowd.\u201d he muttered before making his way forward. The people below franticly tried to get out of the way before they ended up squashed under the kid\u2019s soles. Ichigo could do nothing but watch and hope everyone got out of the way quickly. A man who was driving down the street stopped when he saw the approaching boy and fled his car. Jinta\u2019s bare foot pressed down on the automobile and easily flattened it into scrap metal. When he lifted his foot back up, the car remained stuck to his sole for a few steps before finally falling off in a heap of ruined metal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta didn\u2019t really know where to go. He just wanted to stir up some chaos, so he decided the easiest way was to just trek forward. The boy folded his arms behind his head, closed his eyes, and relaxed as he allowed his feet to take him forward. There wasn\u2019t like there was a wall he was going to bump into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he did bump into a wall. Several of them. Jinta\u2019s feet walked through one house after another, not worrying about any people that may have been in them. He tore through several blocks in only a couple minutes. Jinta\u2019s simple walk was like a tornado to the unexpecting town below. To Ichigo, it was like a ride from hell. Every step made him lurch forward, only to be tossed back into Jinta\u2019s gigantic form. When Jinta felt like he had walked enough, he turned around to inspect his work. A clearly visible path of destruction was visible , cutting though shops and homes. Flattened cars, trees, and other junk had been left in Jinta\u2019s wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome.\u201d was all the chaotic kid could say. \u201cIt felt like I was walking through grass.\u201d Jinta\u2019s gaze turned from the destruction he caused to Ichigo. \u201cStill hanging in there, carrot top? You\u2019re a shitty Soul Reaper, but you make a pretty good necklace.\u201d The red-haired boy pulled on Ichigo a few times to make sure the rope was still tight before turning back to the town. Karakura Town was a big place, so there was still a lot more to do. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I got a great idea! I'm going to test my strength!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked up in horror as he heard this. It was bad enough when the giant boy had just been walking. Now he was going to actively devastate the city? This wasn't going to end well. In addition, Ichigo could feel bruises starting to form along his body where he had continually crashed into Jinta's chest. It was like getting thrown over and over again into a concrete wall. Reaching down Jinta flicked Ichigo, as though he could read Ichigo's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're thinking bug boy. You really need to stop complaining about what your master does. Instead, think about how you're going to serve me when I get tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo considered shouting back and insulting the boy, but then he remembered how easily Jinta could smash him under his feet or, he shuddered to think, swallow him whole. Jinta laughed and stood tall with his hands on his hips, surveying the land. What would be a good challenge for him? He decided to start small and work his way up. He stomped over to a house and put his foot on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how much force it takes to crush this house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta slowly started applying pressure. Instantly he could hear and feel the house start to splinter under his foot. He added a little more pressure and could hear objects falling and crashing inside the house followed by the sounds of the support snapping. Getting bored with taking his time he put his foot down and the whole structure instantly shattered under his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even close to being a challenge! What's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to a much larger building next, one that reached his knees. He looked down at Ichigo and said, \"What do you think tiny? How many kicks will it take to destroy this building?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the hell up and leave me out of this!\" Ichigo spat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta flicked him again and said, \"One more outburst like that and you're riding inside my shirt for the rest of the day. I'm warning you, it'll probably get sweaty in there. Plus, if you fall off I might not notice and squish you. You don't want to be a stain under your god's foot do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so he's a god now?\" Ichigo muttered spitefully, making sure that Jinta didn't hear. He didn't like the idea of riding inside the boy's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? How many?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta grinned and said, \"Watch it fall in two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRearing back as far as he could Jinta smashed his bare foot through the glass front of the building. It instantly shattered, half of it collapsing to the ground. Countless people could have been inside, but from his vantage point Ichigo couldn't tell. The Soul Society could be having a major influx of souls after the day was over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to his word, with the second kick Jinta leveled the building. He laughed and ground the debris into the ground even further. \"Pathetic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta crossed his arms and looked around. He smiled widely as his eyes landed on the biggest building in the city. It was a few (relative) feet bigger than Jinta and slightly wider. He stretched his arms and rolled his shoulder as he looked around for something to make this particular bit of destruction more fun. He saw another building nearby that was just about the right size. He grabbed the base of it and hoisted it whole out of the ground. This building was made of sterner stuff than the others and didn't instantly fall apart in his hands. Gripping the base of it he held it in a classic batter stance and said, \"And the stadium goes silent as Jinta steps up to the plate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was, of course, not even close to being true as the people of the city were in mass panic, running every which way to avoid getting smashed under the giant's foot or by debris caused by the giant's rampage. Ichigo rolled his eyes as he heard the boy's make believe. This was just getting worse every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pitcher looks scared as Jinta glares fiercely at him. It looks like it's going to be another home run folks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the building back and said, \"Here's the pitch! It's a fastball headed straight towards Jinta! He pulls back on the bat and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta swung with full force, the smaller building smashing through the larger one. Half the building crashed down into the lower half of it, causing the whole structure to collapse. Tossing the smaller building up into the air he cheered, \"The crowd goes wild! No one can compare to Jinta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller building crashed down onto a grouping of smaller buildings as well as a section of the road. Several people who had been fleeing in that direction stopped dead in their tracks and immediately headed in a different direction. Jinta, meanwhile was thinking of other ways he could have fun. Ichigo swung morosely from his rope prison and wondered what the kid would do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNow, I think next I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d Jinta began to say when suddenly he was distracted by a soft popping noise. He listened closer and noticed their were several of them. The giant looked around for the source until his eyes fell upon the road behind him. Three patrol cars and around six cops were shooting at him. They had actually been attacking him for a couple minutes, but Jinta just now noticed them. The police were shooting blindly; some hit Jinta\u2019s arm while others hit his back. No matter where they struck, though, they simply bounced off Jinta\u2019s concrete-like skin. The god of a boy smirked at the bug\u2019s futile attempts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, what a surprise.\u201d Jinta said in a loud, deep voice. He turned around to face the cops and put his hands on his hips. The men immediately stopped firing when they were met with the giant\u2019s gaze. They all froze up with fear. \u201cYou\u2019re a bunch of nasty cops, aren\u2019t you? Shooting at me like that, even though I\u2019m just a kid! You need to be taught a lesson.\u201d Jinta turned around again so the cops were once again looking at the giant\u2019s back. They thought he was leaving for some reason and were about to take this chance to flee. Jinta has other plans, though, as he bent his knees and started to fall back. The police looked up in terror as Jinta\u2019s jean-clad butt descended down upon them. They didn\u2019t even have the chance to scream before the ass hit the pavement with an earth-shattering boom. The force of the impact shattered windows of any nearby buildings that were still standing. Jinta grinned toothily as he swerved his butt back and forth. Metal and humans alike were ground up until neither was recognizable. Jinta picked himself back onto his feet and inspected the ground. A clean imprint of his butt had been grounded into the road. The sight made Jinta crack up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess they learned their lesson!\u201d Jinta exclaimed through his laughing. Using his hand to brush away the debris on is butt, the boy was about to walk away when he heard yet another sound bothering him. This time a buzzing noise. \u201cWhat now?\u201d Jinta looked in the direction of the bothersome noise to see a police helicopter hovering by his head. The copter tried to back off, but a giant hand stopped it in its place. The spinning blades were brought to a screeching halt by the boy\u2019s tree-like fingers. Jinta peered into the flying machine to see two people: the pilot and another cop holding something that looked like a sniper rifle. The man with the gun opened the window and started shooting at Jinta\u2019s face. A pointless effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t learn, do ya? What am I going to do with you?\u201d Jinta looked around for a moment until he spotted a tall building in the distance. The red head gripped the copter in his hand as he got into a pitching position. His eyes were locked onto the distant building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce again the stadium is quiet as Jinta is about to throw his third ball to home plate. The top-batter on the opponent\u2019s side has two strikes. One more and he\u2019s out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscles in Jinta\u2019s arms tensed up as he got ready to throw. The cops inside the helicopter, who could hear everything, tried desperately to get out. Unfortunately, Jinta\u2019s fingers were blocking the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime itself stops for this one moment. Jinta Hanakari gives the frightened batter one last smile before\u2026HE THROWS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Jinta uses every ounce of his strength to throw the helicopter through the air like a baseball. Soon after leaving the giant\u2019s hands, the vehicle exploded into a burning fireball. The fireball smacked into the building ahead and burst out from the other side. Jinta watched as the entire building caught on fire and slowly burned to the ground. The merciless titan pumped his fist into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrike three! He\u2019s OUT! Once again, Jinta is superior to everyone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo, who had been watching everything in shock, gritted his teeth in anger. There was no way he could watch all this and remain silent! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid your growth spurt ruin your mind?!\u201d Ichigo shouted up at his captor. Jinta, who was surprised to hear Ichigo talk back to him again, looked down at him. Did he not just warn him a few minutes ago? \u201cThose are people you killed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t blame me.\u201d Jinta replied simply. \u201cThey attacked me first. It was self defense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you\u2026\u201d The Soul Reaper\u2019s eye twitched in anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, what did I say about those outbursts?\u201d Jinta asked as he flicked Ichigo against his chest. \u201cI warned you, buggy.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Into the shirt you go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo, deciding that since he was already being punished anyway, screamed curses at Jinta as his tree trunk like fingers gripped him tightly and raised him slowly into the air. Clearly Jinta was savoring these moments. With his other hand the massive boy pulled down the collar of his shirt and dangled Ichigo in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun down there Substitute Insect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado Ichigo dropped into the semi dark recesses of enlarged cotton and human flesh. Jinta let the collar go and Ichigo was left alone. He wiggled around slightly to check the durability of the rope. Luckily they were still holding. When he was dropped he had bounced slightly when the rope reached its full length. He was worried that the tension might have weakened the rope. Now that he was sure he wasn't going to suddenly plunge to what could be his doom he took stock of his situation. Since Jinta was wearing a white shirt the daylight was filtering through it somewhat giving enough light for Ichigo to see. Below him he could make out the long expanse of flesh that was Jinta's stomach, completely uninterrupted except for a, relatively, small hole that was his navel. The street was visible below that along with buildings and the constantly shifting mass that was Jinta's legs and feet. Looking up, Ichigo could see Jinta's face staring straight ahead, occasionally looking down with a devilish smirk to survey the damage he was causing. Jinta had been right before. The air was distinctly warmer, the somewhat musky smell relieved by the occasional stray breeze that wafted up through the boy's shirt. Already he could feel beads of sweat forming on his forehead while his back was starting to moisten thanks to the sweat on Jinta's chest. Clearly he was exerting himself in his fun. Now every time he flew back and smacked into Jinta's head a wet plopping sound was heard accompanied by a small splash of sweat. It was sickening to Ichigo. He was already regretting his previous outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Ichigo suffered even more in his captivity, Jinta was continuing his jaunt around town. The police had wised up and realized there was no way they could possibly stop Jinta with conventional weapons. So they had contacted the nearest army base and were awaiting major reinforcements. While they waited for these reinforcements to arrive they had set up several bombs in strategic locations around the city. Hopefully these would be enough to slow the giant down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly their efforts were in vain as Jinta stepped on the first trap. The bomb exploded around his feet and went completely unnoticed. Jinta didn't even feel a tickle. When the next trap went off around his knees he still didn't notice it. Thus far all the police had accomplished was destroying more of the city. When the third bomb went off somewhere around Jinta's waist he finally took notice of them. He looked down in surprise at wreckage he didn't cause and his face darkened in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, who the hell is destroying things behind my back? This is my city to play with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo fumed at hearing these words but kept his lip zipped. If he was too outspoken again he might very well end up someplace worse than this. Jinta bent down over the newly made wreckage and scanned it for anyone or anything that might have destroyed it. When he saw the twisted remains of the bombs he raised an eyebrow quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who puts bombs inside an office building? That's just stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling over to a different office building he looked it over to see if there was a bomb in it as well. As his fingers trailed over the fourth story windows an explosion erupted, blasting the windows out and sending the first four floors plummeting to the ground along with several of the floors above it. Jinta grinned and said, \"Oh man. Were these supposed to hurt me? That's hilarious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta rose to his feet again, dusting off his hands and still chuckling at the efforts of the bugs below him. When would they learn to just accept their new god? Oh well. They'd learn in time. Meanwhile there was still more fun to be had! Jinta shielded his eyes so he could see better and scanned the landscape around him. What would be a good place to have fun in next? The city was starting to show that it was currently housing a giant, with destroyed buildings everywhere, smoke rising from the ruins, people still screaming and running, cars causing build ups in the streets as they strove to escape, and the occasional police megaphone blaring, \"Don't panic! The situation is under control!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta chuckled at that last statement. There was nothing that could control him. Nothing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo wiped away the sweat on his forehead and groaned in discomfort. If it wasn\u2019t for the occasional cool breeze, it\u2019d be like an oven in here. He was supposed to stay in here for the entire day? He\u2019d probably suffocate before then! As he was trying to figure a way out of this deathtrap, he suddenly noticed the rope wasn\u2019t as tight around his waist as before. The humid air combined with the perspiration of the two males must have started to loosen it. This was both a good thing and bad. On the bright side, he\u2019d finally be free and didn\u2019t have to be this oversize brat\u2019s accessory anymore. However, he\u2019d also lose the only thing keeping him from freefalling down the boy\u2019s clothes. Fate didn\u2019t give him much time to go over the situation as the knot untied itself and freed the teen\u2019s body. Ichigo thought fast and grabbed the rope with both hands to stop his fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, upper body strength, don\u2019t fail me now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Substitute Insect pulled himself onto the rope and sat on the loop, similar to the makeshift swings he used to play on when he was younger. Once he was balanced and certain he wasn\u2019t going to slip off, Ichigo started to survey the space around him. Escape was his priority and now was as good as a chance as any. He tried to look for a hole or rip in the white fabric he could climb through. After all the destruction he had caused and those bombs, surely his clothes must have suffered somehow. To Ichigo\u2019s surprise, there wasn\u2019t a tear to be found. Whatever had made this kid so big not only increased the resistance of his skin, but also his clothes. The only thing that could harm them now was probably Jinta himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that option gone, Ichigo decided the only way out was to climb out. Climbing up would be a mistake since Jinta would spot him easily, so down was the only way. He\u2019d climb down to the boy\u2019s jeans, descend those, and then hop off next time it was safe. Ichigo thought about climbing down the boy\u2019s body, but quickly dismissed that idea with a quick feel of the boy\u2019s chest. It was way too hard to grip and its sweaty surface would bring about an uncontrollable slide down. Ichigo finally decided to climb down the shirt instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReadying himself, Ichigo jumped toward the infinite whiteness in front of him and grabbed handfuls of the cotton. Hoping Jinta didn\u2019t notice the loss of weight around his neck, Ichigo started the slow climb down the long expanse of the young giant\u2019s shirt. Every now and then the wind would push Jinta\u2019s shirt against his skin and brush Ichigo against the god\u2019s torso, covering him in more sweat and musk. The Soul Reaper tried to ignore it and focused on reaching the boy\u2019s pants. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly, very slowly, Ichigo was making his way down the inside of the titan's shirt. It was harder going than he had expected and he was starting to get tired. But thoughts of what would happen to him if Jinta caught him trying to escape gave him renewed stamina and he kept going. There were a couple of scare points when his sweaty grip weakened and he slid down the shirt before getting a good grip again, and another when he was slammed against Jinta's belly and he nearly stuck to it thanks to all the sweat on both bodies. Luckily he had persevered. The pants were getting closer and closer. Within a few minutes he would be clinging to the boy's jean shorts waistband. From there it would be a short trip to the bottom of the shorts and from there just a heart stopping slid down the boy's leg before reaching the foot. Once he was back on solid ground he was heading immediately to find Rukia so they could get in contact with the Soul Society for some much needed assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut luck had finally run out for Ichigo. Halfway down the stomach, when he was only a short climb to the waistband, a particularly strong gust of wind plastered Jinta's shirt against his stomach. This would have just been a time like any other except for the fact that Ichigo was positioned directly in front of the mountainous boy's navel. Before he knew what was happening he was crammed inside it. He went in butt first, his back bending him almost totally in half, a supremely uncomfortable position. With a little maneuvering he managed to get onto his side, curled up in a ball with his legs over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! I was so close!\" Ichigo cursed, trying to wiggle free from his new prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Ichigo was well stuck thanks to the relatively small size of the navel, Ichigo's current position, and the sweat actively gluing him in place. The only good thing Ichigo could think about this was, if Jinta saw that he escaped but got crammed into his navel, Jinta would find the whole situation hilarious. Which was rather like choosing your method of execution. Either way, no one but the guy in charge is getting a good deal. Suddenly a dark rumbling sound surrounded Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell was that?\" Ichigo wondered trying to look around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a massive hand patted the stomach, rubbing it slightly. \"Looks like I'm hungry little man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence as though Jinta was waiting for a response of some kind. \"Finally learned your place, huh, buggy boy? Well that suits me fine. Maybe if you keep playing nice I'll let you out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo knew that he had to get out of here before that happened or he would be back in the giant's clutches. But what could he do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All this playing had gotten Jinta hungry. At times like this, he would usually steal some money from Ururu and go buy a big burger and some ice cream. Now, however, a burger and ice cream wouldn\u2019t be enough to satisfy him by themselves. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t have to worry about money! The entire town would supply him with his meal. Looking around, Jinta spotted a popular bakery shop and decided to start there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet.\u201c the giant roared, pun not intended. The hungry giant stomped over the building, grabbed the edges of its roof, and easily ripped it off. Tossing the mass behind him, Jinta bent down and got a closer look at the inside. Any customers or employers inside stared up at the boy in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard you were having a special today. \u2018Give All Your Food To God Jinta\u2019 Day!\u201d Jinta snickered as he lowered one of his enormous hands into the shop. Everyone screamed and rushed for the exits. Jinta ignored them and fixed his attention on the many racks of donuts, bagels, cakes, and bread. He gripped one of the racks and tore it off the wall. The rack of food was brought up to Jinta\u2019s mouth as his lips parted to allow all the sweets to be deposited inside. Jinta moaned as he chewed the serving, getting a mouthful of flavor. After swallowing, he moved onto another rack and did the same. When all the racks were empty, the giant\u2019s lips were coated in sugar, but his stomach still wasn\u2019t satisfied. The red-haired kid tore into the back of the shop to find several boxes full of more treats, which he happily gulped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ichigo listened to the giant above as he ate. He hoped it wasn\u2019t people he was enjoying, and the lack of screams told him it wasn\u2019t. That didn\u2019t matter, though. He had to get out of here fast before Jinta found him. He struggled to pull himself out, but Jinta\u2019s navel refused to let him go. He started to pant loudly as any hope of escape seemed to go up in smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026just calm down, Kurosaki.\u201d Ichigo muttered to himself as he tried to regain control of his breathing. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in a lot of tight situations before. There\u2019s always a way out\u2026just think!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo squeezed his eyes shut as his mind worked fiercely to come up with a solution. He tried to ignore the sounds of Jinta gorging himself, because it wasn\u2019t helping. A light bulb suddenly lit up in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on a sec!\u201d Ichigo shouted to himself. The high-school student used one of his hands to dig into his left pocket. Nothing. He tried his right. Eureka, his cell phone! Ichigo grabbed it tightly in his fist and brought it up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI completely forgot I had this! Why didn\u2019t I think of this sooner! So stupid!\u201d Ichigo cursed himself, but didn\u2019t spent much time on it. Resolving is present situation was the only thing he had to worry about. He\u2019d just call Rukia and get her to send Soul Society to help him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the shirt, Jinta had finished putting the bakery shop out of business and stomped over it, crushing it into the ground. In front of him was a fast food joint, which he greedily tore into to continue his feast. Inside he found heaps of fries and burgers which he scooped up. In the back he also spotted a canister of cola. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect, I was getting thirsty.\u201d Jinta tore the canister from the floor, ripped its top open, and began chugging it down. When he was done, he clenched the canister in his fist and crushed it into a ball before throwing it over his shoulder. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo had managed to dial about three numbers when a huge groaning sound filled the area directly to the right of him, deep within Jinta's belly. He stopped for a second and listened as the groaning growling sound made its way up through Jinta's body until it filled his mouth. Jinta smacked his lips a few times before opening his mouth wide to allow the belch to rip its way out of the bowels of his body. The force of the burp was so great that Ichigo could feel it vibrating through his whole body. Before he knew what was happening his cellphone vibrated right out of his grip and fell towards the ground. Ichigo watched in horror as he saw the small electronic object flip slowly end over end until it disappeared from his view. No matter where it landed it could no longer help him. This was the last straw. Ichigo's blank stare of horror changed into a look of pure rage. Next thing he knew he was throwing a world class fit. Forcing his body left and right, waving his arms as much as he could, kicking what he could reach, Ichigo let loose a steady stream of curses until he was completely out of breath. His last hope was now smashed on the ground. His last hope was that Urahara returned soon or Rukia became aware of the danger and realized he was incapacitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the navel Jinta was looking curiously down at his stomach. After he had burped he could have sworn he felt a weird tickling sensation in his belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? A bug or some...thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta instantly plunged his hand down the front of his shirt and grabbed the rope that was supposed to be tying down his bug buddy. He pulled the rope out and was shocked to see it empty. Jinta stomped over to the nearest building he could find and dropped to his knees. The windows were extremely reflective, like a giant mirror. Lifting up his shirt Jinta looked around his navel and just managed to see Ichigo crammed in there. He snorted a little before bursting out in gales of laughter. This was all too much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well bug. Looks like you tried to escape and got stuck. That's just fine with me. You can finish your punishment in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Ichigo had an idea. \"No wait! Don't leave me in here! I'm sorry for what I said!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta stopped lowering his shirt and said, \"What was that insect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo gritted his teeth at the insult and replied, \"I said I'm sorry! Don't keep me in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta grinned wickedly and said, \"Aw, that's cute. You're begging me for forgiveness! I suppose I can be forgiving just this once. Next time though you might find yourself inside my belly instead of just stuck in it so don't mouth off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta lowered his fingers to his navel and started pressing around the edge of it. It took a few seconds but Ichigo eventually popped out into Jinta's waiting fingers. Jinta raised his palm to his face and said, \"Don't get your hopes up too high slave. I'm still tying you back up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo had seen this coming. But at least he wasn't trapped inside a sweaty hell with the danger of suffocation. Jinta grabbed the loop of rope in his other hand and set Ichigo down on top of a nearby building, using his palm as a backdrop to prevent Ichigo from running. He grabbed the rope in both hands and started wrapping them around Ichigo. Soon, Ichigo was bound like a caterpillar in a cocoon with a long strand of it coming off his back. Jinta tied this long strand into a loop and raised it up to his ear. He fit the loop around his ear and tightened it until Ichigo was swinging a few, relative, inches below the earlobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go! You made a crappy necklace so lets see how you do as a earring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo sighed as he swayed in the wind. So much for his great escape...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Right after Jinta had secured Ichigo\u2019s new position as his new earring, he felt something hit the back of his head. It felt like a pebble\u2026no, more like a spitball. Jinta turned around to see a tank pointing its turret gun at him. A few more tanks appeared around him, as well as a few helicopters. These copters were equip with machine guns. Finally, a couple jets zoomed by his head. All this resistance just brought a smirk to the young boy\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, they\u2019re bringing out the big guns now, eh? Bring it on!\u201d Jinta shouted as he smacked his fist into his palm. One of the officers on the ground received the green light and commanded all personnel to open fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked around at the army and sighed. He hoped they\u2019d be effective, but knew in the back of is mind they were all doomed. Suddenly, he realized something. Jinta was immune to bombshells, but not him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!! Don\u2019t shoot!!\u201d the Substitute Soul Reaper cried.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late. The next few moments were filled with the sound of tanks unleashing a barrage of bombshells, jets shooting homing missiles, and helicopters firing their machine guns into the smoke created form the explosions. The attack lasted a full minute before the commander gave the order to cease fire. All the units were left in silence as the space Jinta was occupying was covered in smoke and dust. Slowly the veil began to lift as the soldiers began to make out the shape of the giant boy still standing with one of his arms placed on his hip. The boy was completely unhurt, not even a scratch on his face. His other hand had covered his ear, making sure Ichigo survived the assault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it? That was a load of crap! You\u2019re supposed to be shooting bullets, not flower petals!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-did you just save me?\u201d Ichigo asked, sort of surprised. Jinta gave him an evil look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make it sound so goody-goody, bug boy. If anyone\u2019s going to end your puny life, it\u2019ll be me! Don\u2019t think for a minute I care about you at all!\u201d Jinta scolded his little toy before turning his attention back to the army. \u201cI guess it\u2019s my turn to go all out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta started by running toward a group of tanks. He jumped high into the air and landed with a boom, one tank under each foot. With two tanks crushed flat, he grabbed another one by its main gun and lifted it into the air. Another tank tried using this opportunity to shoot him, but the shells didn\u2019t even leave a burn mark. Jinta raised the tank over his head and slammed it down on the attacking one like a hammer. Both exploded upon impact. The giant red head directed his attention to the helicopters that were shooting the back of his head. He grabbed both of them in either hand and smashed them together. They fell back down to earth as a single, burning heap of junk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta saw the jets speeding toward him and was prepared. They both split, one heading toward his legs while the other toward his face. The one below tried to fire some heat-seeking rockets at the giant and then escape through the boy\u2019s legs. The rockets bounced off his skin like everything else and the jet was dealt with when Jinta squeezed his legs together just as the jet passed by them. The aircraft and its pilot were crushed by Jinta\u2019s mega sized thighs. The remaining jet passed over Jinta\u2019s head and sped off into the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you fly away! None of your army toys can stop me!\u201d Jinta shouted at the fleeing jet. The rest of the attacking force also began their retreat. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta dusted his hands off after another job well done. His toy was still safe and he had shown the world just what he was capable off. Truly nothing could stop him. He flicked Ichigo and said, \"Lucky for you your god is so powerful little slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo wanted so badly to bite that damn flicking finger but couldn't reach it. It was all futile anyway. All Jinta would feel was...nothing. Explosives, missiles, tanks, jets, helicopters, bullets, everything that the police and army could offer were totally useless against the massive boy. The only think left to try would be a full on nuclear strike and that might not do anything. It was risk that Ichigo prayed would be too great to attempt. Jinta may be able to protect him from explosions but radiation would be a whole other story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jinta surveyed the ruined debris that was once Karakura Town he felt a deep sense of satisfaction. In just a few short hours he had accomplished so much. He was actually surprised that the Soul Reapers hadn't got wind of him yet. Wasn't it there job to protect the world of the living. A sudden thought came to Jinta that made him puff out his chest slightly. They were obviously just too scared to come after him. After all, he had one of their own swinging from his ear. What hope did they have? Pride swelled up inside Jinta filling him with confidence and...wait a minute, what was going on? Jinta felt a swelling sense of satisfaction but that wasn't the only thing that was swelling. Looking around at the few still standing buildings he saw them getting smaller. He quickly slammed his foot down next to one and grinned when he confirmed what was going on. He was steadily growing even bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo noticed it as well. The rope started creaking and groaning as Jinta's ear grew too big for it to loop around. Slowly it cut into his skin, deeper and deeper, stretching further and further until the rope snapped sending the still cocooned Ichigo down onto Jinta's shoulder. He bounced a few times before rolling down the shoulder and off into the great abyss of open air. As he fell face first towards the ground Ichigo was, for once, relieved to see Jinta's gigantic palm appear in his line of sight. He landed safely on the soft, slightly sweaty boy flesh and rolled over onto his back. He could feel the hand shifting under his body as Jinta continued to grow larger. The giant red head brought his palm up to his face and Jinta winked at Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a feeling you'd be falling off of their once I started growing. You're just getting way too small to be taken care of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta's voice rolled through the air like thunder. Ichigo gritted his teeth as he gazed up at the still growing behemoth. If he got much smaller, in comparison, Jinta would lose interest in him. The harder he was to see, the more pointless his existence became in the eyes of the boy. Ichigo closed his eyes and prayed silently, not something he normally did, that Jinta would stop growing soon. When he opened his eyes it seemed his prayers had been answered. Jinta's fingers were no longer stretching up further and further into the sky, his face wasn't stretching wider and taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Jinta had stopped growing he was still a sight to behold. The giant boy's growing feet had demolished even more buildings, the streets cracking under his great weight. Every shift of his feet caused slight tremors to shake the ground. The tallest buildings in the city were under his knees. Well...they would have been if they weren't currently piles of rubble. Jinta had become a tower of a boy, his form now easily visible for miles in either direction. If Ichigo had been standing in front of his feet he would have been a quarter the size of his big toe. He was even more of a bug in Jinta's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ichigo came to these revelations Jinta was scanning the tiny teen's body. He was much smaller now and far more fragile. Any wrong movement could cause him to be crushed. While Jinta liked the idea of having even more power over his slave he didn't want him dead. Not unless he disobeyed him fully. But at his size it would be difficult not to accidentally crush him. Jinta just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. I guess I'll just have to be careful not to smash you by accident carrot top. Now I gotta find a better place to store you though, since you broke my rope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo didn't rise to the bait. He kept silent and waited to see what Jinta had in store for him.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, I still have another great place for you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-where?\u201d Ichigo asked in a slightly scared tone. Jinta answered him with a smirk, which wasn\u2019t comforting to the small bug. Jinta started to move his hand downward, which caused Ichigo to lose is balance easily and fall onto his side. Once Jinta\u2019s hand stopped and Ichigo had regained his stature, he looked toward Jinta to see that he was staring right at the boy\u2019s crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you-?\u201d Ichigo began to ask until he witnessed the boy\u2019s other hand pulling the front of his pants open. Ichigo didn\u2019t know he could open his eyes this wide. \u201cNo way! Don\u2019t even think about putting me in your-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta ignored the bug\u2019s disapproval as he stretched the elastic band of his pants and underwear. In a simple motion, the boy turned his palm over and dropped his plaything into his pants. Ichigo could have sworn he fell for miles, screaming the entire time. Eventually he hit something soft and bounced on it a few times. Ichigo frantically looked around. The air was even muskier than inside Jinta\u2019s shirt. He looked down at what he had fallen on and tried to tell himself it was something else. However, its pulsing movement and overall appearance told him otherwise: it was Jinta\u2019s flaccid dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God\u2026\u201d Ichigo mumbled, almost breaking down. This was the ultimate form of humiliation. The Soul Reaper looked back up at Jinta\u2019s grinning face and shouted. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave me in here! Anywhere but here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s either there or in the back, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll take much for you to become a little red stain on my bottom. Just stay there and keep quiet. Who knows, maybe you\u2018ll get some company later.\u201d Jinta finished talking with the inferior boy and snapped his pants back in place. Ichigo couldn\u2019t see much in the hot atmosphere of Jinta\u2019s pants, since his blue pants filtered in a lot less light. The teenager just fell limp upon his god\u2019s member. He silently wished Jinta would just crush him and put him out of his misery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Jinta had put Ichigo in his place. It time to go back to doing what he did best: creating chaos in the town. He looked down to see most of the buildings destroyed, and the few remaining small ones barely making it past his ankle. Jinta lifted his bare foot over a block of small homes and slowly brought it down. He could feel everything under his sole compress until they were all smashed deep within the earth. Removing his foot, all Jinta could see was a large footprint where the houses once stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt this rate there won\u2019t be a town to destroy!\u201d Jinta bellowed as he looked around. A full evacuation of the town was in progress. Cars were desperately trying to squeeze through the roads. Several accidents had already occurred. Many people had fled their cars and were escaping on foot. Karakura Town was a big town, though, so evacuating everyone was not an easy task. Some of the town may even be oblivious to Jinta\u2019s rampage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026I wonder what\u2019s over there.\u201d Jinta pondered as he started to walk carelessly in the direction he was looking. He had grown so big that he lo longer recognized the town below him, so he had no idea where he was going. He just let his feet take him wherever. With his new growth, his feet no longer crashed through buildings, but instead stepped on them completely. A trail of giant foot prints were left behind as Jinta made his way to\u2026 </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta decided to leave the rest of the town for later. He had been on his feet all day and he needed some time to himself...with his slave of course. He patted his crotch with a grin as he imagined what kind of time Ichigo was having in there. But there would be plenty of time to play with his toy. Scanning the horizon Jinta spotted a familiar location: the beach. He had been there a few times when he was able to escape from Urahara's store. He distinctly remembered Ururu trying to build sand castles while he stomped all over them. His rampage around town was a lot like his beach vacations just with more collateral damage and death. But that was neither here nor there. Stomping towards the sand he reached the beach in under a minute. He wiggled his toes in the warm sand, the ground shaking even under this slight pressure. The salt air penetrated the giant's nose and he sighed with his eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, this is the life! I haven't been to the beach in a long time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off his shirt and tossed into over some rubble, not aware that he covered up a few dozen escaping cars who got their tires caught up in the massive fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, this beach is a lot smaller than I remembered it.\" Jinta smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding with his heels at the road his toes reached the shallows of the ocean, his feet filling the gap on what is quite a sizable beach. To normal people anyway. Still, he wanted to soak his feet so he walked into the water until it was up to his ankles. It was colder than he thought it would be, goosebumps erupting over his flesh. When he was used to it he walked in further until the water was up to his knees. A few seconds later he walked in more until the water was just under his crotch. Jinta stared down at his pants for a second and thought about Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" he thought to himself. \"I wonder if carrot top will slip out if I put him under water...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jinta ruminated Ichigo himself was sitting atop of the giant penis. He had managed to wiggle out of the ropes that had been binding him and was now sitting cross legged. He sighed as he looked around his prison. It was hot, it was musky, and it smelled like human body. Not to mention there was a thicket of red hair at his back. If he moved too far down to the base of the dick he knew he would get tangled rather easily. He made a mental note to avoid moving in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ichigo felt his bottom get soaked. Jumping up at the cold feeling of the water, Ichigo saw that water seemed to be rising up all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that brat doing now?\" Ichigo muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis question was to go unanswered as the water continued rising. Soon, it was up to Ichigo's chest. If Jinta didn't stop moving his toy would be completely submerged. Jinta just kept going into deeper water and eventually Ichigo was treading water. Unfortunately, because of this, Jinta's body continued moving forward while his stayed still. Ichigo swam as fast as he could, trying, in vain, to stay away from the giant boy. This was it! This was his chance to escape, to swim to safety! If only he could just...stay...swimming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most of Ichigo's ventures today, this one was also destined to end in failure. Jinta's body soon caught up to Ichigo. The water was around the middle of Jinta's stomach so Ichigo once again found himself being drawn into the boy's navel. The water flowed into the cave like hole and Ichigo flowed in with it. The navel was far bigger than the last time Ichigo had been inside. Instead of being a horribly cramped space it was like the living room in Ichigo's house. Plenty of room to sit, stand, or relax in. Ichigo knew he wasn't going to be spending much time in here again though. The water would eventually flow out and he would be able to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would have been the case if Jinta hadn't decided to float on his back. This left Ichigo in a water filled pit. The water was quite shallow though. It only came up to Ichigo's knees. However, the pit itself was deep enough that Ichigo couldn't climb out. The smooth walls of the navel also made it impossible to escape. Ichigo flopped back down on his butt and leaned against the \"wall\". There was nothing he could do until Jinta let him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta stared at the young Soul Reaper as he thought about where to put him. His bellybutton would make a good place. There was probably a lot more room for his little bug since his growth. As Jinta continued to lock eyes with Ichigo, he felt something odd. Looking down at himself, he noticed a strange snake-like thing with red mane enwrapped around his waist. It was slowly squeezing him, but only left Jinta with an annoyed expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hell?\u201d Jinta mumbled. Suddenly, a certain red-haired Soul Reaper flash stepped onto Jinta\u2019s open palm, grabbed Ichigo, and flash stepped onto a nearby building. Jinta noticed too late and glared at the figure. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing with my plaything, moocher!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji ignored the giant brat and tossed Ichigo on top of the building roughly. The Vice-Captain grinned at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you seriously having trouble with this brat, Ichigo? That\u2019s just sad.\u201d Renji joked as he continued to entangle Jinta with his Bankai.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you calling a brat, moocher!?\u201d Jinta\u2019s eye twitched as he started to stomp over to Renji. Before he got any closer, something tripped him and made him fall on top of several other buildings, crushing them all under his humongous form. Jinta\u2019s feet had been tangled up in a bunch of orange tendrils. Several Soul Reapers appeared and surrounded the giant. Some of them were the casters of the Bakudo spell, while others prepared their swords. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou little insects!! You\u2019re really starting to annoy me! I\u2019m going to squash every last one of you!\u201d Jinta sneered as he tried to push himself off the ground. A cold sensation quickly covered his hands as he found them frozen in place. \u201cOh, geez!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white-haired Captain appeared next to Ichigo, his Zanpakuto unsheathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToshiro!\u201d Ichigo said in surprise, earning an angry look from the boyish Captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you a million times, it\u2019s Captain Hitsugaya!\u201d the ice Soul Reaper shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026anyway, what took you do long?! You won\u2019t believe what I\u2019ve been through!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known about the situation for awhile now, but Captain Kurotsuchi insisted we do nothing until he\u2019s gather some data. We were finally able to send a small part out.\u201d Renji explained. None of is surprised the teen at all. That sounded just like Mayuri; sacrificing countless people just so he could collect some interesting data. \u201cAnyway, we have this brat contained. That Urahara has a lot of explaining to do, though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Contained? Think again!\u201d the giant kid bellowed as he pulled on his hands with all his might. They were quickly free as the ice around them shattered into thousands of pieces. Hitsugaya was left in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d muttered the 10th Squad Captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta started to pick himself up. The Kido spells around his legs started to strain as they slowly started to snap one-by-one. Finally, as Jinta stood up, he used one hand to grab Renji\u2019s Hihio Zabimaru and easily ripped it off his waist. Renji just grunted and pulled back on Zabimaru\u2019s tail, reforming the Bankai even after it was shattered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod\u2019s of Death, eh?\u201d Jinta said as he stood up to his full height and gave the Soul Reapers on the ground a feral smile. \u201cI\u2019ll show you who\u2019s the god of death, bugs!\u201d The giant boy lifted his foot and started stomping the little insects. The Soul Reapers just barely managed to dodge, but Jinta wasn\u2019t letting up as he continued to play Stomp-the-Insect with the petty men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamnit, this\u2019ll be tougher than we thought!\u201d Toshiro cursed. The short Captain was about to jump into the fray, but glanced over at Ichigo. \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Go into your spirit form and help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026I can\u2019t. He took my Seal of Approval.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, figures\u2026\u201d Hitsugaya mumbled as he dug into is kosode and took something out, which he threw to Ichigo. \u201cUse that.\u201d The young-looking boy then jumped off the roof toward Jinta, along with Renji. Hitsugaya swung his sword down and shot an ice dragon at Jinta, which incased the boy\u2019s left arm in ice. Jinta didn\u2019t seem fazed as he gave the arm a flex, shattering the ice in the progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ichigo was staring at the thing in his hand. It was Hitsugaya\u2019s Soul Candy dispenser, complete with its childish-looking appearance, Despite that. it may be his last glint of hope and chance to combat Jinta. But\u2026was that such a good idea? Even with the combined might of himself, the 10th Squad Captain, the 6th Squad Vice-Captain, and a bunch of minor Soul Reapers\u2026was victory possible? They didn\u2019t see up close the amount of damage Jinta could do. Plus, if they failed and Ichigo was once again in the giant kid\u2019s clutches, it was highly unlikely he would forgive this act of disobedience. He may as well sign his own death certificate! Maybe he should just sit this one out\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Then again, if he didn\u2019t help and somehow Soul Society DID manage to defeat Jinta, he\u2019d be the laughing stock for years to come. They may never trust him the same way again. They\u2019ll call him a coward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon of a-! It shouldn\u2019t be this hard to make up my mind!\u201d Ichigo told himself as he clawed at his scalp. \u201cWhat has this brat done to me?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I'd rather be dead than a humiliated slave! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that proclamation Ichigo popped the Soul Candy into his mouth and burst into his Soul Reaper form, his body once again falling limp on the roof before jumping back up and watching the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo quickly activated his Bankai and flash stepped towards Jinta, slashing his arm with his black blade. The sword clanged off of Jinta's hard skin, not even making a scratch. Jinta felt the blow and narrowed his eyes at his slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biggest mistake of your life carrot top! When I catch you you're going to get it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo tightened his grip on his sword and tried attacking a different area, this time the face. He specifically aimed for the eyes but Jinta was one step ahead of him and swatted him with his hand. Hitsugaya took this opportunity to fire off another ice dragon that encased Jinta's arm. Renji quickly wrapped Zabimaru around the other arm and Ichigo moved in for a strike. As Ichigo approached Jinta managed to shatter the ice holding his arm but was too late to stop Ichigo stabbing him in the cheek. The sword actually managed to penetrate the soft skin flesh drawing blood for the first time from Jinta. Jinta blew at Ichigo who was sent rocketing backward in the hurricane like winds. Jinta rubbed the blood off his cheek and shook off Zabimaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now you bugs are starting to make me angry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta took a step forward only to find his feet bound to the ground. The Soul Reapers on the ground had managed a binding spell on Jinta's massive bare feet. Jinta growled in frustration as Hitsugaya aimed yet another ice dragon at Jinta's eye. Jinta, not paying attention to the white haired Soul Reaper, felt the icy sting in his right eye. He yelled out and rubbed his eye trying to get the shards out of it. He wasn't permanently blinded but it still stung. Renji aimed for the other eye and unleashed Zabimaru, the bone snake jabbing the left eye before Jinta could stop him. With both eyes blinded and his feet bound Jinta was roaring in frustration, trying to free himself and clear his eyes at the same time. Ichigo took this opportunity to aim a Getsuga Tensho at his face. The blue energy sliced deep into Jinta's cheek blood flying out and striking the nearby buildings. That was the last straw for Jinta. With an almighty wrenching of his feet the binding spells were broken, Jinta's massive feet taking out a handful of Soul Reapers. With his left eyes recovering faster than his right he managed to see three blurry shapes floating in front of him. He reached out and smacked all three of them with his fist, sending one of them flying into a building and the other two smashing into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say your prayers whoever you are!\" Jinta growled as he raised his foot above the two prone bodies embedded in the concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought his massive foot down, crushing the two Soul Reapers completely. They had been doing so well, but a stray moment of letting their guard down had killed them in the end. Jinta turned his attention on the group of Soul Reapers on the ground all of whom were visibly shaking in fear at the giant boy before them. Jinta reached down and grabbed as many of them in his hands as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fighting you guys really worked up an appetite. Down the hatch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth wide and dumped the Soul Reapers into the sticky, humid cave. He didn't bother to chew such tiny morsels. A few gulps was all it took to send them to their doom. Jinta sighed and patted his belly, now turning his full attention on the Soul Reaper that had gotten knocked into a building. By this time Jinta's eyes were healed again and he was ready to punish someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if carrot top was the one who survived. He's pretty much broken in, except for his occasional bursts of idiotic posturing. But maybe the moocher or the kid would be more fun. Eh, either way I still have a slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind Jinta walked over to the building and pulled down the front of it. Once he could see inside he reached in and pulled out the prone figure of a Soul Reaper. But who had survived?</span></div></div>",

Blood was seeping out of a wound on his head and Jinta could only imagine how bruised the Soul Reaper must be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, carrot top, wake up.\u201d Jinta commanded as he shook the teen in is fist. Ichigo cried out in pain before coming to and looking around in confusion. Zangetsu wasn\u2019t in is hand anymore; probably still in the building somewhere. The orange-haired swordsman didn\u2019t remember much of what happened. One moment he was fighting Jinta, the next he was spiraling face-first into a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what happened? Where\u2019s Renji and Toshiro?\u201d Ichigo asked, mostly to himself. Nevertheless, Jinta answered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, those guys? I crushed them like bugs! I couldn\u2019t see well, but it must have been them since you\u2019re still kicking. And you know what, bug boy? It\u2018s your fault! If you hadn\u2018t raised your sword against me, I probably wouldn\u2018t have had such a hard time and could have just captured them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo gasped in shock. They were\u2026dead? It was his fault? Oh God\u2026when Rukia hears she\u2019ll\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn you to hell.\u201d Ichigo muttered as tears started to form in his eyes. He\u2019d foolishly tried to raise his blade against the giant and got his friends killed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t look do angry. As long as people insist on disobeying me, they\u2019ll keep dying or, if they\u2019re smart, become my slaves. You should start worrying about yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026just hurry up and kill me.\u201d Ichigo grumbled, dropping his head in defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should do that. After all, you actually hurt me a few times back there. I can\u2019t forgive that.\u201d Jinta said as he brought his other hand to caress his cheek. Ichigo silently waited for his doom. Would he be crushed like his comrades? Eaten and made into the boy\u2019s food? \u201cHowever, I\u2019m not going to kill you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! Why?!\u201d the Substitute Soul Reaper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just too much fun to torture. You\u2019re more trouble that your worth, but its nothing I can\u2019t deal with. I think I\u2019ll keep you around for as long as possible and let you bear witness to the reign of God Jinta.\u201d Jinta brought the small teen close to his face and grinned insanely. \u201cOr I might accidentally just smash you. I won\u2019t be looking out for you all the time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta looked around for a moment before spotting something on top of a nearby building. Jinta reached his hand toward it and grabbed Ichigo\u2019s human body (currently inhabited by the artificial soul) and brought both the orange heads to his face. He gave the human body a nice squeeze and forced the soul candy out of it. With one quick movement Jinta slammed Ichigo into his human body, forcing the two to bond once again. The sudden rush left Ichigo with a sense of vertigo and he held his head in pain. The rest of his body also hurt a bit from is injuries sustained while in his sprit form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s the end of that, though. That act of hostility deserves a severe punishment, and I know just the thing!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta sat down and took off his shirt, tossing it aside for now before lying on his back. He dropped the bruised and battered Ichigo onto his chest and put his hands behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up slave because I'm only going to say this once. I'm going to tell you to do something that will break you. You will finally lose all your stubborn attitudes and serve me like a god deserves to be served. Your first task is to clean my body...using only your tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's jaw dropped at hearing this. Not only was he wincing in pain at every movement thanks to his failed attempts to free himself, not only was his mind trying to cope with the guilt of being responsible for the deaths of Renji, Toshiro, and an entire platoon of Soul Reapers, but now he was expected to clean the expanse of Jinta's body with only his tongue? That didn't even sound possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you'll do it alright bug boy. And you'd better be quick about it. Imagine if I were to start growing again. There would be even more area to cover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo didn't like the sound of that at all. The bigger Jinta got, the less he would pay attention to Ichigo. The second Jinta lost interest in him was the second that Ichigo's life was forfeit. He almost felt like he deserved it and was sure that Jinta was of the same mind. It was either an extreme stroke of good luck that he wasn't dead or a cruel twist of fate that kept him in this endless torture. Ichigo gazed over the length of Jinta's body. He was currently between the boy's nipples with his immense head looming in one direction and a seemingly endless plain of flesh in the other. Ichigo fell to his knees, stuck out his tongue, and pressed it against the boy's skin. Jinta could just barely feel the tiny tongue. He wasn't doing this for the feeling of the cleaning however. This was meant to be a lesson to Ichigo. Plus he was getting excited by the sheer amount of control he had. It never ceased to amuse him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo dragged his tongue slowly over Jinta's chest, the taste of salt heavy in his mouth. Jinta had worked up a bit of a sweat during the fight making his skin slick and somewhat slimy to the taste. Ichigo kept his gag reflex in check however. If Jinta found even a tiny splatter of vomit on his skin that would probably be the straw that broke the camel's back. So he moved slowly keeping his mind purely on other things. His situation just kept getting worse and worse. No matter what he tried or what happened he seemed to end up losing something whether it be his friends or his dignity. Would the Soul Society risk sending out other Soul Reapers to take care of Jinta? Would they do something else to stop the giant? Ichigo remembered they had a Kido Cannon at their disposal which might have a better chance of harming Jinta. But that could also cause damage to the Living World. Perhaps if they sent all the current Captains and Lieutenants they would be able to subdue Jinta. Of course, this was all assuming Jinta didn't grow even bigger and become even more resilient. No, the best chance they had was getting Urahara to come back. He would know what Jinta got into and how it could be reversed. Just where did he go? If he was gone for weeks it would all be too late. Jinta would be unstoppable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo was so deep in thought he didn't even notice when he bumped into something. Looking up, his tongue already sore and dry from all the licking, he saw that he was in front of one of Jinta's nipples. It was a rather impressive sight, rising high above Ichigo like a miniature mountain. He was about to move around it when Jinta boomed, \"Oh no you don't! When I told you to clean my body I meant every last thing on my body! Get licking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo sighed and stuck his tongue to the nipple. The texture and taste was slightly different from the rest of Jinta's chest. Ichigo licked all around the base of the nipple before beginning his ascent of it. He planned to lick up one side of it, then down one side before heading to the third side and licking up that and ending by licking down the last side. He would repeat this process with the other nipple and then head down towards the belly button. Ichigo briefly wondered if he would be expected to lick inside of that as well and decided not to think about it. That bridge would eventually come and he would cross it then. In the meantime, it was back to licking.</span></div></div>",

Mayuri was typing furiously at his control panel while the screens in front of him lit up with charts and data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is amazing!\u201d The 12th Division Captain cried as he went over the energy levels. \u201cThis being used to be a simple human child with above average spiritual pressure, but as since become something much more! His spiritual energy is higher than anything I have recorded in my database!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026are you saying it\u2019s more powerful than anything we\u2019ve encountered before?\u201c Hisagi asked, who had been standing behind the Captain this entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect, 9th Squad Lieutenant.\u201d Mayuri responded as he continued to type. \u201cHowever, I regret to say that I haven\u2019t had the pleasure in collecting complete data on certain individuals, such as the Captain-Commander or Aizen. However, the bigger this boy gets\u2026the greater the chance his power will dwarf even those two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThan we must do something! If the situation continues like this, it could escalate into world-wide terror. The entire Human World will be in danger. Even Soul Society could be at risk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPreposterous! Soul Society is a world completely made up of spiritual particles! No matter how big he gets, he is still just a human. Accessing Soul Society would be impossible\u2026\u201d Mayuri explained, although a thought still lingered in the back of his sick, twisted mind. What if Jinta becomes so powerful that even the laws of the world cannot restrict him?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cStill, we\u2019re relying on you for a solution, 12th Squad Captain.\u201d spoke Shunsui, who was also waiting behind the demented Captain. \u201cYama-jii has already suggested using the Kido Cannon if all else fails, and even that may not be enough if this kid gets any bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m aware of that. I\u2019ve already come up with a solution. It\u2019ll take a day or two, but I can use this data to create a product that\u2019ll reverse the growth effects the subject is undergoing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just locate Kisuke Urahara? If this is his mess, surely he\u2019ll know of a way to--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I refuse to ask that exiled Soul Reaper for assistance. I will handle this myself; leave so I can concentrate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. The Human World will continue to suffer while you hold on to your petty grudges.\u201d criticized the 8th Squad Captain as he left with Hisagi. Mayuri just smiled a wicked grin after they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt the same time, I\u2019ll replicate the growth formula itself! If Soul Society possessed the power to enlarge their troops at will, we\u2019d be unstoppable!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back with Ichigo and his giant master, the broken Soul Reaper had just finished licking the boy\u2019s second nipple and was on his way down the stomach. He wasn\u2019t walking, though, but crawling on his hands and knees. As he moved, he trailed his tongue down the boy\u2019s smooth stomach. Ichigo\u2019s poor tongue was completely dry; he need a quick brake. Stopping, Ichigo rested his head against Jinta\u2019s belly and listened to his insides churn. He heard the titan\u2019s stomach juices sloshing around and gurgling. It was\u2026a surprising comforting sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to upset Jinta, Ichigo quickly picked up where he left off and continued to lick Jinta\u2019s abdomen clean. Eventually he had covered all of it\u2026safe for the navel. Would he have to lick there?  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo just stared down into the hole before him. He had been in there once before when it was too small to properly hold him but now it was like a deep pit, one he wouldn't easily be able to climb out of. Did he really have to in there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta raised his head as he felt Ichigo stop moving around and said, \"Hey, what are you doing carrot top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked back and shouted, \"Do I have to lick your belly button too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta rolled his eyes and roared, \"Of course you do you idiot! What part of \"my entire body\" did you not freaking understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ichigo could respond Jinta's massive finger came up behind the tiny teen and shoved him roughly forward. Ichigo instantly fell into the hole, turning over a few times before landing on his back at the bottom of the navel. He slowly got to his feet and looked around him. The top of the navel was quite a ways up and the walls were completely smooth. He wasn't getting out of here without Jinta's help. The slightly comforting sounds of Jinta's stomach was amplified in here. But that was beside the point right now. He stuck his protesting tongue out and started with the \"ground\". The taste was once again different, salty with bits of lint and some particles of dirt that would be invisible to Jinta's gigantic eyes. Once he was threw with that he moved on to the \"walls\". Starting at the base of one side he licked in a circle, on his hands and knees of course, along the circumference of the navel. Once he made a complete lap he moved up and did it again. He repeated this process until he was standing on his tip toes trying to reach up as high as his tongue would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Jinta could feel Ichigo moving around and it felt surprisingly good. He had never realized that his belly button was so sensitive. Jinta was able to perfectly track Ichigo's progress by how he was moving and knew exactly when he stopped. When he hadn't moved for about a minute Jinta growled in frustration and said, \"Keep licking bug boy unless you want me to crush you here and now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo, panicking slightly at the fact that he couldn't continue, shouted as loud as he could, \"I CAN'T REACH ANY MORE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta heard this mighty shout as the squeak of an insect and said, \"Speak up if you want to live carrot top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo took several deep breaths and shouted even louder, \"I CAN'T REACH ANY MORE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Jinta was able to make out the words and he laughed. The laugh reverberated through his body causing his belly to jiggle around, throwing Ichigo for a loop in the navel. When he was finally done laughing he said, \"Alright since you need your god's help, beg for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo slammed one of his hands against the wall of the navel knowing that Jinta wouldn't feel it. Dropping to his knees he took a few more deep breaths and shouted, \"PLEASE HELP ME OUT OF HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta tsked and waved his finger so that Ichigo could see it. \"Ah, ah, ah! That's not right! Say \"I beg you Lord Jinta, my true God and Master, to help get my insignificant body out of your glorious navel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo had lost track of what he was supposed to say halfway through that ridiculous sentence yet knew he wasn't getting out of here without saying it. Trying to keep all the words together in his head he shouted, \"I BEG YOU LORD JINTA, MY TRUE GOD AND MASTER, TO HELP GET MY INSIGNIFICANT BODY OUT OF YOUR GLORIOUS NAVEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing what threat of death could help you remember. Jinta giggled to himself somewhat immaturely and said, \"Well since you asked so nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted his right index finger and probed it slowly into his navel. To Ichigo it was like a death trap in an action movie, like the ceiling was slowly collapsing. Luckily the massive finger tip stopped just short of Ichigo who grabbed onto a hangnail and was lifted out of the belly button. His tiny body was brought before Jinta's face who slowly stood up, showing off his huge form. He lowered Ichigo to the ground, in front of his monumental big toe and shook him off his nail. Ichigo landed heavily on his bottom and stared up and up and up and up to Jinta's face, towering like a god above him. Jinta smirked and crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I released you Substitute Insect. Now thank your god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo dropped to his knees and shouted, \"THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY PRAYER GOD JINTA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to be as flattering as possible, knowing that feeding the kid's humongous ego would help keep him alive. He even bent forward and kissed the toe in front of him. Jinta loved every second of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It finally seems like you're getting the picture carrot top. Keep this up and I might make you a disciple rather than a slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scratched his chin thoughtfully and grinned. \"On second though, forget that. Devoted slaves are a lot more fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta bent over and scooped Ichigo back up bringing him up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your job isn't over yet slave. You finished my torso, now move on to another part. I'll be nice and let you choose one of two options. You can lick clean my godly feet...or get a little more personal, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo knew exactly what he meant. He had dealt with his feet before but Jinta had been on them all day today. They would surely be disgusting, covered in dirt, debris, and sweat. On the other hand...it was the kid's crotch! His dick and balls! It was disturbing enough to just be in his pants, let alone licking his sex organs! As Ichigo pondered Jinta snapped his fingers and said, \"I have an idea! I'll cut you a deal since you've been so good after your little outburst. If you choose the more personal route I'll let you off with only cleaning my torso and junk. All you have to do is submit to me totally. Once you do that, I'll consider you my most loyal slave and bug. It's a better deal than anyone else in this world is going to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo bit his lower lip in thought. It was tempting. But if he totally submitted that would be the last of his willpower, the last of his defiance, the last of his humanity! He would be just Jinta's slave bug. But he was already that! What was the difference? The kid's crotch, that was the difference. But his feet would surely be so filthy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tick tock carrot top! This offer won't last forever! Three seconds left to decide!\"</span></div></div>",

I couldn\u2019t hear you.\u201d Jinta said after he heard his little slave squeak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe personal route!\u201d Ichigo said louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill can\u2019t hear you!\u201d Jinta sang in a mocking voice. He watched as Ichigo dropped to his hands and knees while bowing his head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPLEASE LET ME LICK YOUR SUPERIOR COCK AND BALLS, LORD JINTA! IT WOULD BE AN HONOR!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, bug. I accept your offer.\u201d Jinta smirked as he snatched up the small Soul Reaper between his thumb and index finger and brought him to his waist. With is other hand, he opened up the waistband of his jeans and underwear and dropped his slave inside. Ichigo fell for what seemed like miles until he hit the bottom of the white briefs. At the same time, Jinta closed his pants and sat down against a half-destroyed building. He began to slowly pull his pants down to his ankles, leaving him in only his underwear. This allowed more light to filter through his briefs. He didn\u2019t want carrot top getting stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo gazed in astonishment at the sight before him. He was standing in front of one of Jinta\u2019s giant balls. It was so much bigger than him; it could probably crush him if he slipped underneath it. Above the balls were some patches of red hair that Ichigo could just barely make out. Other than that, Jinta was completely hairless. Sticking out of the crimson hair was a gigantic, looming object that hung above Ichigo motionlessly: Jinta\u2019s penis. He had to lick all of this, so he better get started. Ichigo began by climbing the boy\u2019s balls, licking any \u201cground\u201d he covered. Jinta, unlike when the bug licked his chest, could feel everything. His junk was even more sensitive than his navel. He closed his eyes and let his slave get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the orange-haired teenager went ball-climbing, he noticed the dick above him twitch constantly. When he finally managed to cover both of the giant globes of flesh, Jinta\u2019s member was already semi-hard. Ichigo stood at the base of the dick and looked it over. He was barely an inch compared to it, but he didn\u2019t mind. It was his god\u2019s junk, so it was only right it be so much bigger than his own. Ichigo started to lick the base of the cock, filling his mouth with sweat. Soon he was climbing the sex organ while going in a spiral rotation. He had to make sure that every inch of Lord Jinta\u2019s cock was licked clean. Outside, Jinta moaned as he felt his little bug scale his member. He had never felt something so amazing. This feeling, plus his total domination of Ichigo, was turning him on. When Ichigo finally managed to ascend to the head of Jinta\u2019s cock, it was fully erect and pushing against Jinta\u2019s briefs. This made it hard for Ichigo to climb on top of it, but he did it anyway. Once he was laying flat upon the tip of Jinta\u2019s dick, he could feel himself being compressed between the mighty monster and the white briefs. The giant boy laughed a little when he saw a tiny, moving bump at the peak of the tent he was sporting. Ichigo started lick the pink head of his master\u2019s humongous organ. Pre-cum started to leak from his piss slit, which Ichigo happily lapped up. It was part of his master, and he wanted to taste all of him. His own penis had slowly been getting hard during this whole experience, but he had to ignore it. The task given to him by his mighty god came first. Nevertheless, he unconsciously rubbed his crotched against Jinta\u2019s hot skin while he clambered over the head. Ichigo\u2019s final spot on his journey was the slit, which he slipped his tongue into. It tasted of sweat, pre cum, and dried piss. The flavor of Jinta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta had been tracking Ichigo\u2019s progress and knew he had finished when he felt the inside of his piss slit being cleaned. The young giant opened up his briefs and looked down at his slave with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDone already? Well, a promise is a promise.\u201d Jinta picked Ichigo off his dick and placed him in his palm. He pulled his pants back up and looked over the Soul Reaper. He looked exhausted from all the torture he had to endure, plus the injuries he sustained trying to best him. His tongue also needed a break after that tore of his body. \u201cI guess I can at least give you a rest. I\u2019m kind of tired too, actually. Destroying a city, owning the military, squashing a few Soul Bugs, and putting you in your place\u2026it\u2019s a lot of work!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta laid his bare back against the road and grabbed his discarded shirt. After folding it neatly into a small square, he laid it down on his chest and placed Ichigo on it. With the permission to rest, Ichigo quickly fell asleep; surrounded by the smell of Jinta\u2019s musk. The red head watched Ichigo sleep for a few seconds before dozing off himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the two sleeping boys; a presence was slowly approaching them. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hisagi was frankly quite disgusted with the way Captain Kurotsuchi was handling this situation. He didn't seem to care in the slightest what was happening on Earth as long as he got more data for his precious research. He had basically shrugged when Hitsugaya and Renji were crushed into nothingness, only taking the time to ask Nemu to bring him something. Hisagi had stood by and watched Jinta break Ichigo until he was nothing more than the obedient toy/slave/pet of the giant boy. Clearly this was a serious threat to the world they were dealing with. Something had to be done and fast. Unfortunately no one else seemed to be willing to go out and fight. Well, Kenpachi had seemed pretty gung-ho about it but the Captain Commander had explicitly ordered that no one was to leave the Soul Society until a course of action could be decided on. Hisagi couldn't take the waiting any longer and had sneaked out. As long as he didn't engage Jinta he would be fine. If nothing else he could at least bring something back to help Captain Kurotsuchi out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn person, Hisagi was in awe at the massive kid in front of him. He knew that Jinta had grown massive but the screens in the Soul Society didn't quite do justice to the grandeur of the boy's size. Hisagi truly felt like a little bug next to him. He congratulated Ichigo on lasting so long, holding out, fighting back, and generally refusing to give in for so long. He would probably have been broken long before Ichigo. This was incentive to not get caught. The gate had let him out at the boy's right foot. The toes were pointed in the air as Jinta slept on his back with his arms behind his head, Ichigo snuggling into the shirt he had once been disgusted by as he climbed. Hisagi wasted no time and quickly scaled the giant foot. He flash stepped across Jinta's legs and over his briefs, stopping near Ichigo. He leaned down and tried shaking him awake. Ichigo merely rolled over and continued sleeping. He really was tired. Hisagi wanted to grab him and move him forcibly but didn't know if that would be a good idea anymore. He didn't want Ichigo waking up and making a fuss about leaving Jinta. A kind of Stockholm Syndrome was running rampant in Ichigo's psyche at the moment. He stood back up and flash stepped onto Jinta's face, avoiding the mouth and landing on his cheek. He pulled out a bottle and managed to make a very shallow incision in Jinta's cheek. He filled the small bottle and stoppered it, slipping it back into his shihakusho. Captain Kurotsuchi had been able to get a reading on the boy's spiritual pressure but there was a good chance his blood could hold some secrets that will speed up the process of creating an antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this task done Hisagi flash stepped onto a nearby building, one of the very few left standing, and surveyed the damage. It was truly horrific, like the scene of a bombing. Most of the city's population that was left alive had managed to escape but if Jinta kept up rampaging in this fashion no city would be safe. Nothing would be safe. The landscape was quickly turning into a desolate wasteland, with a few patches in the distance relatively unharmed by Jinta's destruction. When Jinta woke up he would probably finish off what was left of this town and move on to another. Unless there was something specific he wanted to do here yet. Perhaps collect a few new slaves before moving on, breaking a few more spirits like Ichigo's. Hisagi hated this feeling, this feeling of being totally powerless. He almost wanted to go back to the Soul Society and fire the Kido Cannon by himself, anything to rid the world of this giant red haired menace. But he knew he would never be authorized to do something like that. Captain Kurotsuchi said he would need a few days to make an antidote. Well, what if it was too late by then? What if Jinta became unstoppable? What is nothing in the Soul Society could hope to match Jinta's power?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis kind of thought process was getting him nowhere. He decided to head back to the Soul Society and deliver his sample to Captain Kurotsuchi. That at least would give him the illusion of getting something done. He turned on his heel and flash stepped back to Jinta's foot where the gate was waiting for him. He took one last look at the giant and muttered, \"Hang in there Kurosaki. We'll get you out of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he faced the gate and was about to step through when a low rumbling sound filled the air. Turning back around Hisagi was shocked to see</span></div></div>",

The Soul Reaper was shocked at the kid\u2019s speed and couldn\u2019t avoid in time. The hand collided with the Vice-Captain, shattering the ground underneath him and obliterating the gate in the process. Jinta pulled his hand out of the concrete, bringing up the trapped form of his prize. Jinta brought the man up to his face an examined him. \u201cYou thought you could just approach your god without him noticing? Idiot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi tried to break away from the kid\u2019s grasp, but to no effect. The fist incased his entire being; only his head remained poking out of the strong hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJudging by your clothes, you must be a Soul Reaper. You didn\u2019t attack me, so I guess you must be here to offer yourself to me. Am I right? You wanna be my slave, bug?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d Hisagi shouted back. \u201cI\u2019d never serve a monster like you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, that\u2019s the kind of attitude carrot top used to have. Look at him now.\u201d Jinta glanced down at Ichigo, who had rolled down to his lower belly when the kid leaned up. \u201cYou\u2019ll be just like him soon enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta opened his fingers a bit to allow access to Hisagi\u2019s body. Using the thumb and index finger of his other hand, he easily snatched the 9th Squad Lieutenant\u2019s sword from his sheath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be needing this anymore.\u201d Jinta told him as he tossed the blade into his mouth and swallowed. Hisagi watched in horror as Kazeshini was pushed down the boy\u2019s throat to be lost forever in his stomach. Jinta banged his chest and gave a small hiccup. \u201cI was always told never to put sharp things in my mouth, but that was barely a blade of grass!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta directed his attention to a building next to him and searched through its ruins. After a few seconds, he pulled out a large underground pipe that ran underneath the building. Manipulating the metal like it was a piece of string, Jinta wrapped it around Hisagi and then around his own wrist. Soon the proud Soul Reaper was bound tightly to the boy\u2019s wrist like a bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst a necklace, than an earring, and now a bracelet! I should start my own brand of Soul Reaper jewelry.\u201d Jinta shook his hand a bit, making sure Hisagi wasn\u2019t going to slip off. \u201cWell, I\u2019m going back to sleep now. You had the nerve to wake me up, but I\u2019ll punish you for that later.\u201d With that, Jinta laid himself back down and carefully placed the sleeping Ichigo, along with his folded shirt, back on is chest. He folded his hands behind his head and quickly dozed off. Shuhei found himself pressed up against the boy\u2019s bright red hair. He had to be patient and find a way out of here so he could get this blood sample back to Soul Society. The young man was beginning to think it was a bad idea coming here in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026at least his hair smelled nice. </span></div></div>",

In the dark recesses of Hueco Mundo, in Aizen's base Las Noches, Gin Ichimaru was watching the events unfolding in the World of the Living with his usual grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on Gin?\" a voice asked from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGin turned around on his chair and saw that Kaname Tosen had decided to visit him. He waved his hands at the screen and said, \"Something very peculiar is happening in the World of the Living. It appears that a human boy with minor spiritual pressure somehow managed to turn himself into a giant. It's quite amusing actually, the amount of destruction he's causing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTosen frowned at Gin's comments and said, \"Another creature that chooses a path of blood shed. How disgusting. Have you informed Lord Aizen of this development?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! After all he had had high hopes for that city. Now it's almost all gone and the people have evacuated. Kind of throws a monkey wrench into the whole works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGin was right. Aizen's expression hadn't changed in the slightest at this disturbance in his plan but he had had to take quick measures to insure that his plans could still progress without fault. The first step in his plan had been to contact Apollo about what caused the boy's change in the first place. The mad scientist saw it as a new research opportunity and threw himself into working on finding out as much as possible about it. Aizen specifically gave him instructions to find out how it worked, replicate it, and find an antidote. If the process could be perfected untold power could be in Arrancar hands. Apollo was confident in his abilities. It wouldn't be a matter of if he could do it but a matter of when he'd do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter setting this task to Apollo, Aizen had contacted Gin again to give a report on the situation. Gin relayed how the boy was still growing, how the sensors in the equipment indicated a sharply increasing amount of spiritual pressure, and showed a chart that predicted the rate of increase of his power. Aizen smiled when he realized he could still very easily continue his plan. What had started out being a hindrance was slowly turning into a godsend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do wonder what Lord Aizen plans on doing when he figures out how that kid grew.\" Gin wondered aloud. \"If the Research Department in the Soul Society is aware of this then the whole fight could end up changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can only lead to more tragedy.\" Tosen stated blandly. \"I have faith that Lord Aizen will end this quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two doing in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth former Soul Reapers turned to see Grimmjow entering the room. He had been passing by when he heard the conversation between Gin and Tosen. Gin jerked a thumb over his shoulder and said, \"We're just watching some interesting new developments in the World of the Living.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow stared into the screen and was shocked by what he saw. A huge kid lying in the middle of a devastated city, totally at ease and totally unopposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on here?\" Grimmjow asked in a state of awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your guess is as good as mine.\" Gin replied, shrugging. \"This giant kid just appeared out of nowhere and started creating havoc! Oh, and here's something you might find interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGin fiddled with the monitors and the largest screen slowly zoomed in on Jinta's chest. Grimmjow was shocked once again to see Ichigo Kurosaki sleeping there. His face changed expression from surprise, to livid anger, to completely blank. He put his hands into his pockets and turned to leave. At the doorway he turned back and shook his head at Ichigo's face which now filled the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always knew you were a pathetic piece of trash Soul Reaper.\" Grimmjow muttered to himself, sounding almost disappointed at something. Gin couldn't help but snicker at the dejected Espada and turned his attention back to the screens.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo began to toss and turn as he slowly left the realm of sleep. He tried to get up, but found himself entangled in Jinta\u2019s shirt. The article of clothing had wrapped itself around him during his nap. The smell of Jinta\u2019s sweat and musk was everywhere. The teenaged Soul Reaper started to cough at the lack of fresh air and frantically began to crawl threw the whiteness. Eventually, he found an opening and squeezed himself through it, landing on Jinta\u2019s clammy chest. He wobbled to feet and just stood there for a few moments. Jinta\u2019s chest rose and fell as he breathed. Ichigo didn\u2019t know when the giant would wake up, so he decided to take a walk while he waited. By walk he meant a stroll across his master\u2019s massive form! Ichigo began walking down, heading toward the boy\u2019s stomach. He had already gotten to know his master\u2019s torso pretty well during his little licking tour, but now he could walk freely and take in the sights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Soul Reaper\u2019s gaze looked over every inch of Jinta\u2019s upper body. The kid was pretty fit for his age, probably due to the labor work he did at Urahara\u2019s Shop. He was still just a kid, though, so he didn\u2019t have much muscle tone. Ichigo found himself imaging the boy a few years from now; a young teen like himself. He would doubtlessly become pretty good-looking; a man fit to dominate not just this world, but every world. It was something that\u2019d definitely be a privilege to see, but would Ichigo live long enough? His life as a slave was filled with the endless possibility of being killed in a single moment. Heck, he could be crushed right now of Jinta rolled over in his sleep. Also, what if Jinta continued to grow? The bigger he got, the less important Ichigo would appear to him. He would go from a bug to a speck. Some people keep bugs as pets, but what use would someone have for keeping a mere speck of lint? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ichigo\u2019s mind worried about these possibilities, he was walking down Jinta\u2019s abdomen without looking where he was going. He felt his left shoe step into open air instead of the soft flesh of the boy\u2019s belly. Ichigo snapped back into reality when he realized he was about to walk right into Jinta\u2019s navel. The teenaged bug tried to steady himself with one foot and ended up falling back on his butt, narrowly escaping a tumble. Ichigo slowly crawled over to the edge of the bellybutton and looked down. It was really deep like he remembered; he could barely see the bottom. He didn\u2019t know whether he wanted to go back in there again, but knew that he had many duties as a slave. Cleaning the boy\u2019s navel was probably one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll find some more slaves soon and we can split the work.\u201d Ichigo thought, not knowing Jinta had already found another slave. Deciding that going any lower would be an invasion of his god\u2019s privacy, Ichigo started the trek back up the boy\u2019s body. When he finally reached the chest again, he drifted over to the edge and looked down at Jinta\u2019s exposed armpit. Like his crotch, there was a tiny amount of red hair, but basically hairless. Jinta must have just recently hit puberty. Ichigo unconsciously took a whiff of the air and instantaneously jumped back, pinching his nose. Jinta\u2019s body odor was really potent there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo\u2019s attention was turned toward Jinta\u2019s face when he heard the boy groan a bit. Jinta\u2019s face tensed up a bit before his eyes flickered open and drifted to Ichigo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatcha doing, carrot top?\u201d Jinta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I was just taking a walk along your body. Hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Did you like what you saw?\u201d Jinta joked as he leaned up. His chest lifted at an angle, causing Ichigo to slide toward the giant\u2019s stomach again. \u201cOops.\u201d Jinta caught Ichigo in his hand and brought him up to his face. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s my fau--\u201d Ichigo was suddenly distracted when he noticed his god\u2019s new \u201caccessory\u201d around his wrist. The figure looked familiar to the Substitute Soul Reaper. \u201cHey\u2026aren\u2019t you Hisagi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know this bug, carrot top?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026sort of. He\u2019s the Vice-Captain of the\u2026um\u20267th Division?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u20269th.\u201d Hisagi corrected. The youthful Soul Reaper began coughing, having had his face buried in Jinta\u2019s hair for the past few hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother Vice-Captain, eh? What\u2019s with Soul Society and sending all their high ranking members to me?\u201d Jinta pondered as he grabbed his wrinkled up shirt and stood up. After placing Ichigo in his pants pocket, Jinta slipped is shirt back over his body and took a look around. \u201cHey, carrot top, what time is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo climbed up Jinta\u2019s pocket and leaned himself over the edge. The teen took a look at his watch before answering his god\u2019s question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT\u2019S A FEW MINUTES PAST ONE!\u201d Ichigo yelled up at Jinta so he could hear him clearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it? There\u2019s still the entire afternoon to play around.\u201d The titan brought his wrist up to his eyes and grinned at Hisagi. \u201cSo, my new slave, what should we do first? I could always start breaking you in\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Hisagi could say anything in response to Jinta's question of what to do first a low rumbling sound like distant thunder filled the air. Jinta patted his stomach and said, \"Well I guess that answers my question. Time to find some grub!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi looked around as best he could. There wasn't anything edible in sight. How much food would be required to fill this god like boy's belly anyway? Jinta seemed to be thinking the same thing as he started walking towards a less desolated area of the city. The buildings here were still standing relatively well but Jinta saw to it that they didn't stay that way. Just walking was enough to demolish the smaller ones as Jinta's steps were like miniature earthquakes. The larger ones had the honor of being smashed beneath the boy's sole. Hisagi, who hadn't been monitoring the situation as thoroughly as certain other Soul Reapers, was shocked by Jinta's callous disregard for human life. Ichigo, on the other hand, had his arms crossed over the edge of the pocket and was resting his chin on them, watching his god walk with a neutral expression on his face. He had an idea of what Jinta was going to do next and knew that he should care but he couldn't. Lesser beings had to be sacrificed so that Jinta could continue to flourish as a god. Finally, Jinta arrived at the edge of town where hundreds of cars were attempting to flee the city and were caught in a traffic jam. Horns were honking and people were screaming as Jinta's massive shadow fell over all of them. Jinta shook his head with a smile on his face at the antics of the bugs beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's adorable you insects think you can just escape from me. You should know better. You can't leave when you need to serve your god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that statement the boy reached down and scooped up about ten cars in his palm. With a devilish grin he opened his mouth wide and dropped them all inside. It would take far too long to try and empty the cars first to get at the people. It would be simpler to just devour them metal, rubber, and all. All it took was a few quick chews to decimate the vehicles before the whole mass was swallowed. Jinta then reached down and grabbed two more handfuls, stuffing them greedily in his mouth. Hisagi was sickened by this whole process mostly by the fact that Jinta was eating living humans but also because, being connected to the boy's wrist, he was rapidly moving up and down. It was like being trapped on a hellish amusement park ride. Ichigo was scanning the ground as Jinta ate, making sure no one got away before his master was done eating. A fleeing group of individuals caught his eye and he pointed them out and shouted, \"LORD JINTA! TEN OF THEM ARE TRYING TO ESCAPE DOWN THAT ALLEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta jerked his head in the direction that his slave was pointing and saw them. A few quick steps was all it took before the group was in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try bugs! You can't get away that easily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuffed them all in his mouth, which didn't even fill it, and swallowed them whole. Jinta burped slightly and sighed happily. He patted his pocket gently and said, \"Good work carrot top. Keep an eye out for any others that try to escape okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL DO MY BEST LORD JINTA!\" Ichigo shouted back, pleased that his master had paid him a compliment. Out of the corner of his eye he noticed another bakery. He tore off the roof and gathered up some baked goods which he dropped into the pocket Ichigo was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be hungry little guy. Eat that when I'm done here.\" Jinta instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded knowing that his master knew he would obey. Jinta turned his attention back to the fleeing morsels at his feet and continued his buffet. Car after car disappeared into the boy god's gullet along with whatever person tried to make a break for it. Ichigo helped him to devour about fifty people before he was finally full. A loud burp rocketed through the city as Jinta patted his full stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great! Even better than my first feast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAY I PLEASE EAT MY FOOD NOW LORD JINTA?\" Ichigo asked obediently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta smiled at his little slave and nodded. Ichigo smiled back and dropped into the pocket to eat the various breads, muffins, cakes, and other baked goods that were pooled at the bottom of the boy's pocket. As his obedient slave ate Jinta turned his attention to his new slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So 69 face we can do this the easy way or the hard way. Are you going to submit and be my slave or am I going to have to condition you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi took a deep breath and shouted, \"I'll never do anything you say you monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that sounds familiar. Where have I heard that before?\" Jinta pretended to think hard. \"Oh yeah! That's what Ichigo said in the beginning! And now look at him! He's helping me! Before long you'll be doing the same. So, does that change your mind? Last chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi merely spit at Jinta, the small glob of saliva landing on Jinta's arm. Jinta wiped it away without a second though and said, \"Good. I was hoping you'd be difficult. It's more fun breaking you little slaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi put on a brave face, but he knew that what was coming was going to be intense and horrifying.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta used his fingers to break the metal bracelet trapping Hisagi. He used the same fingers pluck the young man from his ruined bonds and bring him up to his master\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get started, shall we? You can start at the bottom like good, insignificant bug.\u201d Jinta told the Vice-Captain before he lightly flicked him toward the street below. Hisagi flew through the air too fast and control himself and smacked right into the black concrete. The impact had pushed him deep into the ground, so it would take some effort to dislodge himself. Hisagi never had the opportunity, though, as a shadow suddenly covered him. The Soul Reaper looked up to see the giant brat\u2019s foot descending on him. Unable to avoid the massive boyfoot, Hisagi could only lean back as far as he could to allow the foot to cover him. Much to Hisagi\u2019s relief, the foot stopped just inches above his nose. If he leaned up even a little bit, his face would smack right into Jinta\u2019s sweaty skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that you\u2019re in a fitting place, you can start licking. I don\u2019t expect you to clean my foot while you\u2019re like that, but I do expect you to lick until you\u2019ve understood the superiority of it! If you refuse, which I know you\u2019re thinking of doing, I\u2019ll be smearing your remains off my foot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Hisagi didn\u2019t do anything. The thought of licking this monster\u2019s foot was just too humiliating, and he was prepared to die the moment he joined Soul Society. However, this was different. He wouldn\u2019t die on the battlefield protecting his comrades\u2026he\u2019d die under the foot of some cruel kid! It\u2019d be a pointless and humiliating death. Hisagi decided to play along with the giant for now, if it meant avoiding such an end. He stuck out his tongue and began licking the bottom of Jinta\u2019s foot. The first few licks were the worse, since he had to clean that spot of any dirt and rubble that had stuck to Jinta\u2019s foot. The rest weren\u2019t joyful either, but at least it was only sweat he was licking up. No matter how much he licked the same spot, however, the perspiration never seemed to end. The spot quickly produced more sweat each time Hisagi cleaned it. It didn\u2019t take long until Hisagi was mentally wishing Jinta would take his foot away. It wasn\u2019t until ten minutes later that he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, 69 man, how did your god\u2019s foot taste?\u201d Jinta asked as he took his foot away. Hisagi was quick to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTerrible!\u201d he yelled up at Jinta as loud as he could. His tongue wasn\u2019t in the best of health, so wasn\u2019t able to speak very loudly or clearly. Jinta still seemed to get what he said, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWrong answer, bug boy!\u201d Jinta grinned widely as he stomped the ground near Hisagi as hard as he could. The earth was completely obliterated and Hisagi was sent spiraling upward. Hisagi spun rapidly toward Jinta\u2019s face, watching the boy\u2019s massive body pass by him. Before he could pass the boy\u2019s chest, Jinta\u2019s palm appeared and whacked the Soul Reaper back toward Earth. The giant boy only used a small fraction of is strength, but to Hisagi it was like being punched by Captain Zaraki on a bad day. He once again smacked into the concrete, and this time his entire body was in pain. He couldn\u2019t even gather the energy to stand up. It\u2019s not like he had a chance, tough, since Jinta\u2019s foot once again enveloped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, do it again!\u201d Jinta commanded from above. Hisagi\u2019s only protest was a deep sigh of annoyance before he got to work again. Once again, the foul taste of dirt, grime, and preteen sweat haunted his taste buds. He could lick this sole for hours and he\u2019d never get use to it. Hisagi wondered if submitting to Jinta affected the taste at all. Ichigo seemed like he\u2019d take anything from Jinta and think it was a blessing from a higher power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother ten minutes later passed before Jinta took his foot away and asked Hisagi the same question as before. Hisagi thought about his answer a bit this time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was\u2026great. Best thing I ever tasted.\u201d the Vice-Captain lied. Jinta knew he was lying through his teeth, but that didn\u2019t bother him at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better. Since you like it so much, I\u2019ll make a deal with you.\u201d Jinta said to his lowly slave as he wiggled his toes. The gigantic digits tore at the road like it was Styrofoam. \u201cCome over here and give both my feet some kisses. Show them how much you love them, insect. If you do, I\u2018ll let you ride on my shoulder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi was at a loss for words. This brat had just forced Hisagi to humiliate himself, and now he wanted him to do it willingly? There was no way\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m just asking. You can refuse if you want. Heck, you can say no and I\u2019ll still let you ride on my shoulder! However\u2026I won\u2019t help you get there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi had a puzzled expression on his face. He didn\u2019t quite understand what Jinta meant by that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou get what I mean, little man? I\u2019m saying that if you don\u2019t kiss my feet, you\u2019re going to have to climb up here yourself! And no walking on spirit particles, either! I\u2019ll just smack you right back down like a mosquito.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi took a moment to look over Jinta\u2019s titanic form. He was just too big\u2026it\u2019d take forever to get that high! What if Jinta got bored and decided to take a walk? It\u2019d make the trek even more dangerous. However, if Hisagi refused both proposals, Jinta would probably just walk pass him and leave him behind. Actually, the more accurate thing to say is that he\u2019d walk ON him. </span></div></div>",

So that left him with just the one option. He slowly approached the big toe of the left foot and leaned forward, his lips brushing against the sweaty, dirty skin. He pursed his lips and kissed the toe lightly. Jinta flicked his toe, hitting Hisagi in the face and adding to his growing list of cuts and bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, little man! You're going to have to do better than that! Kiss all over the toe, every toe, and when you're done, kiss all over the top of the foot, and all over the side, and then I'll lift it up so you can get the bottom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi growled in frustration, hating the condescension in the boy's voice, the way he knew that he was a god to everyone beneath him. But if he didn't do this it would the end of him. He was starting to get a feeling of what sort of tortures Ichigo must have gone through. He had lasted quite awhile. How long would Hisagi last? He bent down again and kissed the toe, moving in a line down to the ground before moving to the sides and heading in between the toes. Jinta pinched his toes together, pinning Hisagi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea slave! Just like that and you'll earn your seat up here!\" He patted his shoulder and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toes released the Vice Captain and allowed him to continue his worship. By the time he was done kissing the pinky toe his lips were already dry and chapped to go along with his sand papery tongue. Unfortunately he wasn't allowed to stop. If he held still for more than fifteen consecutive seconds Jinta would raise his foot and drop it, causing a small earthquake to erupt over the area, knocking Hisagi to his butt and reminding him of his task. Hisagi scrambled on top of the foot and, on his hands and knees, began kissing it all over, starting at the toes and making his way to the ankle. When he was done, Jinta lifted his foot and watched with a mean glee as the bug like Soul Reaper rolled down his foot and landed on his back on the hard concrete. He had no intentions of being gentle with this slave. At least, not until he showed the same devotion as Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo himself was watching this whole show from the pocket, wondering why Hisagi was being so stubborn. He remembered that he had been like that once and all it had done was bring him pain and humiliation. He wanted to shout down to Hisagi to just give in. His life would be so much easier. Sure, he'd have to be a slave, but it was better to be a living slave than a dead bug right? Right. Ichigo looked up and smiled slightly at the face of his god and master. He looked like he was having such a good time. He really did enjoy what he was doing. Ichigo determined that he would help him continue having fun and helping him in any other ways he could. That would show him, no matter how insignificant he became, he could still be useful. It was his only chance for survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack down below Hisagi was still diligently kissing Jinta's foot, his body covered in the debris of the slowly dying town and the sweat of the youthful god that he now served. His lips had gone numb from the constant contact with the foot so he could no longer feel the rough skin of the foot. It was a small comfort. With the foot finally totally serviced Hisagi stepped out from under it and sighed. Jinta tapped his foot impatiently and said, \"Come on! Move on to the next one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi groaned and looked at the other foot. Just as huge, just as dirty, and just sweaty. It was he was in Hell, forced to perform the same task, over and over again for eternity. He forced himself to move closer to the big toe and start kissing it as well. Jinta nodded contentedly, knowing this was having an effect on the young Soul Reaper's psyche. With any luck he'd be broken faster than Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi kissed and kissed and kissed, moving up down and around the toes until they were all covered again. Throwing himself on top of the foot he crawled again, the same path he took when he was on the opposite foot. Once he reached the top he knew he would be dumped onto the pavement and, sure enough, he was. He got to his feet before Jinta could order him to and continued kissing, starting at the rough heel and making his way up the foot. Jinta lowered it more and more so that Hisagi could reach all parts of the foot. Finally, with one last smooch, his work was done. He collapsed onto the pavement, his body weak from the constant physical torture and the worship session that had immediately followed. Jinta scooped him up in his hand and brought him up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad for a first try. You got nothing on carrot top though!\" Jinta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THANK YOU LORD JINTA!\" Ichigo yelled up from his position in the pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta set Hisagi down on his left shoulder and said, \"You can hang out there for awhile. Remember though, if you try to escape I'll know about it and you will be punished for it. Severely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi didn't bother replying. He was too wiped out from his exertions. Thoughts of escape were floating around under thoughts of just resting for awhile. The shoulder he was currently in a prone position on was large enough that he didn't have to worry about falling off unless Jinta forgot he was there so he closed his eyes and tried to block out what was happening to him and rest for what was sure to be more trying times in the future.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With his new slave all tuckered out and resting, Jinta decided to look for something else to amuse him. A quick glance around the city showed that he had destroyed pretty much everything in the immediate area. Surely there was still more places he hadn\u2019t visited, though. The giant boy picked a direction and started walking, his colossal feet crushing the destroyed buildings even more. It didn\u2019t take long before he reached an area that looked almost untouched. The only sign of his presence was the many abandoned cars and buildings that the little bugs had left behind when they heard of Jinta\u2019s rampage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this? This place actually looks decent! We can\u2019t have that!\u201d Jinta shouted to himself before kicking everything in sight. His feet uprooted buildings, trees, and other structures with ease. If a normal kid had tried kicking a building, they\u2019d probably leave with a badly stubbed toe. Jinta on the other hand was demolishing buildings like they were made of sand. Metal, glass, and debris all went flying to parts unknown. After Jinta had finished making everything within his reach look like a war zone, he turned his interest to something else.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slightly taller building caught his eye. The young god placed his bare sole on top of the construction and slowly began to apply pressure. He smirked as he listened to the glass windows of the building shatter and its supports give away one by one. Soon the building was collapsing floor by floor until all that remained  was its roof which had been moved to ground level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, weak.\u201d Jinta muttered as he looked for something more worthy. His large eyes fell upon several office buildings that had been built side-by-side. They were all of similar shape and equal in size. Jinta\u2019s idea was an obvious one. He walked over to the first building and used his finger to give the smaller object a gentle push. The building was easily pushed backward and smashed into the one next to it, sending glass and smoke everywhere. The second building, in turn, toppled over and smashed into the third one. The third building collapsed onto the fourth. This continued until the last building fell onto the street and buried a few more buildings under its mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere I thought dominos were boring!\u201d Jinta laughed, but still wasn\u2019t done. He looked for something else to destroy. \u201cHey, carrot top, you see anything you recognize?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked down at the city from Jinta\u2019s pants pocket. It was astounding how different the city looked, both from Jinta\u2019s destruction and from his new view. It took a few moments before he noticed a building he knew all too well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s my school over there!\u201d Ichigo said, pointing in the direction of the facility. Jinta looked where his slave was pointing and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSchool, eh? Blech, who needs school?!\u201d Jinta thundered as he stomped over to the white building and stood over it, overshadowing the small building with ease. Ichigo watched as Jinta gripped the empty building by its sides and tore it out of the ground, holding it away from his waist. The giant felt the weak construction ready to fall apart in his hands. Before it had the chance to fall apart, Jinta drew his leg back and gave it a swift kick. The high school didn\u2019t have a chance and exploded in his hands. The former Substitute Soul Reaper smiled as his school, classroom, desk, even the homework he forgot yesterday was obliterated in a brilliant display. He used to wish his school would burn down so he didn\u2019t have to go, but he never would have imagined that a giant would destroy it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta wiped his hands with his shirt and studied the area. The once untainted area had been reduced to nothing but another area of disaster. However, is interest was beginning to wane. He enjoyed watching his little victims run from his huge form and listening to their screams of terror. Now, all he could hear was the slow collapse of lifeless structures and his own breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to move onto another town.\u201d Jinta told himself. He looked left and right and scratched the back of is head. \u201cSo\u2026where IS the next town?\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jinta finished his rampage of Karakura Town, the one proud city now nothing more than a smoldering ruin littered with the decaying remains of buildings and the occasional corpse of a human caught in the melee. There was nothing left for him, nothing at all. Even though he was a massive tower of a human boy he couldn't immediately see the next town over. He scanned the horizon and saw the ocean off in one direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better not go that way. There won't be much to see at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned the other way and saw, in three directions, featureless countryside. He pointed in each direction and thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, carrot top, you got any idea where the next town is?\" Jinta asked his bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo thought about it. He wasn't very good with geography and hadn't left the town in his life. The only times he had was when he went to the Soul Society and Jinta couldn't get there. At least, Ichigo didn't think he could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm terribly sorry Lord Jinta. But I don't know.\" Ichigo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. I'll just pick a direction at random.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta closed his eyes and pointed forward before spinning around, devastating the pavement around him, pipes exploding and spraying water over his feet. When he opened his eyes he saw that he was pointing at the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that didn't work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and performed this ritual again. As he did this, the higher ups in Soul Society were taking action. This was their chance. They needed to make sure that the giant didn't escape and cause any more damage to property or human life. Orders were passed down, Soul Reapers dashed left and right, and computers printed out figures that detailed the amount of kido it was going to take to create what they needed to create. A group of the best kido users in the Soul Society gathered in a group inside a plain white room, with a screen showing Karakura Town on the ceiling. They all started chanting spells, some using tools to increase the potency of the kido. One by one they finished the chant and slowly, a barrier appeared around the town. Each Soul Reaper purposefully finished slightly after the Soul Reaper before them so that the barrier was layered, like an onion. This way, the barrier would be able to withstand more punishment if it were to be attacked and, judging by the boy's actions before this, it would receive a lot of punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Karakura Town, Jinta, after having spun around for the last ten minutes, had finally pointed in a direction that wasn't the ocean. He sat for a minute, waiting for the area to stop spinning before standing up. Even then, he still felt a wave of dizziness pass over him, causing him to stumble and fall to the ground again. Cracks radiated out from Jinta's body, causing fissures to appear, debris falling into the newly made holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! Dammit, that wasn't the smartest thing to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checked his pocket and was glad to see that his obedient teen was safe. Ichigo had retreated to the bottom of the pocket and the soft material had protected him. Unfortunately, looking at his shoulder, he noticed that Hisagi had fallen away. He quickly scanned the area where he had fallen and found him sprawled head over heels in a pile of rubble. He was definitely awake again, his eyes wide and slightly twitchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be more careful sixty nine man. A god like me can't be bothered to regulate all his movements for the sake of a bug.\" Jinta taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi wanted badly to yell, to attack, to maim this boy for his words but knew he would just be swatted like a fly or crushed like an insect. He needed to wait for a better opportunity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta grabbed the young Soul Reaper by the foot and hoisted him in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You're already learning not to talk back.\" Jinta said. \"Back on the shoulder with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped Hisagi on his shoulder who sat cross legged, too agitated to sleep anymore. He watched as Jinta made his way to the edge of Karakura Town, clearly intending to head to a new town. He bit his lip, wanting to do something to stop the monster but he was totally powerless. Any kido he could think of would just bounce off his skin. As Hisagi was resigning himself to the fate of the next town, Jinta suddenly crashed into something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the--? What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta put his hands against the barrier and knocked against it. It felt like an invisible wall was before him. He had seen things like this before while working for Urahara. It was a kido barrier. A strong looking one at that. Jinta grinned as he realized this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! This should be a great challenge for me! You slaves watch as your god takes down this barrier!\" He cracked his knuckles, preparing to punch the barrier with all his might. With a roar he pushed forward, his knuckles connecting with the barrier. The entire face of the barrier shuddered, appearing briefly around Jinta's hand before returning to invisibility. Jinta shook his hand slightly and was surprised to see the barrier was totally unaffected. He punched it again and got the same results. He kicked it, first with his right foot then his left and just made his toes go numb. He lowered his shoulder and rammed against the barrier, forcing as much power into it as he could. Nothing. Jinta didn't like this at all. He had been unopposed all today. At best he had been annoyed. Now...he was trapped...he didn't like that idea AT ALL. Gods didn't get stopped by stupid magic walls. He wasn't going to rest until this barrier was dust.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In Soul Society, Captain Kurotsuchi was sitting at his interface going over the flow of data while he listened to a report from Captain Ukitake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, so you trapped the brat in the same city he was rampaging in. How clever, but what\u2019s next? That barrier, as strong as it is, will break before I\u2019m finished with the antidote.\u201d explained Mayuri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re aware of that. We plan on launching a surprise attack soon. As long as he continues to bash away at that barrier, he\u2019ll eventually show signs of fatigue. Even gods get tired\u2026\u201d replied Jushiro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, but are you positive you can kill it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not. It would take too much manpower to even have a chance at killing him. We intend only to secure him until you\u2019ve finished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow amusing. You think you can keep THAT held down for a day or two? Don\u2019t make jokes.\u201d the captain chuckled as he pushed a few buttons on his chair and a small hole opened on his interface. A metallic claw crept out of the hole and dropped a small pill into the man\u2019s hand. Mayuri handed this pill to his fellow captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d asked Ukitake, glancing over the small pill in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA drug I created to put Hollows to sleep so I could dissect them while they still breathed. This Jinta is a bit\u2026bigger than a Hollow, but it should still kick in and put him to sleep for a few days. More than enough time for me to finish this antidote.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll give this to Vice-Captain Kira. He\u2019ll be leading the attack force.\u201d With that, Ukitake left the lab with only a slight wave from the seated captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, in the human world, Jinta was still beating down on the barrier blocking is path. The kido barrier was slowly weakening, but it was still too early for any visible damage to be seen. To Jinta, it was like he wasn\u2019t doing any damage at all. The giant was beginning to pant loudly, sweat pouring from his forehead. He wiped the sweat away with his arm and glared at the invisible wall in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid barrier! Why won\u2019t you break!\u201d he shouted, hammering the wall with his mighty fists. \u201cI\u2026refuse\u2026to be stopped!\u201d Jinta punished the wall again, but kept his fist against the barrier. He leaned on his arm and tried to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord Jinta, maybe you should take a break. At this rate you\u2019ll tire yourself out.\u201d Ichigo said with some concern in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, carrot top! Gods don\u2019t get tired!\u201d Jinta drew his first back and was about to give the barrier another knuckle sandwich until he felt a familiar sensation around his neck. Several kido ropes looped themselves around the boy\u2019s neck and pulled backwards, causing Jinta to stumble away from the wall. The red head looked back to see the group of Soul Reapers that were casting the kido on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot you bugs again! Do I have to squash some more of you?!\u201d Jinta grabbed the ropes around his neck and tried to pull them off, but to no avail. What would have been an easy task was made much harder from is exhaustion. In addition, more kido ropes wrapped themselves around his throat and made it difficult for the giant to speak. \u201cBastards! You better say your prayers!\u201d Jinta was about to turn around and stomp the living daylights out of the foolish bugs, but two groups of Soul Reapers were waiting for him on either side and cast more kido ropes around his hands. With a mighty tug, Jinta\u2019s arms were pulled down and his body went with them, forcing the god to his knees. The Soul Reapers attached their kido to the ground, binding the giant to the earth. Jinta growled and pulled at the ropes, but only managed to cause more pain to is sore joints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi, who had been watching everything, felt himself being lifted up and flash stepped off the kid\u2019s shoulder. When the figure placed him on the ground, the 9th squad vice-captain looked up to meet the emotionless eyes of the 3rd squad vice-captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKira? What are you doing here?\u201d Hisagi asked the blond man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo take down this monster, and to rescue you of course. Who gave you the order to go to the World of the Living?\u201d Kira asked with a serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. I couldn\u2019t just wait while this brat did whatever he felt like. I had to at least check on the situation personally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat worked out well.\u201d Kira joked with a rare smile. A few more Soul Reapers ran by the two vice-captains. This attack force was a bit bigger than the last one. Hisagi stood up and stopped one of the Soul Reapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on.\u201d he ordered the young-looking Soul Reaper as he reached into his clothes and took out the vial of blood he had taken from Jinta. \u201cPlease go back to Soul Society and give this to Captain Kurotsuchi. It should be of some use to him.\u201d The young Soul Reaper took the vial and nodded to his superior before turning around and heading back the way he came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should head back to, you don\u2019t look so good.\u201d Izuru told Shuhei as he noticed the latter could barely stay on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m more worried about you; do you have a plan? Once he gets his energy back, he\u2019ll break trough those ropes like they\u2019re plastic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have that covered.\u201d Kira replied as he reached into his clothes and took out the pill Captain Ukitake had given him. \u201cWait there, this won\u2019t take long.\u201d Kira flash stepped a few times until he was face-to-face with the giant menace known as Jinta. Jinta looked at the puny bug and gave him a killer glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to guess you\u2019re the one in charge, right?\u201d Jinta asked as he grinded his teeth in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct. I\u2019m Vice-Captain Izuru Kira of the 3rd Division.\u201d Kira responded with an emotionless face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m going to do with you once I\u2019m free. Just know this: you\u2019re deader than dead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah. Keep yapping.\u201d Kira teased the giant kid as he got ready toss the pill into the giant\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ichigo was at a loss of words. His master\u2026is god\u2026was being restrained! There was just no way a bunch of lower life forms could do this to him! Maybe Jinta was just pretending to be trapped for a little fun? Had that barrier really taken so much out of him? Jinta had annihilated every force that fought against him, but was this the end? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything was going exactly as planned. It was easier than anyone had hoped. The Soul Society was known for its fierce efficiency in taking care of threats. Within seconds Jinta would be sleeping like a baby and the nightmare would be over. Karakura Town would be rebuilt, the souls that were currently flooding the Soul Society would be taken care of, and everything would continue as it did before this hellish attack. Kira had pulled back his hand and was about to toss the pill into the monster's mouth when something happened. Kira thought...it almost looked like...Jinta's mouth was moving up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta noticed it long before anyone else. A powerful energy was building up inside him, filling him with new energy. He stood to his feet and tore the ropes apart like they nothing and grinned at Kira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, I'm going to enjoy this!\" He cracked his knuckles which sounded as ominous as thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a step forward and was about to grab Kira when he felt something else happening to his body. The energy that had revitalized him was now working over time, filling his body with power. It was a feeling he had felt twice before. He laughed a laugh that slowly deepened as his body grew even bigger. The Soul Reapers on the ground desperately tried to restrain him with kido ropes but they snapped almost as soon as they caught hold. Jinta's body was swelling at such a rate they couldn't keep him down. Jinta yawned theatrically and said, \"Wow, and I thought you bugs were pathetic before. You're becoming less than bugs to me every second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked up in awe at Jinta. He had feared this. His god was becoming even greater. Would he, a speck of lint, be treated as before? Would Jinta grow bored of him and merely crush him? Or eat him? Even as the fear was evident in his mind Ichigo couldn't help but feel relieved. His god was truly great. He had been worried for no reason. Truly Jinta was amazing. He would never again doubt his god and master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi, meanwhile, was stumbling along, trying to avoid Jinta's growing toes. The mammoth mountains of flesh that he had kissed not long ago were towering overhead, completely capable of destroying him. He barely managed to avoid the massive pillars by diving to the side. Hisagi collapsed onto the ground looking up in horror. Everything had been perfect and now...he only prayed that the boy wouldn't find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira determinedly flash stepped upwards towards Jinta's mouth. Jinta watched as the Soul Reaper attempted to finish his mission. He felt unstoppable again. After he was done here the barrier around this pathetic ruin would be nothing to him. He slowly stopped growing and stared down at the speck before him. Surprisingly he could still clearly see him. In fact, he could see him far better than he could before he grew! He sniffed the air and realized he could distinguish a bunch of different scents. Dust, water, sweat, the left over baked goods in his pocket, everything! He cocked his ear and listened. He could pick out every individual voice coming from the ground, each murmur of fear, Hisagi's prayers that he wouldn't be found and even Ichigo's mutterings from his pocket about how he could be useful to his god. Jinta looked down at Kira again and saw he was getting ready to throw something. He could see the tiny pill leave the Soul Reaper's hand and fly toward his mouth. Jinta reached up and grabbed the tiny pill between two of his massive digits. He held it out for Kira to see, held perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try emo boy. Was this supposed to stop me? Pills can't stop a GOD!\" Jinta roared the last word, the force of his voice pushing Kira back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing. All of Jinta's senses had increased in sensitivity to the point that he could interact personally with the specks at his toes. He truly was a god. He reached forward again and plucked Kira out of the air. To Kira it was like two skyscrapers coming together, holding him tightly, but not crushingly. It was an odd experience. Jinta brought the Soul Reaper to his face and said, \"I warned you. I said you'd be deader than dead when I was done with you. Now I think I know a good way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta's voice was like a force in and of itself. It rolled deeply over Kira's body, vibrating within him, filling him with a primal fear. He had never faced anything this terrifying before in his life. Jinta lifted him up above his head and said, \"Be lucky. You're going to become a part of a god's body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight flick of his wrist Kira was propelled down onto the massive boy's tongue. Kira looked up in horror as the mouth snapped shut leaving him in total darkness. Jinta swallowed, able to taste every aspect of Kira's body and clothes. He was...not very tasty, but he needed to be punished. He licked his lips and looked down at the Soul Reapers beneath him. He crossed his arms and said, \"I'll be with you guys in a minute. First I have to find my other slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent down, the earth rumbling quite severely from his every movement. His massive eye scanned the ground and soon found Hisagi, hiding partially under some debris. With infinite care Jinta pushed aside the debris, in complete control of every part of his body, no matter how small. He gripped Hisagi between his fingers and lifted him to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sixty nine face! Since you kissed my feet earlier I'm not going to kill you with the rest of these Soul Reapers. When you're rested up we'll see if you're still being stubborn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi just hung there, at the complete mercy of a being far greater than he. He didn't know what to do anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta dropped him onto his shoulder and turned his attention to the Soul Reapers at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...its your guys' turn!\" He said with an evil grin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou bugs should feel lucky; you\u2019re going to die by the hands of a god!\u201d Jinta boomed as he crouched down and reached a hand for the large group of Soul Reapers. The men watched as a hand the size of an urban block lowered upon them. They were too scared to move and sweating like pigs. As Jinta got ready to crush the specks in his fist, he suddenly noticed something odd. As his fingers moved through the air, the space they occupied moved with them. Startled, the kid giant stood back up and examined his hand. He wiggled his fingers and watched them manipulate the very fabric of space. Was he\u2026bending reality? \u201cWhoa, that\u2019s awesome!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Soul Reapers below didn\u2019t know why the god had started ignoring them, but didn\u2019t question it. They took the opportunity to run for their lives. By the time Jinta noticed them, they had gotten pretty far away. It didn\u2019t matter a bit, however, since even from this distance Jinta would simply have to lift a foot to end their pitiful lives. Still, the act of defiance made him angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere do you insects think you\u2019re going?! STOP!\u201d Jinta hollered the last word, forcing his command at the fleeing bugs like a gale-force hurricane. When the sound hit the Soul Reapers\u2019 ears like a sonic boom, they froze on the spot. As if glued to the street, every one of the Soul Reapers were paralyzed. Not by fear this time, but by something else. Something that transcended them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?! I can\u2019t move!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMe neither! My legs are frozen!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re all gonna die!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jinta didn\u2019t know what to say, but liked whatever it was. Somehow, the bodies of the poor mortals were forced to obey him\u2026even if their minds resisted. Jinta just smiled and lifted his titanic boyfoot over the insects. The frightened men could only watch and pray as a sole several miles long blocked out the sun and descended. Less than a second was all it took for every one of them to be snuffed out like bugs. Jinta lifted his foot back up to reveal nothing but a footprint. Anything that remained of the weak insects were either buried or stuck to his sole and mixed with tons debris and grime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat takes care of them. Anyone else?\u201d Jinta looked around and, using his new super sight, spotted three Soul Reapers fleeing together. They must have hightailed it out of there the moment things got bad. Cowards. Rather than take the two or three steps it would take to catch up with them, Jinta decided to test out this new reality bending powers of his. Using his fingers, he gripped the space in front of him and tore it like he would a sheet of paper. Reality peeled back and revealed a black void beneath it. Using the same hand, Jinta reached into the fissure. Like he had imagined, his hand reappeared near the Soul Reapers via another tear and blocked their path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you Death Gods know? Real gods are omnipresent!\u201d Jinta told them as he moved his hand and scooped the three up along with a lot of debris. When he removed his hand from the void, he was holding three injured Soul Reapers buried somewhere under tons of rubble. Finding it too tedious to pick them out, Jinta just tossed his handful into his gaping mouth and chewed loudly. A deep gulp emptied his mouth of the city block. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonder what else I can do. Anyone else out there?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, there was a single survivor. A young Soul Reaper fresh out of the academy. This was his first mission in the living world and he was scared shitless. Everyone was dead and he was alone, hiding behind a half-destroyed building. As he listened to the thundering sounds of Jinta\u2019s footsteps, he silently prayed he wouldn\u2019t be found. The sound stopped after awhile and silence filled the air. The young man didn\u2019t hear anything for a few minutes and decided that the monster had left. He was about to start a mad run, when he stopped himself. He looked down to see that he was several miles in the air! The entire building and the ground it stood on was floating above the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could hear your breathing, tiny man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newbie looked up and saw the face of the giant grinning down at him. Jinta had his hands on his hips as he stared the scared coward down. The god had manipulated gravity and forced the building to float just above his chest. He didn\u2019t even have to move a muscle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026please spare me.\u201d the Soul Reaper stuttered, tears flowing down is cheeks. Jinta just shook his head and decreed, \u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the god\u2019s will known, the lone survivor watched as Jinta\u2019s nostrils opened wider and he took a deep breath through his nose. Before he knew it, the Soul Reaper\u2019s feet were off the ground and he was hurtling toward Jinta\u2019s nose with bits and pieces of the building. He flew into the nostril and became stuck in a big mound of the boy\u2019s snot. He couldn\u2019t even struggle; he was stuck like he was fused to the mucus. He was still alive, at least. Jinta just assumed he was dead and couldn\u2019t detect the Soul Reaper anymore. Nonetheless, it would only be a matter of time before he suffocated or was crushed by the kid\u2019s snots. Maybe he\u2019d get lucky and the boy would blow his nose, freeing him and never knowing it. For now\u2026he just waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta sniffed a bit and let the building drop back down to Earth. With the last bug dealt with, he could get back to business. Still, these new abilities were amazing. Super senses, reality warping, gravity warping, and a voice that could not be refused (although he didn\u2019t know what the limitations of that one was). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just keep getting more awesome with each growth! Maybe I\u2019ll get some muscle next time!\u201d Jinta praised himself as he flexed his huge, but undeveloped bicep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou rock, Lord Jinta! I\u2019m so happy to serve a god like you!\u201d Ichigo shouted up at his master, even though he could hear him even if he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen anything yet, carrot top! The world\u2019s just begun to feel the wrath of Lord Jinta!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta smirked and turned toward the barrier. He walked up to it and poked it with his finer. He could hear it groan massively, like a huge force had pressed against it. Jinta decided to try something. He reached to the side and ripped a hole in reality. He reached his hand into it and watched as his hand appeared on the other side of the barrier. He could easily just step around the barrier and move on...but what fun would that be? He closed the hole up and turned back to the barrier. Pulling his arm back he punched the barrier as hard as he could. A sound like hundreds of windows shattering at the same time filled the air as Jinta's god fist tore into kido barrier like it was wet paper. It was inconceivable to believe that, mere minutes before, Jinta had been unable to break this pathetic excuse for a barrier. He moved a few steps to the right and noticed that he had just destroyed a small portion of it. He grinned and cracked his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jinta continued destroying the barrier in its entirety, just for the fun of it, he was still unaware of the second party that was watching him. Gin grinned at the wonderful show he had been watching and was looking forward to seeing what would happen next. Suddenly, one of the view screens on his right changed from scenes of devastation to one of Sosuke Aizen. Gin grinned up at him and said, \"Yes? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm calling a meeting of the Espada Gin. Please come down to the meeting room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image on the screen disappeared and Gin got to his feet. This should be interesting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the meeting room the Espada were seated around a large table, Aizen at the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've called you all here for the situation in Karakura Town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Situation? What are you talking about?\" Nnoitra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you know?\" Grimmjow said, slouched in his seat and staring into the darkness of the room. \"Some giant human brat is rampaging around the World of the Living.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhispers suddenly erupted down the table as the Espada learned of this news. This was unheard of. \"What exactly does this have to with us?\" Barragan growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apollo...if you would?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo stood from his spot at the table and held up a small vial of a clear, slimy liquid. \"I have been studying the boy tirelessly and have managed to complete this. This is an imperfect form of the substance that altered the boy. It's something I've never seen before, a completely new element. Or perhaps its so rare and old there are no records of it. Either way, with this substance a lifeforms power could be increased several fold. Now, judging by my research, the boy had several times this amount introduced into his system which is why he's grown so fast, so large, and so powerful. However, he was a mere human. If this were to be used, say, on a being with greater spiritual pressure it would have a much greater effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's attention was focused on the vial. Such a powerful thing...each one of them thought of what they could do with power like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only have this one vial of the substance synthesized at the moment. As such, I still need it to study and perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw that!\" Grimmjow shouted, slamming his hand on the table. Everyone turned to look at him in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see that kid? We don't have time to be just sitting around! The longer we wait, the stronger he gets! If I were to take that stuff now I'd definitely get stronger than him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there we come to the real reason you're interrupting.\" Hallibel said. \"You just want it for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why shouldn't I get it?\" Grimmjow asked. \"Are you suggesting every one of you wouldn't take this if you had the chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one said anything. Starrk raised his hand half halfheartedly and said, \"I really don't care...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one paid him any attention. The Espada started arguing amongst themselves, each stating their case about the situation. After the squabbling has gone on for a few minutes Aizen increased his spiritual pressure and everyone turned to face him. \"I happen to agree with Grimmjow. This is a delicate situation. Apollo...when is the earliest you can have the substance perfected?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A day or two at most...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see? In a day or two that boy will no doubt have grown even stronger. We can't take risks with my plan so close to fruition. That's why one of you, the Espada, must take that substance and destroy that boy. But do leave something for Apollo to study. It may prove useful in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was done talking Grimmjow leaped from his seat and grabbed the vial. He moved a few steps away from the table as the other Espada shouted in rage, annoyance, indignation, and surprise. The mad Espada held the vial up between his fingers and grinned at the others. \"Too slow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing just his thumb he popped the top on the vial and downed the slimy liquid inside, tossing the empty bottle over his shoulder and heading for the exit of Los Noches to enter the World of the Living. There was silence among the Espada. Gin broke it by saying, \"Show of hands. Who's actually surprised?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all of this was going on, Jinta was finishing tearing down the last of the barrier, the ceiling falling down on him, shattering on his head and shoulders, most of it missing Hisagi. He dusted his hands and surveyed the area one last time. There was truly nothing left. It was time to move on. He took one step outside of the town when something flew in front of his eyes. He focused in on it and saw that it was a man he had never seen before, with blue hair, and a...hole...in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...you're a Hollow aren't you?\" Jinta asked in his booming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow hadn't been expecting the sheer power in the boy's voice. Seeing him in real life was a totally different experience than seeing him on a viewing screen. But he wasn't about to be intimidated by a kid. He stood his ground and said, \"Listen up brat! I can't have you causing trouble anymore! You're ruining my fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta put his hands on his hips and replied, \"Tough! Why should a god care about what a dust speck thinks? Get out of my way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta raised his hand and folded a piece of reality around Grimmjow, trapping him in a ball of time and space. Jinta grabbed the ball and tossed it in his hands a few times, wondering what he should do with this guy. Judging by the fact that he was humanoid and his mask was almost totally missing, he had to be an Arrancar. That wasn't really all that different from a Soul Reaper. He already had two Soul Reaper slaves, why not add an Arrancar? He looked like he was a fun one too. Hard to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jinta thought this over in his mind, Grimmjow was starting to change inside the ball. The slime had worked its way into his system at last and the change was sure to be drastic.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grimmjow floated inside is prison, waiting for the concoction he drank to kick in. This kid was going to get it for humiliating him like this. A few moments after thinking this, Grimmjow felt a burst of energy inside him. He looked down at himself and watched as the strange slime began to seep out of his body and soak is skin and clothes. It was\u2026kind of gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s weird\u2026\u201d Grimmjow muttered to himself, not liking the idea of being covered in a sticky slime. The liquid disappeared back into his body after drenching him and the blue-haired Arrancar felt his energy spike. His body began to rapidly expand and in no time, it was pressing against the pint-sized sphere. Jinta noticed it too and watched curiously. Was this some strange ability of the Arrancar or was he\u2026growing? Grimmjow grunted in discomfort and was starting to become annoyed with the bubble. He let his spiritual pressure leak out in a single burst, causing the sphere to crack in several places and shatter into pieces. Jinta jumped back in surprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what are you doing?! \u201c Jinta shouted at him. \u201cWhy are you growing? You\u2019re not supposed to be growing! Only I can grow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Think again, you oversized brat.\u201d Grimmjow shouted back as he quickly became as big as the boy\u2019s finger\u2026than his fist\u2026and soon his head. \u201cDid you enjoy playing god? Well, playtime\u2019s over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta only looked on his shock as the Arrancar quickly grew larger and larger, faster than he had. Jinta could deal with the military\u2026the Soul Reapers\u2026even the Arrancar were nothing before him! But now, when someone way out of his league began growing in front of him, even this young god began showing signs of fear. The youthful man\u2019s spiritual pressure was already quickly climbing above his own. It felt heavy and stung like razor blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Grimmjow had grown to half the size of the gargantuan Jinta, he landed his feet on the ground. Fissures appeared along the earth as the Arrancar stepped down. He looked up at Jinta\u2019s face and smirked before bringing his fist back and punching the boy right in the gut. Jinta was fast enough to tense his abdominal muscles to absorb the blow, but it still launched him back a few yards. Blood began trickling from his mouth. Jinta wiped it away and gave the Espada as nasty glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat does it, you\u2019re dead pussy cat!\u201d Jinta warned the older male before he lunged forward and threw his own punch towards Grimmjow chest. The same punch that had shattered the barrier hit the man in the chest hard, but didn\u2019t budge him an inch. Grimmjow\u2019s Hierro could now make his body harder than diamond. The spiky haired Arrancar grabbed Jinta\u2019s fist and, with a grin, lifted the boy over his head and tossed him away. Jinta rolled a few miles away, unable to stop himself. Hisagi held onto Jinta\u2019s shirt for his dear life, while Ichigo was thrown about inside his pocket like a gumball. When Jinta finally stopped, he was sitting on his butt; his clothes covered in dirt. He tried to throw another glare at Grimmjow, but it only lasted a second before turning into another stare of awe. The older man had already reached Jinta\u2019s height and stopped growing, towering over him like he would at normal size. Before Jinta could stand up, Grimmjow was already over him and grabbed Jinta by the throat. Lord Jinta was lifted off the ground, kicking his legs wildly and clawing at his captor\u2019s hand desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, what\u2019s wrong?!\u201d Ichigo yelled up at him. \u201cYou can cream this guy, I know it!\u201d Jinta heard his slave, but couldn\u2019t do anything. He was outmatched and couldn\u2019t speak or breath at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about this, kid, but I don\u2019t show mercy to those that fight me.\u201d Grimmjow chuckled evilly as he slowly began to tighten his grip, aiming to snap the boy\u2019s neck. Jinta started to get light headed and needed to think fast. Using one of his hands, he tore a rip in space across Grimmjow\u2019s wrist. Just as planned, the rip separated the man\u2019s hand from his arm cleanly. Grimmjow screamed in pain and jumped back, his blood raining down on the land below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, that was a close one.\u201d Jinta said with a smirk as he pried Grimmjow\u2019s hand off his neck and tossed it over his shoulder. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll just tear another one in your head and\u2026\u201d Jinta stopped when he noticed the Espada\u2019s arm was starting to bubble. Grimmjow looked just as surprised and watched as a boney hand grew out of his wrist. The bones quickly covered themselves in muscle and skin and the 6th Espada had his hand back in a matter of seconds. Grimmjow flexed his fingers a bit before looking back at Jinta with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I have some new tricks too. Speaking of which, that reality warping power of yours is pretty neat, but can you do this?\u201d the Arrancar asked before showing Jinta his open palm and started to collect red energy into it. Jinta knew what was coming and prepared for it. The 6th Espada fired his Cero at the other giant and watched as everything in front of him was consumed in a bright red explosion. The destruction was on par with a nuclear blast\u2026maybe even greater. When the explosion ended, it left behind a dust cloud that wasn\u2019t going to clear up anytime soon. Grimmjow took a few sniffs of the air and appeared displeased. He couldn\u2019t smell the boy\u2019s burnt corpse, which meant he was still alive somewhere. Where had that brat gone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral miles away, a large hole appeared and Jinta\u2019s titanic form fell out of it, hitting the ground and crushing every tree and piece of land underneath him. The boy covered his mouth and coughed a bit, having avoided the Cero but been hit by some of the backlash. He had to think fast, though, that Arrancar was going to find him soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy every time I become more godly, something always gets in my way!? I have to think of something or else I\u2019m finished. Come on Jinta\u2026use your head!\u201d the boy tugged at is hair as he tried to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026Lord Jinta\u2026\u201d Ichigo muttered in a quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d Jinta shouted, almost scaring Ichigo right back into the bottom of his pocket. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to listen to you, carrot top!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026I think I have an idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Well in that case, spit it out already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026you can manipulate space and time, right? And you just created a hole big enough to fit your entire body through, right? Well, why not do that again\u2026but this time make Grimmjow fall through it! As long as he doesn\u2019t have reality warping powers like you, he\u2019ll get trapped in the void!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta blinked a few times before a smile spread across his face. With a change of tone, he said, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea at all! If it works, carrot top, you earned yourself a big time reward!\u201d Jinta then looked over at his shoulder and glared at Hisagi, who was still gripping Jinta\u2019s shirt like a frightened insect. \u201cAnd you just remain useless, huh? At this rate, you\u2019ll never catch up to carrot top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi didn\u2019t say anything and just looked away from Jinta. Even though the Arrancars were their enemies, he silently wished this one would crush Jinta. The boy deserved it. All three of the boys\u2019 thoughts were interrupted as they felt a massive spiritual pressure approach them\u2026he was coming.  </span></div></div>",

This Arrancar would probably tear him to shreds with a smile on his face. But there was no way Jinta would let that happen! He was the only god around here! And like a true god he would dispose of any usurpers and pretenders. Grimmjow was still a ways away. He was clearly taking his time, enjoying this game that was occurring between the two of them. Jinta quickly surveyed the area. He would wait until the time was right and then open a hole in space nearby.There was no way the Arrancar was going to fall for a trap, so he was going to have to physically shove him in. He could do it. He was God Jinta after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know kid, watching you destroy this town and enslave those pathetic Soul Reapers was really something. I can admit that. But, when we get right down to it, you're still just a bratty little kid! I'm going to enjoy ripping you to pieces!\" Grimmjow said all this as soon as he was within talking distance. At the last word he suddenly charged forward and kicked Jinta. Jinta couldn't react fast enough and was sent flying away, tearing into the ground as he rolled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...wasn't ready for that one...\" Jinta muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so pathetic! Some god!\" Grimmjow laughed and continued pursuing the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta waited until Grimmjow got close and then swiped at him with his reality warping powers. Grimmjow dodged at the last second and only ended up losing a chunk of his stomach. He didn't seem to notice it as it quickly reformed. He was about to kick Jinta again when Jinta altered gravity and his kick went far too high. Jinta took this opportunity to cut his other leg at the knee. Grimmjow quickly fell over, blood pouring from his wound, as Jinta jumped to his feet and began slicing chunks of the Arrancar off left and right. Soon, only a bloody pile was left on the ground. However, Jinta could already see the fleshy mass starting to reform. Jinta had done this on purpose. He knew it wouldn't keep the Arrancar down for long but he hoped it would make him angry enough to do something stupid...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Grimmjow as getting to his feet, his normally white clothes stained with blood. He was absolutely furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it...I'm done playing around with you kid! Now you're dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe charged forward and Jinta quickly grabbed reality with both hands and tore downward. A huge hole ripped right in front of him. Grimmjow, not knowing what the strange void in front of him was, ran straight into it thinking it was an energy attack of some kind that he could just bat out of the way. He was shocked when he suddenly found himself in an infinite blackness that stretched into eternity. Jinta quickly recreated reality until only a small hole was left. He looked through it and laughed at Grimmjow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some fighter you are! Falling for a simple trick like this! Now you're trapped forever in the space between reality!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow ran up to the hole and shouted, \"You damn brat! Let me out of here! I'll kill you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta laughed at him and said, \"You're in no position to threaten me buddy! But look on the bright side. Maybe I'll come back for you...when I'm an even bigger, stronger, and totally unstoppable GOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he shouted god he slammed shut the hole in reality, trapping the impulsive Espada completely. Jinta dusted his hands and grinned at the empty space. His biggest challenge yet was now trapped in an empty, boundless void. This was just proof that nothing was greater than he was. No matter what rose to oppose him he would strike it down just like a true god would!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Lord Jinta that was amazing! I knew you could do it!\" Ichigo praised his god from the pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta picked his obedient slave up and brought him to his face. \"You served your god well carrot top! That idea was perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo blushed and stuttered, \"I-I just thought it might work...my idea would have been pointless if you weren't so powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be that as it may, you're still my most loyal and useful slave! Unlike some people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta glared at Hisagi who flinched at the intensity of the stare. His knees were actually shaking. Jinta kept that pants wetting stare fixed on him for awhile before turning kind eyes back on Ichigo. Hisagi gasped and coughed, realizing that he had been holding his breath the entire time Jinta was staring at him. His will was being destroyed little by little. It was getting to be just too much work to oppose Jinta when he was forced to reside on his body. But he didn't want to turn into a simpering, demure, pet either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta looked Ichigo over and said, \"Well I'm benevolent god carrot top so I'm going to give you a reward! Are you ready for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo got down on his hands and knees and bowed to Jinta's massive face. \"It's more than I deserve Lord Jinta. I will accept anything you give me as a gift greater than my own life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why I like you so much carrot top. You know just what to say!\" Jinta laughed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta looked around and tried to think of a good reward for his little slave. What exactly do you give a tiny speck? Jinta scratched his chin, thinking it over and trying to come up with something. Ichigo saw that his god was having trouble, and just over something insignificant as himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord Jinta, if you can\u2019t think of anything, it\u2019s fine. Just serving you is a reward in itself!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, carrot top.\u201d Jinta told his slave, grinning down at him. \u201cYou saved me back there, so you deserve something else other than serving my godly being.\u201d Jinta paused for a moment as a light bulb went on in his head. \u201cGodly being\u2026me\u2026hmmm, I wonder\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked puzzled as Jinta started to approach the ruins of Karakura Town. Jinta knelt by the edge of the town and placed Ichigo on his shoulder next to Hisagi. Jinta placed both his hands against the ground and pressed down, crushing anything and everything underneath them. The boy began to concentrate as he began to manipulate reality again. He wasn\u2019t tearing it, though, but changing it like he changed the space around Grimmjow into a sphere. Slowly, everything around his hands began to shift inward. Stone, metal, wood, glass, water\u2026everything bonded together into a thick, molten liquid that flowed toward the space between Jinta\u2019s hands. Ichigo and Hisagi watched in awe at this miracle\u2026a miracle of God. The new material started to rise and take on a new shape. Karakura Town was being used to create something else\u2026something better than it ever could have been. When Jinta was finally finished, half of the destroyed town was gone and replaced with barren wasteland. Its very existence was used to make\u2026this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jinta stood a giant statue of himself, reaching up to the boy\u2019s waist. Despite being made of many different materials, it took on a shiny, chrome-like appearance. The statue was striking a victory-pose; one of its fists pumped into the air. Underneath one of its feet was the defeated form of Grimmjow. Next to the Jinta statue was another statue, this one smaller and in the likeness of Ichigo. It stood up to the bigger statue\u2019s ankle and was striking a similar pose. Jinta removed Ichigo from his shoulder and placed him in front of the statues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked up in amazement at the sculptures. The one of him was marvelous and brought a smile to the boy\u2019s face, but he knew the statue of Jinta was far superior in every way. He didn\u2019t deserve to stand next to his God like that. As Ichigo looked over both figures, he noticed a small detail near his own statue. Underneath its foot was the human-sized model of Hisagi, who seemed to be struggling under the weight of the teen\u2019s giant form. This made Ichigo want to burst out into laugher, but resisted as not to make his master think he was laughing at the statue itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, Lord Jinta! Thank you! Nothing better deserves to be built here!\u201d Ichigo shouted up, praising his master further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you like it, carrot top. I\u2019m a pretty good artist, if I do say so myself.\u201d Jinta said, stroking his own ego. The red head picked Ichigo back up and placed him his pocket one again. \u201cAnyway, I hope that\u2019s the last distraction for awhile. It\u2019s time to get back to business!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta scanned over the horizon and made out what looked like another town in the distance. It would be the next victim of his divine rampage. Looking up at the sky, Jinta noticed it was starting to show signs of night. If he went now, he may be able to cause a bit of chaos before resting for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026then again, that battle with the Arrancar had left Jinta with a dirty feeling. His clothes, face, arms, feet\u2026everything was stained with mud and the Arrancar\u2019s blood. He was a god and gods were prefect. They weren\u2019t supposed to look like homeless people who looked like they just came from a brawl. Though\u2026how do gods bathe and wash their clothes?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta looked around and his eyes fell on the ocean. At this point, it was the only nearby body of water that would be big enough for him to submerge himself in. He didn't have any soap or shampoo to clean himself with, but he could at least wash the blood and dirt off of his body. He lumbered over to the beach and grabbed Hisagi off his shoulder and fished Ichigo out of his pocket and brought them up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up slaves! I'm going to go wash myself off in the water. You can too if you want but when I'm done, you're done, so don't dawdle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set them both down by the edge of the water and started stripping. His shirt, pants, and underwear all went flying onto the rubble of the city, leaving the boy god in all his naked glory. He stepped into the water, his slightest movements making huge waves that rolled into the shore. Before they could undress Ichigo and Hisagi found themselves floating out into the ruins of the city before undertow yanked them back towards Jinta's body. Jinta waded out until he was waist deep in the water and bent down, running water all over his body. He paid special attention to his feet which were absolutely filthy. He scrubbed between the toes and thought, \"When I get more slaves, they're all going to do this for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jinta washed himself Ichigo and Hisagi were caught up in a maelstrom of water. Jinta's slightest movement caused the waters to churn and swirl, dragging the two Soul Reapers around, occasionally bumping into Jinta's massive form. The sweat, dirt, and blood from their own bodies was washed away but the experience was draining away their energy, and Hisagi didn't have much energy left as it was. Jinta suddenly ducked under the water, his descending body dragging both teens down, down, down into the depths of the water. Jinta ran his hands through his hair and made sure all the grime was gone. He rose up out of the water like some primordial monster and Hisagi and Ichigo were dragged up with him, breaking the surface with loud gasps and moans. Jinta, of course, heard all this and smirked down at his slaves. It was all part of his plan to break Hisagi. The stubborn sixty nine face had to be getting ready to submit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow done cleaning himself, Jinta scooped up his slaves and walked back to short. His little dip into the ocean had caused massive flooding in what was once Karakura Town, submerging his statue somewhat. He didn't like that. He put his hands into the water and, using his reality warping powers, drew all the water back into the ocean. He then drew all the salt and residues off his statue until it was gleaming like new again and Jinta was left holding a sphere of filth. He tore open a small hole in space and tossed it in before turning to his clothes. He grabbed them up and scrubbed them in the water, removing all sweat stains, blood, and dirt. Once that was done, put his soaking wet clothes on, after setting Ichigo and Hisagi down by his feet where his enormous body dripped all over them, and drew all the salt and water out of his clothes and off his body until he had a large ball of salt water. He tossed this into the ocean where it rejoined with the ocean. Now dry and clean, Jinta picked up his slaves and examined them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are soaked too, huh? Here let me get that for you.\" He swiftly removed the water from Ichigo's clothes and body and tossed it into the ocean. He frowned down at Hisagi and said, \"You can stay soaked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped Hisagi onto his shoulder again, and gently placed Ichigo in his pocket. He turned to the other town in the distance and said, \"Time to move on!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The townsfolk were just wrapping up their day. Some were heading home after shopping, others leaving work to be with their families. The day had been filled with slight tremors and loud noises, but the arrogant mortals didn\u2019t think much of it. When the ground started to shake again, the citizens looked around once more for an explanation. Then they saw it moments before it was too late. The humongous form of a red-haired child, miles high, stepped over a nearby mountainside and into their precious town. The boy\u2019s large feet crushed any buildings under them into nothingness, killing hundreds in the process. Jinta grinned and folded his arms across his chest while he eyes gleamed down at the thousands of new victims. People were already trying to flee, running or driving away from his looming form. Chaos had already begun, and Jinta hadn\u2019t even been here a full minute yet. When Jinta noticed the insects were trying to escape, he merely grinned wider and slammed his fist into the ground by his feet. Instead of creating an explosion and devastating the entire town, the force of the punch seemed to be absorbed into the ground and spread outward. The specks below felt the energy flow past them as it made its way to the outskirts of the city. Once in place, the earth around the city burst open and walls of stone surrounded the entire settlement. The city, and its inhabitants, were locked in with no means of escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, bugs, but there won\u2019t be an evacuation this time! Your lives are over; you serve Lord Jinta now, your new God!\u201d Jinta declared. He watched as groups of people started to form below him. Streets all around him were filled with tiny little specks. They all strained their necks and looked up at the giant being, shocked that something so big could be alive. Jinta smirked as he listened to all of them murmur. Some were talking amongst themselves, others were breaking into tears. Some even prayed to some God Jinta knew wasn\u2019t going to help them. The titan hovered his left bare foot over a street and held it so that an entire group of people were just inches below it. Many buildings were easily pushed aside to make room for it, some even collapsing on the gatherers. \u201cFor your first act of devotion: kiss my foot!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe townsfolk did nothing; only stared up at Jinta\u2019s looming sole. They were too frightened and too confused to do a thing. Jinta scowled as he boomed, \u201cNot gonna do it, eh? Fine by me\u2026I like feeling you specks squish under my foot!\u201d Without giving his slaves the chance to process what he said, Jinta pressed his foot into the ground and ended a couple hundred more lives. He swung his foot over and held it over another street full of worshippers. \u201cYou know what to do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the townsfolk complied and began kissing their new deity\u2019s foot. Even if it was over a hundred people, most of Jinta\u2019s sole remained un-kissed. It was just too large and the mortals were just too small and insignificant. As Jinta took in the attention he was getting, he felt more tiny bugs kissing his other foot. Some brave insects even started climbing Jinta\u2019s foot and kissing it. The boy giant was amazed at how easily mere humans could be intimidated and broken. As he enjoyed his worship, his superhuman sight noticed some small flashes coming from some of the buildings around him. Kids had rushed to the rooftops and began snapping photos of the giant boy. Jinta just smiled down at them and posed for the pictures. He threw up some peace signs, gave a few thumbs up, and even flexed a bit. Anything to make him look like the world\u2019s newest (and greatest) celebrity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough.\u201d Jinta said after awhile. He removed his left foot from his slaves and shook the devoted ones off his right, accidentally flinging many to their dooms. He looked around him and noticed that the town\u2019s entire population still hadn\u2019t gathered before him. Many were still hiding in buildings or driving through the streets looking for an exit. The question was: what to do with such disloyal slaves?</span></div></div>",

To the tiny people below it was as rumbling as distant thunder. Jinta smacked his lips tiredly and noticed that it was getting pretty dark. It had been a long day and Jinta was tired. He looked down at the specks milling around his feet and said, \"I'm too tired to deal with you punks right now. Mark my words, though, tomorrow morning, bright and early, those of you who oppose me, are disloyal to me, or try to escape from me will be severely punished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe emphasized his remarks by slamming his fist into his open palm. Everyone got the picture quite clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta yawned again and stretched his young muscles out, grabbing Hisagi and Ichigo in his hand. With his other hand he pulled his shirt off and folded it into a neat square, putting it on his chest as he lay down and putting Ichigo onto the shirt. Ichigo snuggled into the material and was almost instantly asleep. He was exhausted after the days events. Hisagi, however, wasn't so lucky. Jinta plucked him up and held him above his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen you. You've been nothing more than a useless pain in my ass this whole day. I'm giving you one more chance. Tomorrow, if you don't do anything useful to help your god, I'll end your miserable life. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi nodded, getting the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now I can't trust you sleeping out in the open so I've got an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed his hand against the ground and pulled a tiny amount of a sticky substance from it. It seemed to be a mixture of sap, mud, and other natural adhesives. He stuck it to Hisagi's feet and dropped the tiny Soul Reaper into his belly button. Hisagi fell for what felt like forever before he landed, feet first, at the bottom. He tried to free himself desperately, but it was no good. He was trapped inside the boy titan's belly button. It was huge and expansive, like being trapped inside an enormous canyon. The sounds of the boy's stomach was amplified, the entire area filled with the gurgling and growling of the boy's belly. Jinta laughed as he felt Hisagi stick. Not too long ago only a single person had been able to fit in there, and that was doubled over. Now he could fit hundreds, maybe more, inside. He was just getting greater and greater, his ego swelling with every passing minute. It was hard to believe he had ever counted himself among the specks at his feet. He put his arms behind his head and sighed in pleasure, falling asleep rather quickly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even if Jinta was an almighty god, he slept like a baby. As Jinta and Ichigo (as well as Hisagi, if the sounds of the stomach didn\u2019t keep him up) slept, none of them were aware that they were being watched. On top of a nearby cliffside overlooking the town, a middle aged man wearing a bucket hat watched the giant boy sleep. He witnessed the boy snore lightly as a thick tendril of drool dripped into the town, partially flooding the streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe always had such annoying sleeping habits.\u201d the man said before frowning and covering his eyes with his hat, as if mourning. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame it came to this, but I suppose it\u2019s my fault for leaving that experimental slime in the shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t show any sympathy for that monster. Do you know how much he\u2019s done within the course of a day?\u201d spoke another man from behind Kisuke. He stood with a third figure, who was reasonably shorter than him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m aware of that, but there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d Kisuke replied as he turned to face his two accomplices. \u201cThat mixture was meant to turn even the most average of people into a fully functional god. It was meant to be a back up plan if anything terribly wrong happened to the world. For that reason, Jinta possesses not only the ability to destroy\u2026but someday may even possess the power to create.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou expect him to just redo everything he did and apologize afterward? Get real!\u201d raised the voice of the shorter figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d Urahara said with a chuckle before taking out two vials from his coat containing the mysterious slime. Unlike the slime in his shop or the sample Aporro created, these vials glowed with an eerie light. He jiggled them between is fingers as he smirked. \u201cI expect you two to set everything right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two figures stepped out of the shadows that were concealing their identity up till now. They were none other than the presumed deceased Soul Reapers, Toshiro Hitsugaya and Renji Abarai. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, Urahara, we\u2019re thankful that you saved us and we haven\u2019t contacted Soul Society like you asked, but you can\u2019t seriously being thinking of turning us into gods. No one should have that power.\u201d objected Renji with a look of concern on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd yet that brat behind me does.\u201d Kisuke pointed a thumb at the sleeping Jinta. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to ask this, but it\u2019s up to you to clean up his mess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Soul Reapers looked at each other and nodded. There wasn\u2019t much of a choice. Hitsugaya spoke for the both of them as he said, \u201cVery well, but you can reverse the effects, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, though I don\u2019t see why you\u2019d want to\u2026\u201d Kisuke muttered the last part before tossing the two vials at the younger men. The two caught them and gulped the contents down instantly. Both their faces turned green as they covered their mouths in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026when does this stuff start to kick in, anyway?\u201d Renji asked as he started coughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a more advanced form of the original Jinta used, but it\u2019ll take longer to work through your system. It could be tomorrow or a few days from now. When it does kick in, you\u2019ll possess all the powers Jinta has and then some. You\u2019ll also be able to control your size at will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we just wait while that brat plays with people like toys and gets stronger? What if he gets so big that he ruins the Earth with a single step? We\u2018ll be dead before we can act!\u201d Renji clenched his fist in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ll be waiting in Soul Society, away form Jinta and his destruction.\u201d Kisuke answered as he waved his hand and summoned a gate behind the Soul Reapers. \u201cBesides, Jinta\u2019s accession into godhood won\u2019t be without its roadblocks. I\u2019m sure there will be many who\u2019ll try and obstruct his path. One may even be rearing its ugly head soon\u2026\u201d Kisuke finished speaking and followed the two high-ranking Soul Reapers into the gate, leaving Jinta and his slaves behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, with Jinta and co., Ichigo was not having a comfortable sleep. The teen tossed and turned within Jinta\u2019s shirt, sweating heavily and squeezing his eye shut as if having a nightmare. When his eyes shot opened, he was met with a clear blue sky. Refusing to believe it was daytime alright, Ichigo stood up and realized he was standing in his inner world. As he stood on the tilted skyscraper, he suddenly felt a leg smack into his stomach and send him flying backwards. Ichigo stopped himself from rolling off the skyscraper and glared at his white doppelganger. His inner Hollow pointed a white finger at the teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve become weak, Kurosaki!\u201d shouted the Hollow with a corrupted version of his own voice. \u201cEver since submitting to that brat, you\u2019ve become weak as shit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s this or dying!\u201d Ichigo shouted back. \u201cLiving as Lord Jinta\u2019s servant is the only thing for me now. I couldn\u2019t wish for anything better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo\u2019s Hollow frowned as he muttered, \u201cPitiful.\u201d and turned the frown into a mad smile. \u201cI refuse to work under such a pitiful \u2019king\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do, then? Fight him? You\u2019ll be squashed like a grape!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably, but so will you because we INHABIT THE SAME BODY, DUMBASS!!\u201d Hollow Ichigo screamed at Ichigo. The orange-haired boy widened his eyes a bit. He had a point there. He watched as his white clone placed his arm by his side and pull Zangetsu out of thin air. Even his sword seemed to be sick with him. \u201cI\u2019m going to take over your body and then hightail it out of here! Jinta can try and stop me, but he\u2019ll have to kill both of us to do so!\u201d Ichigo was starting to show signs of fear as Hollow Ichigo pointed his blade at him. \u201cJust hold still, taking over your body when you\u2019re this weak with be a piece of cake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked on fearfully as his inner Hollow rushed at him, laughing like a madman with sword in hand. </span></div></div>",

Normally he would jump up and fight back, taking everything from his Inner Hollow and banishing his presence to the back of his mind. But now, after giving so much to Jinta, he had nothing left for himself. He lived for Jinta and now was going to die because he couldn't have the will to defend himself. The last thought that crossed his mind as his Inner Hollow got closer was, \"Please protect me Lord Jinta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA violent explosion appeared in between Ichigo and his rampaging Inner Hollow, forcing the latter back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What the hell is this?\" the manic creature questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge...something was now separating the two boys, a something that looked somehow familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the huge object moved, rising into the air, splitting the building in half. Ichigo gaped up as he watched the creature that had been minutes away from killing him and taking over his body getting carried away into the sky. His eye strayed slightly downward and he saw a great white expanse that definitely wasn't a cloud...and below that a massive area of blue with no clouds in it, so it couldn't be sky...and further up there was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey carrot top! I heard you calling and came to help ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Jinta! H-how--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be a very good god if I couldn't protect my faithful worshipers and slaves! Now sit back and let me take care of this clown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo did as he was told and sat down obediently, smiling up at his god. Jinta brought the tiny white speck up to his eyes and said, \"So, you've been messing around with slave's head huh? We can't have that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! You fool! I don't care how big you are! I'm not going to lay down and submit to you! Now DIE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta watched in amusement as the creature charged at him, swinging his sword above his head. Jinta calmly blew a small wave of air at him which pushed the Inner Hollow down, swiftly, towards the ground. Before he reached it Jinta raised his foot and kicked him like a tiny hacky sack which sent him flying up to Jinta's chest. Jinta waited until he was at the peak of the rise and then smashed him with his fist. He did this back and forth for awhile until he got bored. He picked the Inner Hollow out of the hole had had made in the concrete and held him up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you little germ, listen up! You're not going to do anything to harm my little slave ever again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature laughed feebly and said, \"You can't do anything to me...I'll still be here...even when you're gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta smirked and said, \"Yeah, that would be true if you were dealing with a mortal. But watch THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta warped reality until a sphere surrounded the Inner Hollow until he was totally trapped. The then dropped the sphere and warped reality around it in a bigger sphere. He did this again, and again, and again, until, in place of one of the skyscrapers, there was an enormous ball of bent reality. Jinta dusted his hands and looked down at Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go carrot top! He won't be bothering you anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo got on his hands and knees again and said, \"Thank you Lord Jinta! I can't express how thankful I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta put his arms behind his head and said, \"Heh, it was no trouble for a guy like me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Jinta...if I may ask a question...\" Ichigo said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! What's on your mind carrot top?\" Jinta asked, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get in here? This is a world that exists in my mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, we're both asleep right? I just heard you say you wanted me to protect you so I broke through reality and found myself in this dinky little city. Finding you was a piece of cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo was incredibly impressed. His master had heard him, not speaking, but thinking in another dimension and had come to save him. His devotion to the boy continued rising. Jinta scooped up Ichigo in his hand and said, \"Come on, let's get out of here. I need to get my rest for tomorrows conquest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded eagerly and gazed up at Jinta, devotion evident on his face. Jinta reached out with his other hand and opened a huge hole in reality. After stepping through it, Ichigo felt his mind snap off like someone turned out a light. He would remember this event when he woke in the morning, but for now, he was at peace. Jinta wasn't quite the same. He was still asleep, but was aware. At any moment he could spring into action though, to the outside eye, he appeared to be deeply asleep. His omniscience as a god was slowly growing along with his body. Soon, he would be indisputable...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta and his two main slaves slept peacefully during the night. Even Hisagi was eventually lulled to sleep by the gurgling of Jinta\u2019s stomach. The rest of the slaves, however, had a restless night. They were constantly kept awake by their god\u2019s snoring. The waterfall of droll that lasted most of the night flooded several of the streets, forcing many to find new spots to rest. When they finally did manage to fall asleep, it was already morning and Jinta was ready to get up. The young god blinked his eyes open and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes while yawning loudly. The yawn acted like an oversized alarm clock that signaled everyone, including Ichigo and Hisagi, to wake up. As Jinta smacked his lips together, he glanced down at Ichigo on his chest. The orange head smiled up at his master, a look Jinta knew was another way of showing how thankful he was to his god for saving him last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSleep well, carrot top?\u201d Jinta asked as he leaned up a bit and scratched his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded in response and said, \u201cYour shirt is so comfy, it was like being in heaven.\u201d Ichigo hugged the white fabric to emphasize his point. He knew he couldn\u2019t cling to it forever, though, and allowed Jinta to pluck him off it so the giant could stand up and stretch. He deposited Ichigo back into his pants pocket and was about to pull his shirt over his head when another voice echoed from his navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about me? Aren\u2019t you going to take me out?!\u201d Hisagi asked desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot when you ask like that.\u201d was Jinta\u2019s reply as he covered himself with his white shirt and enveloped Hisagi in darkness. Jinta looked down at his other slaves, who were just starting to wake up. \u201cListen up, bugs! I\u2019m going to go punish the disobedient slaves form last night. I expect all of you to be up and ready by the time I\u2019m done. Anyone still sleeping will find themselves waking up in the afterlife!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his order given, Jinta left his slaves and started to march through town. His eyes traveled down to the streets where many cars were still moving. They must have been up all night trying to find an escape route. What a waste of their last moments\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrying to find a way out? I\u2019ll show you one!\u201d Jinta bellowed a she reached down and scooped up a bunch of vehicles and people-occupied buildings. He brought them to his face and licked his lips hungrily. \u201cBreakfast time!\u201d The hundreds of scared individuals looked on helplessly as Jinta opened his maw wide and threw the handful into it. When everything was resting on his pink tongue, Jinta slammed his jaws shut and started munching and chewing discriminately. Jinta reared his head back and swallowed, sending everything down to his empty gut. The boy grinned and rubbed his stomach. \u201cThat\u2019s another duty of you slaves: feeding me!\u201d Jinta went on to grab several more handfuls and repeat the process until he was satisfied\u2026for now. The spiky red head felt a burp coming up from his stomach, but instead of releasing it into the air, he knelt down and unleashed it on the city below. The sound waves emitted from his gaping mouth tore the defenseless town apart. When he was finished, his vocals had reduced a large section of the town to a barren wilderness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm\u2026that was good.\u201d Jinta complimented himself before turning his attention to his pocketed slave. \u201cYou hungry, carrot top?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded and Jinta scanned the ground for somewhere that served breakfast. He spotted a caf\u00e9 and placed his hand over it. Using his powers, the caf\u00e9 was completely broken down and left behind only its food items. Jinta took a bit of it and dropped it into his pocket, where Ichigo began to chow down happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026Jinta?\u201d Hisagi mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean\u2026Lord Jinta.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, sixty nine man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I\u2026please have some food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since you asked so nicely\u2026\u201d Jinta looked over his palm for any leftover pieces and spotted half a bagel. He pinched the tiny object between his fingers, lifted his shirt up, and flicked the bagel into his bellybutton. It smacked right into Hisagi\u2019s face, who groaned in detest before taking the \u201cgift\u201d and eating it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his two servants fed, Jinta looked around for more bad slaves to punish. He spotted several cars trying to cross a bridge to the other side of town. Jinta stopped over there until the tiny passage was between his legs. Using a single finger, Jinta pressed down on the middle of the bridge and split it in two. Many cars kept on driving, either flying off the bridge or smashing into the titan\u2019s skin. As Jinta watched this happen, his ears picked up the sound of a ship in the distance. Looking left, he noticed the town was also connected to the ocean, and his stone wall hadn\u2019t blocked it off. Three ships were trying to sail to freedom, and Jinta didn\u2019t like that very much. He ripped a hole in reality and pressed his face up to it. Another hole opened directly below the three ships, underwater. The rest was simple. Jinta began to drink the water, sucking up the ships in a whirlpool and sending them down his gullet. He didn\u2019t seem to mind the taste of salt water at all. When he was done, he closed up the holes and wiped some water off his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaahh\u2026well, I think that\u2019s enough for now.\u201d Jinta strolled back over to where his slaves were waiting. He faced the destruction he caused and shouted loudly, \u201cAny survivors who\u2019ve learned their lesson, get over here NOW!\u201d As if having been waiting for that very command, many people rushed out of their hiding spots and joined the other townsfolk around Jinta. Many cars in the distance changed their direction and drove toward the giant god. When his amount of worshipers had almost doubled, Jinta spoke down to them again. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you specks to show your devotion again! Now\u2026what can I have you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta crossed his arms and started to think. However, he must still be tired, because no matter how hard he tried he couldn\u2019t think of a damn thing other than foot worship, which he had already been given last night. He was about to ask carrot top for a suggestion when another idea popped into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, sixty nine man!\u201d Jinta shouted at his stomach. This caused many of his slaves to look at him with puzzled expressions. Why exactly was he talking to his stomach? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Hisagi asked disrespectfully. Jinta was still annoyed by Hisagi\u2019s level of resistance, but ignored it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s your chance at lasting another day: I can\u2019t think of anything these slaves can do, so think of something for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi didn\u2019t know what to say. He was being asked to pick a torture for thousands of people. How was he supposed to think up something like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you can\u2019t think of anything, I\u2019ll just ask carrot top. However, keep in mind that your god doesn\u2019t ask for help that often. This might be your only chance at helping me before the day ends. What\u2019s it going to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a simple enough deal: his life for the suffering of thousands. Hisagi didn\u2019t want to die by this kid\u2019s hand, but he had taken an oath to protect the humans of the living world. Perhaps another chance at helping Jinta would come up\u2026or maybe not. Even if one did, who\u2019s to say it won\u2019t be even WORSE. </span></div></div>",

He closed his eyes and was about to whisper an apology to the people he was about to betray when he realized that Jinta would hear him. He didn't want to give that monster the satisfaction of knowing how much this was affecting him so he simply said, \"Alright, I'll come up with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta smirked and said, \"Good boy. Don't be too long though. I'm not feeling very patient this morning. You've got thirty seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi's mind raced as he tried to come up with an idea. Jinta had already had his foot worshiped last night so he wasn't interested in that. He had already eaten so he wasn't hungry so he couldn't suggest that. Maybe there was a way they could bring pleasure to Jinta...but how? Hisagi was loathe to suggest anything sexual. He didn't want to subject hundreds of people to trying to please the monster that was hidden in Jinta's pants. Boy or not, when you're Jinta's size you had genitals that commanded respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tick tock sixty nine face!\" Jinta said dangerously. \"Ten seconds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi suddenly blurted out, \"Why not have them massage your body Lord Jinta? You must be sore after so much activity yesterday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta thought about it for a moment. He experimentally rolled his shoulders and bent over testing his back. He lifted his legs and rolled his feet before standing still again with his hands on his hips. \"Now that you mention it bug boy I am feeling a little stiff. That's a pretty good idea. Not as good as carrot top's have been but you're getting there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta whipped off his shirt again and pointed at his new slaves. \"Alright you little specks! Listen up! You're going to be massaging your god's body until I'm satisfied! We'll start you off small with my lower back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he laid himself out on the ground he pulled Ichigo out of his pocket and forcibly removed Hisagi from his navel with his powers. With both specks in his hands he said, \"Don't think you two are exempt from this. You're still my slaves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo got down on his hands and knees and replied, \"Of course Lord Jinta! I wouldn't have it any other way! My time is most valuable when it's used serving you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta nodded and glared at Hisagi who just said, \"Yeah, I figured you'd force us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta focused on Ichigo again and said, \"Hey carrot top! Keep an eye on sixty nine man and make sure he's constantly working! If he's not, alert me and I'll punish him good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo got to his feet and saluted. \"Of course Lord Jinta! As you command!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Jinta got down on his stomach and dropped Ichigo and Hisagi on his lower back. Instantly Ichigo got down and started rubbing, his hands kneading into Jinta's skin as best he could. Hisagi followed suit, much more reluctantly. Jinta held his hand out over his new worshipers and the frightened crowd began screaming in terror as they felt their bodies being dragged upward by Jinta's power. Soon, he had all of his slaves in the palm of his hand. He unceremoniously dumped the slaves onto his lower back, using his powers to make sure none of them died on the way down. With that done, he sighed and buried his head in his arms, closing his eyes. All of the people on his lower back started rubbing, spreading out over the huge expanse of the boy's flesh. Jinta could feel them all scurrying like fleas, doing whatever they could to please him, their tiny hands working his back over. It actually was quite soothing. Hisagi attempted to slack off and slip away undetected but Ichigo kept close to him like a guard dog. Whenever it looked like Hisagi was about to sprint Ichigo would grab him by the arm and force him back down. Once, Ichigo had to tackle the other Soul Reaper to keep him working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Jinta felt his back loosen up and he levitated his slaves back into his palm. He sat up and said, \"So far, so good. Now for my arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe separated the people into two groups, making sure to keep Ichigo and Hisagi in the same group, and deposited half of them on the inside of each elbow, at the base of his biceps.He stared up into the blue sky as he felt the tiny people spread out over his bicep and forearms, massaging the massive muscles there. Well, massive in size, not definition. By this time the slaves were already starting to feel pretty tired. Massaging a god was tough work and Jinta was being relentless. After they were done massaging his arms he moved them to his shoulders. After that, he moved them to his calves and then his ankles, before ending with his feet. Once all was said and done the slaves were exhausted, their limbs shaking from all the work they had to do. Ichigo and Hisagi were better  off, but not by much. Ichigo was the only one who was in a good mood. Jinta gathered all his slaves into his palm again and said, \"Not bad specks, not bad at all. You surprised me with your work today. Especially you carrot top. Way to keep sixty nine face in line!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo blushed at the compliment and just nodded. Hisagi rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta fished Ichigo out from the crowd and put him back into his pocket. He also grabbed Hisagi and dropped him on his shoulder. \"Since you came up with the idea I won't shove you back inside my belly button but you're still on probation as far as I'm concerned...but I won't kill you at the end of today either way. Tomorrow though, I can't make the same promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi sighed a little in relief. It wasn't much, but he was alive for another day. Jinta turned his eye on the rest of the population of slaves in his palm and said, \"As for the rest of you...you're all expendable. That's the way it goes with God Jinta. Deal with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe townspeople were too tired to do much except weep and moan at their awful fortune. Jinta scratched his chin as he decided whether or not he should use his slaves again for something else, or just dispose of them and move on. There was an entire world of people out there. Then again, if he kept killing his slaves there would be no one left to worship him except Ichigo and Hisagi. He deposited them safely back into their town and said, \"I've decided to spare your lives since you were all faithful worshipers. This doesn't mean I'm going to go out of my way to protect you though. Soon enough I'll be too big to worry about what a bunch of germs are doing milling around my feet. But until then you have the privilege of seeing your god dominate the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jinta scanned the horizon for his next conquest. </span></div></div>",

That wall was still up, so they couldn\u2019t flee unless someone came to rescue them or they took another ship out to sea. None of it mattered, though, because this town knew more than any other that nowhere was safe from God Jinta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jinta stepped over his makeshift wall, he checked around for his next destination. To his surprise, he spotted evidence of three more cities in three different directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, at this rate, Japan will surrender to me in no time. I wonder if they know how to contact a god\u2026\u201d Jinta laughed as chose one of the cities and headed for it. A few steps later, Jinta suddenly stopped in the middle of a clearing. So far, the day had been great, but something was still nagging him in the back of his mind. That thing was a bug and its name was sixty nine man. Jinta glared over at his shoulder at Hisagi, who had been looking into the distance. When the Soul Reaper noticed they had stopped moving, he looked up at Jinta to meet that menacing glare. The teenaged-looking man started to sweat a bit as he backed away from the humongous face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what? Why are you l-looking at m-me? Did I do something wrong?\u201d Hisagi asked, as polite as possible without seeming like a pitiful slave. That was exactly what ticked Jinta off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re slowly starting to come around, but it\u2019s not fast enough for my tastes. I still don\u2019t like the way you talk or that look in your eye. Those cites aren\u2019t going anywhere, but you\u2019re just waiting for the chance to run back to your Soul Society buddies, aren\u2019t you? I think it\u2019s about time you turned into a sniveling slave, sixty nine man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta moved his hand to his shoulder and pinched Hisagi off it. The young god dropped the vice captain in his palm and held him up to his grinning face. Hisagi just continued to cower before the boyish face, backing away from it as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do to me? Torture me?\u201d Hisagi asked, almost choking because he was so frightened. Jinta liked that the man was frightened, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Hisagi should be bowing down to him, not backing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, torturing slaves is fun, but I have a faster method in mind. I\u2019m just gonna beat you into submission!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi was about to ask what that meant, but wasn\u2019t able to before Jinta\u2019s other hand appeared and flicked him into the horizon. Hisagi was spiraling uncontrollably toward the city they had just visited. Before he got anywhere near it, though, Jinta put his arm through another space-time hole and caught the flying bug. Taking his hand out, Jinta brought his open palm up to his face just like before. This time, instead of cowering, Hisagi was laying on his stomach in incredible pain. Jinta took the same finger he flicked Shuhei with and started to press it down on the speck-sized Soul Reaper. To Hisagi, it felt like a skyscraper\u2026no\u2026ten skyscrapers were crushing him with their weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanna see if I can squash you and then bring you back to life? I am a god, after all. Although, I can\u2019t do ANYTHING yet. If I could, I\u2019d of made myself bigger already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta didn\u2019t hear Hisagi respond, probably because he was in so much pain. Jinta removed his finger and tilted his hand. The weakened Hisagi suddenly felt his world turn upside down as he rolled off the god\u2019s palm and started to fall several miles down to the ground. Jinta never let him get that far, though, as he quickly brought his knee up and bashed Hisagi back up. The head of the Ninth Division felt as if gravity had reversed and he watched the boy\u2019s chest and face fly past him. When he finally fell back down, it wasn\u2019t Jinta hand that caught him. The boy god opened his mouth and allowed Hisagi to freefall right into it like a popcorn kernel. Jinta snapped his mouth closed and started violently smashing Hisagi into his cheeks with his giant, pink muscle. Hisagi felt himself becoming drenched in Jinta\u2019s salvia. If this continued, it would start to digest him. Before that happened, Jinta spat the once proud Soul Reaper into his palm and clapped his hands together. He rubbed his hands together as if cleaning them, smothering Hisagi in wet flesh. When he was done, he took his hand away to find sixty nine man plastered to his left hand. Jinta looked at him cruelly and brought him closer to his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready to surrender? Or are we going to continue?\u201d Jinta asked. The only thing that went thought Hisagi\u2019s mind was the thought of being killed by this boy\u2026no, this god. This god was really going to kill him at this rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I give\u2026\u201d Hisagi barely managed to blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that? You give? As in, \u2019I\u2019ll give you more trouble\u2019?\u201d Hisagi\u2019s eyes widened and he shook his head. Jinta, however, just ignored him. He was having too much fun to stop now. \u201cGuess you still need to be knocked around a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta once again flicked the sticky Soul Reaper off his hand and into the distance. He caught him the same way as before, but this time put another hand through a second hole which caused it to reappear several miles away from the one that held Hisagi. Jinta tossed the vice captain at his other hand, which caught him and threw him back. Jinta played catch with Hisagi for awhile before taking his hands from the rips in reality. He held Hisagi out in front of him and looked him over. He was in bad shape, with both his arms bent at odd angles and blood practically flowing from his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot anything to say before he continue, bug boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi didn\u2019t have the energy to even cry.  He was scared of dying and only wanted to live, so in his desperation he decided to abandon everything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be good. I\u2019ll be a good slave. Just please have mercy on me, Lord Jinta. I beg you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta smiled and replied, \u201cGood, then we\u2019re done.\u201d, before putting his other hand over Hisagi. Using his powers, he healed the slave of all his injuries and returned him to perfect health. When Hisagi felt his energy return, he immediately got off his back and onto his hands and knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s your god and master?\u201d Jinta asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are, Lord Jinta.\u201d Hisagi replied, kissing Jinta\u2019s skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho could squash you like the bug you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could, Lord Jinta.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat will you do if you\u2019re ever given the chance to run away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay with you for as long as my meaningless life allows, Lord Jinta!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta smirked a smirk that would put Aizen to shame. The old Hisagi was officially dead; all that remained was a shell of the Soul Reaper. A shell that would serve him without question. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta headed toward the next city, Hisagi now a pathetic whimpering bug on his shoulder, and was feeling pretty darn good about himself. Suddenly, he realized what a treasure he had in Hisagi. He faced the little guy and said, \"So, what's going on in the Soul Society right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi instantly got to his feet and said, \"Mayuri Kurotsuchi, head of the Research and Development Department at the Soul Society, is currently working on an antidote to undo the effects of your godly stature Lord Jinta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta frowned at that and said, \"Really...how far along was he the last time you were there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A day ago he said he would need a day or two to complete the antidote. Therefore, he could very well have it complete by now! But that was back when you were a lesser god than you are now. Surely nothing he has can stop you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta smiled at Hisagi and said, \"No doubt! What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain General Yamamoto also expressed the desire to fire the Kido Cannon in an attempt to stop you. Again, this was a plan when you were in a less form. I doubt it could hurt you now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta nodded slowly. So far so good. Nothing too threatening appeared to be on the horizon. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi racked his brain for any and all information relating to the Soul Society. \"That's...that's all I can think of Lord Jinta. If anything else is going on in the Soul Society it is outside my knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta nodded again and said, \"Good work slave. You did good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi nodded happily, glad that he could finally be of use to his god and master. Jinta pandered for a moment on his situation. He was god like and getting even stronger every second that passed. Currently, both the Soul Society and Hueco Mundo were interested in him and had sent agents to take care of him. Through his own great power and ingenuity he had managed to repel all these opposing forces. Someone in the Soul Society was trying to create an antidote so it wasn't impossible to think that someone in Hueco Mundo was doing the same. Luckily, neither of these antidotes appeared to be done and, with all likelihood, Jinta would soon become powerful enough that the antidotes wouldn't matter a whit. He cracked his knuckles and decided not to worry about it. Surely nothing would come even close to opposing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approached the city and got much the same reaction as before. The people screamed and panicked and attempted to escape which Jinta prevented by creating a wall around them. He smirked down at the puny specks and said, \"Alright listen up! You're city number three on God Jinta's conquest list! I want all you people to come to the center of the city immediately and start worshiping me! Any who don't will be punished indiscriminately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, around a quarter of the people hurried to the center of the city, by vehicle or foot, while the other three quarters still tried to escape. Jinta punished a quarter of those people by opening a rip in reality directly below them, sending them to a second hole that appeared above his waiting mouth. He swallowed them whole, adding them to the still digesting folk from the other town. He looked back down into the city and said, \"If you don't want the same, then get to the center of the city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining population gathered as he commanded. Once again Jinta had a small army of insects to do with whatever he pleased. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta was just about to put his new batch of slaves to work went he felt a variety of sounds gather behind him. He turned around just in time to see the army gathering before him again, this time with a much bigger force. Several groups of tanks and jeeps plowed through the forest toward the wall Jinta had made. Many helicopters flew over the wall and surrounded Jinta, who only looked at them in amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLong time no see, military bugs. Where have you been?\u201d Jinta asked. His only reply was an \u201copen fire\u201d from one of the soldiers and the entire force began firing upon him. The tanks fired their bombshells over the wall and they exploded upon impact with Jinta\u2019s torso. Because of Jinta\u2019s growth, the only thing the giant god felt was a slight pressure created from the attacks. It was as if feathers were being thrown at him. \u201cYou guys didn\u2019t stand a chance last time, so what makes you think you can harm me now? You\u2019ve got guts, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta allowed the army to waste their ammo for the next couple minutes. Every explosion upon his titanic form was just absorbed by his size. His shirt wasn\u2019t even getting burned. Growing tired, Jinta took a step forward and stomped on a group of tanks. Around ten of them were crushed instantly, while another ten were destroyed simply by the fissures that came afterwards. The townsfolk watched in horror as the brave soldiers that fought for their country were trampled on like bugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young giant noticed a few jets coming toward the battlefield in the distance. They were probably planning on passing him and attacking him from behind, but they were foolish. Before they got the chance, Jinta sidestepped and watched the jets crash into his chest and explode on impact. The kid brushed the debris off his top and took another step forward. As his bare foot hovered over another group of tanks, they attempted to fire up at the sole to repel it. The attack just tickled Jinta and made him snicker before he made pancakes out of the armored vehicles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jinta was dealing with the jets and the second group of tanks, a good number of soldiers started to climb the giant\u2019s foot. Jinta noticed them reach the top and start shooting and stabbing the skin. They would have had better luck breaking through steel. Jinta smirked down at the brave bugs before using the bottom of his other foot to wipe their tiny bodies off. He looked back up to see several helicopters flying at him and shooting his face with machine guns. As they did this, a number of soldiers jumped out of the helicopters and hooked onto the front of Jinta\u2019s shirt. They were probably planning on climbing the boy without him knowing, but unfortunately they didn\u2019t know of his super senses. After Jinta blew the helicopters away, he looked down at his shirt as smiled at the frightened men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to accomplish? \u201c Jinta asked them before taking his thumb and squashing each of the climbing bugs one by one. Each one left behind a small red dot which Jinta cleaned up by first licking the blood off his thumb and then wiping his shirt with it. As he was busy doing this, some more helicopters circled around him and dropped off some more forces on his back. Jinta growled in annoyance and tried to reach behind him to grab the insects, but they were in such a place that Jinta couldn\u2019t reach them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn ticks, get off!\u201d Jinta yelled at them. To his surprise, he started to hear small explosions coming from his back and the screams of the soldiers as they fell to their deaths. The god looked at his shoulder where Hisagi was firing Shakkaho at the climbing forces. When they were all taken care of, Hisagi noticed Jinta\u2019s stare and immediately bowed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, master! I just wanted to help. If I acted out of line, please punish me!\u201d Hisagi said with his face buried in Jinta\u2019s clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s fine. You did good. Keep up the food work.\u201d Jinta replied before turning his attention to the large amount of helicopters around him. At this rate they\u2019d continue to drop soldiers on him until it became an annoyance. Jinta decided to take care of all of them at once. He stretched his arms out and used his powers to gather all the flying contraptions together; squashing them into a ball. Most of the pilots were already crushed, but some were still alive and struggling to get out of their twisted vehicles. Jinta let the ball plummet downward until he kicked it back up with his foot. He juggled the ball of metal for a bit before giving a swift kick and sending it hundreds of miles away. Not even he knew where it would land. Jinta looked back at the remaining forces and saw that they were starting to retreat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRun, little specks! Tell your superiors how much you got owned by God Jinta!\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the armed forces scurried away Jinta thought it was because they were retreating, escaping from the giant god. In reality, they were merely moving to a different location. The ones in charge of deploying the armed forces had never really believed that their men alone could take care of this threat no matter how many tanks or helicopters, jets or bombs they had. So they had prepared a contingency plan. Once they were far enough away from the massive boy, who was turning his attention on the trapped inhabitants of the city once more, they began prepping their secret weapon: a nuclear warhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had wanted to avoid using this at all costs. The power unleashed would devastate the entire surrounding area, killing most of the trapped people in the city and irradiating the few who survived the blast. But it was a necessary evil. If they didn't do this, then the boy would only cause more horrific destruction around the country and, possibly, across the entire world. The countdown began, the boy's coordinates locked into the computer. Within ten seconds, this so called god would be no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta had no idea about what was going to happen in less than thirty seconds. He was too busy picking around the crowded thousands of his new group of slaves. He wanted to do something special with them. He had already had his feet licked and his body massaged so what else could he do to these little specks? There were so many possibilities. Then again, he could always ask one of his two favorite slaves what to do. Better yet, maybe they could collaborate on something. Jinta decided to save that idea for another time. He raised his hand and was about to call all his new slaves into his palm when a strange whistling sound filled the air. Jinta straightened up and looked into the distance. With his super senses he could easily spot the nuke headed his way. He grinned and laughed at this futile attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even a nuclear blast is enough to stop me you idiots!\" He yelled, not caring if the army could hear him or not. He puffed out his chest and said, \"Go ahead! Take your best shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Hisagi and Ichigo began shouting at once at Jinta who grabbed them both out of annoyance and brought them to  his face. \"What?!? What's wrong with you two? You're annoying me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo spoke first. \"Please Lord Jinta! You can't let that bomb detonate on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta narrowed his eyes at Ichigo and said in a dangerous voice, \"And why is that carrot top? Are you actually trying to order me around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo fell to his knees again, shaking with fear, and said, \"That wasn't my intention Lord Jinta! Please forgive me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi took up where Ichigo left off and said, \"What he means, Lord Jinta, is that if the bomb goes off on your body the blast won't harm you in the slightest, but the blast or the resulting radiation could severely hurt me and Ichigo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi then fell to his knees as well and both shouted, \"PLEASE SPARE US LORD JINTA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta nodded slowly, realizing that they were right. He didn't want to waste his most loyal slaves. They were his to do with what he wanted for as long as he wanted, which just so happened to be forever. But he still needed to get rid of that bomb. He could just open reality and have it disappear from this world altogether...but that wouldn't be too much fun. As he watched the bomb approach he suddenly got a great idea! He positioned his body so that the bomb was heading towards his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the army base, the soldiers watched via computer as the bomb swiftly approached its target. The boy wasn't even trying to move, even though they could tell that he knew it was coming. They prayed that this would be the end of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta opened his mouth wide as the bomb fell toward him, catching it neatly on his tongue and swallowing it whole. The world seemed to hold still as a tiny lump traveled down Jinta's throat. He sighed and patted his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the snack army bugs! That wasn't half--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was suddenly interrupted as a groaning sound emanated from his belly. He clutched it in discomfort and stared down at it. The bomb had apparently went off inside him. He groaned as his stomach churned and bubbled, the bomb's full fury being unleashed inside his body. Jinta felt his hands move watched in shock as his stomach slowly swelled, the sounds from within becoming louder and more intense. When his stomach was pressed tight against his shirt, the shirt itself starting to ride up he opened his mouth and belched loud and long, directly downward. The nuclear force inside his body changed and was released as a concentrated blast of pure energy which fell onto the city below him. Jinta's stomach slowly deflated back to it's original taught form and the nuclear blast fizzled out. Jinta sighed and patted his stomach again, happy that it settled down. He looked down at the city and was met with nothing but a smoking crater, no trace of his slaves or their pathetic dwellings left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! Look what you made me do! You army specks better not come near me again or I'll make you SUFFER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta was more than annoyed at having his fun cut short at this city. He stepped on the ashy smudge until it was gone, the very sight of it making him angrier and angrier. He turned his attention to the next city and started off, determined to use them to their fullest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta was unbelievably pissed. Those army bugs had made him kill off and entire population of potential slaves. Now, he was heading for the next city to taker out his rage on them. There was a high probability that this city was going to be decimated too, because once you make Lord Jinta mad\u2026lots of people are gonna die. As the young god marched toward the distant city, each step covering one mile after another, the inside of his body was changing in mysterious ways. The remaining radiation leftover in his gut made its way throughout his body where is bonded with the slime-infected cells. Two forces, one magical while the other scientific, mixed together and began to change their host. Jinta felt the familiar sensation of his body filling with raw energy. His angry scowl changed to a bright grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, I know this feeling! I\u2019m about to gro--\u201d Jinta said with anticipation, but was interrupted when a horrible pain shot through his stomach. The boy hugged his stomach and fell to his knees, his weight creating a large earthquake that shook the area. Ichigo and Hisagi (who had both been placed in Jinta\u2019s pocket before he swallowed the warhead) heard their master groaning in pain. They immediately climbed up the inside of the pocket until they reached the opening and looked up at their master\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord Jinta, what\u2019s wrong?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you in pain? What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta cracked an eye opened and looked toward his slaves. Through his pain, he managed to say, \u201cI think that nuke I ate is giving me indigestion. Urrrh!!\u201d The pain just got worse as Jinta\u2019s body began to give off a green glow. While he <b>was</b> growing, the different factors involved with this growth spurt meant the process took a greater toll on Jinta\u2019s body. The results were defiantly going to be massive, though, that\u2019s for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe power within Jinta built up inside his gut\u2026and then exploded. Jinta\u2019s body expanded outward in a quick burst. It happened a second time, soon followed by a third burst. The sheer amount of spiritual pressure Jinta was giving off as he grew crated a crater around him. When the glow and pain faded, Jinta felt refreshed. The pain just vanished and the first thing he saw through his blurry eyes was that he was standing in the crater created by his spiritual pressure. He wasn\u2019t focused on that, however, but his own body. Just by looking at his hands he could tell his size had increased. Jinta clenched his fists and stepped out of the crater to compare his new size with the rest of the world. The change was obvious; the town he was once looking at in the distance was now <b>below</b> him. It was still several miles away, but Jinta just had to take step forward. Meanwhile, Ichigo and Hisagi had been forced to the bottom of the pocket. Jinta\u2019s pants had become so thick that they could no longer hold onto the edge of the pocket. Because of this, they couldn\u2019t know just how big their god had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess those army bugs are to thank for this. I guess nukes are like energy pills for gods! I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not green, though.\u201d Jinta joked, turning his attention from his new size to the miniature city before him. The population had long since become aware of Jinta\u2019s presence and were trying to flee. Jinta stepped forward and placed both his feet on either side of the city so it rested between them. Jinta smirked when noticed each of his feet were the same size as the city. He had more than doubled in size and could crush the city with a single stomp! Jinta spread his arms as he spoke to the city below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttention, specks! You\u2019re all now property of GOD!\u201d Jinta announced, putting his hands on his hips when he was done. \u201cActually, you bugs are so small that you barely count as specks! You\u2019re almost germs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of this city weren\u2019t paying him as much attention as the others, probably because their was no wall restricting them. Wall or not, these specks must have been brain damaged if they thought they had any chance of getting away. Jinta crouched down and positioned a hand over the city, casting it in darkness. Using his gravity powers, Jinta made every individual in the city float up toward his palm. It didn\u2019t matter if they were being loyal and waiting for their fate, or being disobediently and trying to run; they were all his. Everyone was lifted off the streets, out of their homes, and even out of their vehicles. Jinta raised the population up to his face and smiled at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all may be small, but I can see the scared expressions on your faces quite clearly! Don\u2019t be scared; you\u2019ll like serving your god\u2026until I get bored of you, that is.\u201d Jinta laughed, blowing hot air at his immobilized slaves. Glancing at his pocket, Jinta pointed a finger at it and suddenly Ichigo and Hisagi found themselves flying in front of Jinta\u2019s face with the other slaves. \u201cGlad you could join the party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teens were in awe. Jinta had been a god of great size before\u2026but he just kept getting bigger! His boyish, smirking face took up their entire field of vision. Most of the slaves around him were scared and crying, but the two of them simply smiled in joy. Jinta was their reason for living and seeing him this big brought them nothing but happiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bugs ready to work? I got two jobs for you and I think you all may just barely be enough to cover them.\u201d Jinta used one of his fingers to split half the slaves into two groups and direct them toward his ears. To someone Jinta\u2019s size, it would appear as if a bunch of tiny particles were flowing into his ears. \u201cFirst of all, I want you specks to clean out my ears. A simple task; just toss all the gunk out!\u201d Jinta gave the remaining slaves a smile and lifted his shirt up, exposing his bellybutton. The other half of the population flowed into his navel. \u201cYou guys can clean all the lint out of my navel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slaves had been shown their master\u2019s power and didn\u2019t dare question it. Those in his ears began lifting big chunks of ear wax and tossing it outside. Those in his bellybutton rolled up large globs of lint and sweat and pushing them out the \u201ccave\u201d. Ichigo had been assigned to the right ear while Hisagi was in the navel. It was the Soul Reaper\u2019s second time in the navel, and it was even bigger than before. It was equal in size to a city district. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his slaves served him, Jinta sat down and spread his legs so the city was nestled between them. The tickling sensations coming from his ears and navel felt good. The giant kid leaned forward and began using his fingers to play with the city. Skyscrapers were toppled over, buildings turned to dust, craters made just by pressing his digits into the concrete. There was no one left in the city, but that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t cause some destruction. While he did this, Ichigo began to ask him something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lord, forgive me for asking, but what do you plan on doing next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know, carrot top. Maybe I\u2019ll take a walk to Tokyo and turn the capital into a smoking ruin! Even better, maybe I\u2019ll cross the sea and visit another country. I always wanted to use the Eiffel Tower as a tooth pick!\u201d Jinta laughed as he thought of all the possibilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should show that false god, Grimmjow, who the boss is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be fun,\u201d Jinta replied as he mentally measured himself to the Arrancar\u2019s last known size. With his new growth spurt, that false god would be about half his size. \u201cbut I think I\u2019ll wait until I get even bigger! I\u2019ll teach that pussy cat a lesson once I can hold him in the palm of my hand.\u201d Jinta was thinking BIG. If he continued to grow, he may eventually outgrow the planet. It was best to have his fun with Mother Earth first before he became bored with the planet. If he got bored early, there was always Soul Society\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, elsewhere\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> As Jinta enjoyed the sensations of his slaves working in his body, the sensations of total dominance, he was totally unaware of the force that was growing in the void between worlds. Grimmjow had been livid ever since his defeat at Jinta's hands. He had prowled around inside the void using any power that came to his mind to escape. Cero's were blasted, punches and kicks were thrown, he had even attempted to tear apart the fabric of space with his own hands. Unfortunately for him, even though he had powers that Jinta didn't, namely his ability to regenerate his body from damage, he didn't have the ability to rip open holes in space. He had worn himself out after a few hours of this exercise in futility. He was well and truly trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! If I ever get my hands on that kid I'm going to tear his heart out of his chest and let him watch it beat!\" He muttered murderously to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow sat down in the void and just stared into space. At this time there was nothing he could do. For hours he just stared into the void, occasionally he'd wander about, wondering if his position in the void related in any way to his position in the real world. While Jinta was outside dominating the world he was trapped like an animal in a cage. It made him so angry! But there was little he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so he thought. Almost immediately after Jinta's own transformation he himself started undergoing one. He felt it first as a tingling deep within him. The tingle deepened to a full fledged itching throughout his whole being. The slime was reacting in Grimmjow in a different manner than Jinta. Instead of his body increasing in size his muscles were bulking up, his chest expanding, his abs popping out in definition. His arms strained the sleeves of his coat while his legs filled his pants to the breaking point. His Hierro increased in hardness to the point that he was nigh impenetrable. He could feel new strength flowing through him. Unfortunately, it was strength that was useless to him, trapped in a void. The slime continued to change him, strengthening his powers more and more. His healing factor was improved as well though it would awhile before he could test it. His healing powers combined with his new and improved Hierro made him nearly invincible, much like a god. Jinta was a force to be reckoned with when compared with the humans, but to a being of equal size he was still just a pathetic kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow felt his body start growing taller as well, his height inching (to him) slowly upward. His spiritual pressure was crushingly powerful. Even Jinta would quail under this ferocity. Grimmjow directed this fierce pressure against the void and saw it waver slightly. It appeared to be warping outward, unable to withstand the force of Grimmjow's presence. He forced the space further and further until sweat was beading on his forehead, his powers stretching to their maximum. Unfortunately, for him, he had to relent before he could tear through, the space bouncing back to its former shape. It was no use. He had begun much, much, more powerful but it still wasn't enough to break free. But soon enough he would have the strength necessary to escape from his prison and show Jinta who the real god was. </span></div></div>",

Everyone was in a panic trying to keep up with the incoming data as they ran back and forth. The entire 12th Division had gone to hell. The flowerily-robed captain made his way to the head of the 12th Division, who was standing in front of his organ-shaped control panel while reading through pages upon pages of data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here to check on your progress. How\u2019s the antidote coming?\u201d the serious faced captain asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat? I finished that hours ago. The blood sample retrieved by Vice-Captain Hisagi was immensely helpful.\u201d replied the skeleton-like man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?! You were told to report to the Captain-Commander the moment it was complete! What were you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been too busy going through the new data. Did you know the subject has grown again? He might just be able to devastate the planet if he knew how to control his spiritual energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying that thing grew again? I wasn\u2019t informed of this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHead-Captain was, however.\u201d came another voice belonging to Ukitake. \u201cHe has given the order to move the Kido Cannon to the World of the Living and have it ready to fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell him to revoke the order immediately! There is no need for such drastic actions yet, I\u2019ll have the antidote ready for departure in a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure it will work? If it doesn\u2018t, you understand what we will be forced to do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I sure it will work? You dare question my intellect? It is not a question of whether it\u2019ll work, but if we can distribute enough of it to have any effect on the boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how do you plan on giving him such a large amount? A pill won\u2019t work, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked. It\u2019s actually quite simple. All we will have to do is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on Earth, Jinta had finished toying with the minuscule city. Everything had been reduced to smoking ruins and large craters. If someone didn\u2019t know of Jinta, their mind wouldn\u2019t be able to comprehend what could do this. The boy god was bored now, however. With a wave of his hand, the thousands of his slaves flew out of his ears and navel and gathered within the ruined city before him. Ichigo and Hisagi had been separated from the group, however, and rested on their god\u2019s city-sized shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA passable job, bugs. Next I want you to\u2026\u201d Jinta trailed off when he noticed something approaching. The spiritual pressure he sensed meant they were Soul Reapers. What did they want now? Looking down, he spotted several groups of Soul Reapers pushing large cannon-like devices into position. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna attack me with cannons now? Ha, this should be good\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cannons were smaller, weaker versions of the almightily Kido Cannon. While formerly used to fire kido, these cannons were specify designed by Mayuri to hold a different kind of ammo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay men, if this doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019re dead.\u201d explained a high-ranking officer. \u201cAim and fire at will!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta watched as the Soul Reapers began shooting small, round objects at him from the cannons. They were even smaller than the bombshells used by the military bugs. Jinta blocked a few with his hand, just in case. Once he noticed he couldn\u2019t even feel the impacts, he allowed the rest to hit his face. He was letting the Bug Reapers have their fun before he punished them. Strangely, the explosions caused by the round ammo didn\u2019t spread smoke\u2026but an unusual purple gas. The gas seeped into the god\u2019s skin and turned it purple for a few seconds before reverting back to its normal color tone. Some of the stuff got into his nose and started to irritate it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you bugs throwing at me? This stuff itches.\u201d Jinta pondered as he scratched the places the smoke infected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord Jinta, this may be the antidote I spoke of!\u201d Hisagi warned his master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAntidote? Are they trying to cure a god or give me a rash?\u201d Jinta laughed at the Soul Reaper\u2019s futile attempts. The bugs on the ground continued to fire, hoping for some kind of result. Mayuri\u2019s antidote was definitely having an effect on Jinta as it spread through his cells from several different entry points. The question was: what kind of effect? Captain Kurotsuchi\u2019s calculations were flawless, but the genius couldn\u2019t have known that the radiation from the human\u2019s weapon had fused with the slime inside Jinta. The result would therefore be not quite what everyone was expecting\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The antidote spread swiftly through Jinta's system fusing with the radiation and the slime, combining together into an entirely new substance. The antidote was broken down into its components, the parts that actively worked to reverse the slimes effects were broken down and destroyed while the other chemicals were recycled into his body, changing his body in an entirely unexpected way. Jinta's cells vibrated and split rapidly, a wave of new cell division coursing through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the Soul Reapers were watching with bated breath, hoping, praying even, that something would happen to end this nightmare. Suddenly, Jinta started feeling a strange sensation overcome his body similar to the feeling he experienced whenever he grew. He grinned down at the Soul Reapers and said, \"Whatever you germs fired at me is making me stronger! I can feel it! Hahahahaha! Thanks a lot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Jinta's body was slowly growing again, his monstrous stature expanding to new heights. But this growth was different. He wasn't getting proportionally larger. His arms and legs were growing longer, his hands and feet were growing broader, and his torso was slowly stretching. His shirt rode up, revealing his stomach which was starting to have abs pop up on it. His shorts were slowly riding up, hugging his thighs. Jinta looked over his body curiously, wondering what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what gives? What's happening to me?\" Jinta suddenly stopped talking and grabbed his throat. Was that his voice? Why did it sound so strange?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta may not have been able to see what was happening but Ichigo and Hisagi could. Their lord, master, and god was aging, his face maturing, his body growing to that of a teenager, comparable to Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Soul Reapers soon fell into a panic. There plan had failed. They were as good as dead if they stayed here! The officers in command tried to regain order but it was impossible. They simply opened the door to the Soul Society and fled, not wanting to stay and face an annoyed teenage god. Back in the Soul Society, Kurotsuchi, Kyoraku, and Ukitake were all watching in horror as Jinta changed again, to the young god's own advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're supposed to be changing him back, not making him stronger Mayuri!\" Kyoraku shouted at the mad scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inconceivable! My calculations were flawless! Absolute perfection! He should be shrinking back down into an ordinary human!\" Kurotsuchi shouted, tossing papers aside as he looked through his data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps there was an unknown factor involved.\" Ukitake suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible! It would have shown up in his blood!\" Kurotsuchi scoffed at Ukitake's ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took so long, maybe his body developed an immunity or something!\" Kyoraku said with agitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That blood sample was too old! By the time I got it the boy had already grown again! This isn't my miscalculation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Captains argued amongst themselves, the leftover chemicals from the antidote had all been used up, disappearing from Jinta's body and returning his aging process back to normal. Jinta looked over his body in wonder, running his fingers over his newly developed muscles. He called up a hole in space that connected with the ocean so he could see his reflection. No longer was a boy's face looking back at him, but the face of a teenager. He looked over his handsome face appreciatively before closing the holes. He brought his two loyal slaves in front of his face and said in his deeper voice, \"Well? What do you think of your god now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo immediately answered. \"You look amazing Lord Jinta! You're becoming a greater god every second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi added, \"Your form is fantastic! Truly you are a sight to behold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta grinned happily and said, \"Yeah, I'm awesome! Though these clothes are feeling really uncomfortable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta rolled his shoulders, the fabric tearing slightly as he did so. His shirt was now far too small for him, barely covering his chest. His shorts were no better, hugging his crotch and butt and leaving nothing to the imagination. These were clothes for a child, not for a teenage god. Not that there was anything he could do about it...yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta looked around him and smirked as he imagined what he must look like to the insignificant nothings below him. His body may have aged but he still had the mindset of a child. It was a dangerous combination. He felt stronger as well, like his spiritual pressure had increased along with his age. He knew that all of his powers were stronger, that he could use them with more ease now. The only question was, what to test it on?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Jinta had taken enough time in admiring his new body, his sights were set on testing how much his powers had advanced. The question was\u2026what would make a good guinea pig? Jinta placed his hands on his (now exposed) hips and studied the land around him. He could spot several mountains and a few more cities that were just steps away. All of them were possible targets, but Jinta wanted something else. His eyes drifted upward and then it hit him. The red-haired teen grinned and glanced over at his two servants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two bugs better hold on.\u201d Jinta warned as he laced his hand over them and formed a small bubble of bent reality around them. Neither of them knew what it was for until Jinta opened a large tear in front of him and stepped through it. When they arrived on the other side, Ichigo and Hisagi looked around and couldn\u2019t believe their eyes. They were in space! The big blue planet itself was visible in the distance. The bubble around the two of them was to protect them from the vacuum of space, which their god was apparently unaffected by. As for their exact position in space, it was right next to the Moon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, this\u2019ll do nicely.\u201d Jinta muttered to himself as his gaze looked over the Moon. Despite having become the biggest thing on Earth, the Moon was still much larger than him. He was about to change that, though. Jinta stretched his arms out and pointed his palms in the direction of the giant sphere. The teenaged god began to channel his space-warping abilities into the Moon, wishing to change its form. Ichigo and Hisagi watched in awe as the Moon started to ripple; its very existence being toyed with. The Moon quickly began to shrink, becoming less and less of a bigger object to Jinta every second. Countless laws of physics were being broken by this act. Jinta didn\u2019t care, though, as physics were but school rules that could easily be broken. Eventually, it became the size of Jinta\u2019s torso\u2026then his head\u2026and finally Jinta was cupping it between his gargantuan hands. It continued to shrink still until it was like a golf ball to the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so big and beautiful now, are you?\u201d Jinta said as he held the Moon between his fingers. The teen flicked his wrist and tossed the gumball-sized satellite into his mouth. He started to chew, reducing the celestial body into a mush which he swallowed. Jinta smacked his lips and said, \u201cHmm, I guess it isn\u2019t made of cheese.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Soul Reapers couldn\u2019t believe their eyes. Jinta had just shrunken and eaten the moon! Impossible was not a word Jinta knew. This did bring about some worry in Ichigo, however, as he said, \u201cMy lord, won\u2019t this have disastrous effects on the Earth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what? Why should I care?\u201d Jinta replied, scoffing at carrot top\u2019s meaningless worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, don\u2019t you want to be the one that brings chaos and destruction to the planet? It wouldn\u2019t seem right if physics became the reason for Earth\u2019s ruin when someone as powerful as you exists!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026you\u2019re right. I guess I\u2019ll just have to fill up this empty space, eh?\u201d Jinta said as he cracked his knuckles and outstretched his hands toward the spot where the Moon once rested. This time, he spread his powers outward and started to pull as much space debris as he could find toward the spot in front of him. Space was full of junk and Jinta was going to put it all to good use. Debris from as far as Jinta could reach began to flow together and join as one. A sphere started to form before Jinta, slowly becoming bigger and bigger until it dwarfed even him. The sphere didn\u2019t remain just a sphere, however, and began to take on another appearance. When Jinta eventually finished, his arms fell to his sides and he started to breath heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026that wasn\u2019t as easy as I thought it would be.\u201d Jinta said to himself. Surely, shrinking something bigger than yourself and then creating something of equal size defiantly consumed a lot of spiritual energy. \u201cAh well, I think it was worth it.\u201d Jinta smiled a she looked over his work. The Moon had been replaced by a giant replica of Jinta\u2019s face. Now, whenever someone looked up into the night sky, they would see the Moon gone and replaced with the smiling face of their god, as if to say that he was always watching. Jinta\u2019s two slaves praised his for his work and he thanked them with just a wave of his hand. He opened another rip to Earth, but was too weak to make it lead directly to the surface. Instead, it led to the Earth\u2019s orbit, right above Japan. Jinta put his hands behind his head and floated in a resting position. He looked down at the planet and concentrated so he could hear what was happening on the surface. All of Earth now new of his presence and was in a state of panic. Cities were rioting, loyal followers were trying to speak to others and form religions around him, and world leaders tried to calm their people as they themselves took shelter in \u201chidden\u201d locations. Jinta continued to listen to the sounds of the planet as he gathered his strength back. His slaves also laid down, wrapping themselves in Jinta\u2019s white shirt. Pleasing a giant god was a tough job. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Soul Society was in an uproar. Every single one of their attempts to stop the rampaging boy (now teen) had failed spectacularly, resulting in casualties upon casualties. Captain General Yamamoto had had enough. After the spectacular failure of Captain Kurotsuchi's antidote he knew that there was only one course of action left for them to try before all out war had to be declared. He had called all the captains together to discuss the situation. Once everyone had gathered Yamamoto spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have called this meeting of the captains in order to tell you all what we're going to do to deal with the menace that that giant boy presents. I have waited for too long, allowing the other captains to try and contain this situation, but no more. There is only one course of action remaining to us. At this very moment the boy is resting in space. Now is the perfect time to fire the Kido Cannon! I want it prepped and ready for firing in less than ten minutes! There will be no excuses, no more stalling, and no other plans! If even this fails we will have little other choice than declaring all out war against the monster! Make sure your squads are prepared if it comes to that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamamoto did not give the other captains any time to consider or question his plan. He was done waiting around on the promises of those who couldn't deliver. He gave the order to fire the Kido Cannon and the Soul Reapers in charge of it began to prep it. First, they moved it out into the World of the Living directly beneath the slumbering form of Jinta, barely visible against the new moon. Next, they quickly found the coordinates for Jinta's position and aimed the cannon so that the blast would hit him directly. Finally, the removed all the seals and inhibitors on the artillery, not holding back a single ounce of its power. With all the preparations complete the entire Soul Society watched with bated breath, hoping against hope that this would finally work and the nightmare would be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a crushing release of spiritual pressure the Kido Cannon charged to maximum power and fired the blast into the sky. The force of the blast could be seen for miles and miles around, the light almost blindingly bright. It blasted the clouds around it outward, creating a ring around the spirit particles. The blast gathered nearby spirit particles as well, gaining even more strength as it traveled. Jinta, still asleep, had no idea what was coming for him. Hisagi and Ichigo, sleeping as deeply as their god and master, also had no idea what was coming. The trio was peacefully dreaming of the times to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta was dreaming of being even bigger, truly ruling over the planet. Nothing could stand in his way. He was holding all his slaves in one hand and in the other was those who had attempted to oppose him. Grimmjow, the Soul Reapers, even the Arrancars. With a smirk he crushed them all in his hand, grinding the remains into oblivion. With them out of the way he could now set his sights on the rest of the universe. His body would gain more and more power, expanding further and further, taking over all that was seen and unseen until every universe was under his total command. If anything displeased him he could, with a thought, just twist it into something else. Everything was subject to his whims. Creation and destruction were nothing for him. Nothing was impossible for him anymore. Jinta grinned in his sleep and mumbled something to himself before descending back into true sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo and Hisagi, meanwhile, were having a similar dream. They both were standing before the massive feet of their god, his grinning face looking warmly down at them. They were at the head of a crowd of worshipers, stretching back so far into the distance they couldn't see the end of the crowd. As they watched their god he began to grow larger before their eyes. He levitated them up to his body and they found themselves standing on his expansive chest, his size so great he was creating a gravity field around him. Everywhere they looked they saw nothing but Jinta's body stretching away in every direction. They were truly insignificant to Jinta now and they couldn't be happier. There job was now infinitely more difficult but there could be no greater joy than cleaning and serving the master of the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for them the dreams were shattered as the blast from the Kido Cannon hit Jinta square in the back. The teen's eyes flew open and he yelled out in surprise waking Ichigo and Hisagi as well. The two slaves jumped up and looked around, disorientated and scared for their master who seemed to be in pain. Jinta grit his teeth and took the punishment, unable to avoid it or alleviate it in anyway. All he could do is wait.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta bit his lip as he resisted the urge to shout out in pain. Nothing was supposed to hurt him like this anymore! He was a god! Somehow, he knew this was the Soul Reapers\u2019 doing. They just didn\u2019t know when to quit. If this continued, however, it might actually do the trick. The pressure against his back was unbelievably intense. A minute more and it\u2019d tear right though him! If Jinta didn\u2019t want that to happen, he\u2019d have to act fast! With some quick thinking, Jinta used ever ounce of his godly strength to push himself to the side and allow the beam to fly past him. Jinta had a look of victory on his face as he watched the kido beam disappear into the depths of space. Ichigo and Hisagi also watched while knowing nothing could defeat their lord and master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, those smiles of satisfaction disappeared when their almighty master coughed up a large amount of blood. The carmine liquid floated in front of the boy-turned-teen\u2019s face as he stared at it with a puzzled look. Jinta\u2019s eyes slowly crept down to see, much to his horror, that he hadn\u2019t dodged the beam as much as he hoped. The kido cannon had taken a huge chunk of his hip with it; leaving nothing but a burning hole in his perfect body. In addition, his back was scotched black and any cotton fabrics that once covered it had been disintegrated. Jinta coughed dup some more blood as he started to feel light headed. Ichigo and Hisagi shouted up to their god while ignoring the wavering barrier wound them. If that fell, they\u2019d die instantly from the exposure to space, but the slaves were far more concerned with their god. Jinta heard their yells as they slowly got softer and softer until he heard and saw nothing else. His last though before darkness was that the pesky Soul Reapers were going to pay dearly for this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*The next day*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the world gave a sigh of relief, their mighty god rested on a bed somewhere else entirely. Jinta awoke to the sound of water and shot up instantly. He looked around in utter confusion. He was inside a room\u2026a very fancy bedroom with a sliding glass door that led outside. How was this possible? Why was he laying inside of a room instead of crushing it under his toe! The teen also took notice to his bandaged body. Using his hand, he touched the place where the kido cannon had hit him and was surprised to feel flesh. Jinta tore off the bandages and inspected his torso. Not even a scar was present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive. Even with my abilities; that wound would still have taken another three days to heal completely.\u201d spoke a voice outside the door. Jinta turned to the entrance to see a figure step into the room. He wore a long robe that appeared of royalty; complete with golden linings.  His hair was as blue as his own was red and his eyes shone silver. His face\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d yelped Jinta as he almost fell off the bed. The figure, save for the classy wardrobe and hair/eye color, looked EXACTLY LIKE HIM. \u201cW-who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI go by many names.\u201d the figure replied, walking over to Jinta\u2019s bed and started squatting down as if taking a seat. Jinta thought his look-alike was going to fall on his butt until a chair materialized underneath him. \u201cAtum, Izanagi, \u2018God\u2019. Those of Soul Society refer to me as the Spirit King.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the Spirit King?! Why does the Spirit King look like me? And where am I? Where\u2019s carrot top and sixty-nine man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will answer your questions one at a time.\u201d the Spirit King said, not appearing annoyed by Jinta\u2019s questions. \u201cI am a being older than time itself. Therefore, my original form as long since been lost. My appearance now depends on the current state of the universe. Since you are the most powerful being in existence next to me, my form has changed in response. As for where you are: this is my realm. Here, size has no meaning. A god like me would appear gargantuan in the universe and it would make interacting with my Royal Guard very difficult. Finally, your friends\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than those words were spoken, the door opened and in walked the two teenaged Soul Reapers. They no longer appeared as specks to Jinta, which made him feel kind of odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord Jinta, you\u2019re awake!\u201d cried Ichigo as he kneeled by the bed and smiled up at Jinta. The vice-captain soon joined him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re still acting like that. I\u2019m just as tall as you right now\u2026\u201d Jinta explained, scratching the back of his head at the oddity of that statement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat may be, but we can tell just by looking at you that you\u2019re a much greater being then us. We look at you and we see a god\u2026no matter what size you are!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Jinta muttered. They had a point; he could somehow feel that the two teens were far inferior to him. It was like the realm was simply playing tricks with their minds and he was still towering over the two Soul Reapers. He turned to the other god in the room and asked, \u201cSo, \u2018mighty Spirit King\u2019, why save me? Aren\u2019t I a threat to your domination of the galaxy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo reasons.\u201d the blue-haired Jinta replied. \u201cFor starters, your destruction would make the near future very troublesome. If you were to die, the spiritual energy that has built up in your body will be released for anyone to use. I believe a Soul Reaper known as S\u014dsuke Aizen is trying to create a key into my realm. Your spiritual energy would provide more than enough energy necessary for this. The second reason I saved you is because I have decided you will be my predecessor. You will be the next Spirit King.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, wait, wait!\u201d Jinta interrupted. \u201cMe? You sure about that? Did you miss the parts where I uprooted cities, trampled buildings, and snacked on innocent bystanders?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you do with your power does not concern me and I will not stop you. The only thing I care about is you possess that power. Even gods cannot live forever and I am dying, so a new Spirit King must be chosen soon. Aizen knows this and it is the reason he has set his plans in motion now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m game. I\u2019ll be glad to take your throne!\u201d Jinta grinned, liking the idea. He already planned on becoming God; this was just a faster method. The teen hoped off the bed and placed his hands on his hips. \u201cFirst things first, though. Point me in the direction of Soul Society. I need to teach those Soul Reapers a good lesson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that is your will, I will grant it. However, you must be made aware of some\u2026obstacles that threaten your accession. Three, to be precise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta sighed and sat back on the bed. This \u2018god\u2019 sure liked to talk. He just wanted to get back to destroying stuff and dominating everything under his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first lies in Soul Society. Two Soul Reapers, T\u014dshir\u014d Hitsugaya and Renji Abarai, have been given a mode complete version of the formula that turned you into what you are now. If this mixture is allowed to run its course through their systems, they will become gods even mightier than you. I will have no choice but to choose one of them as my predecessor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you have your names wrong. I squashed those two under my feet awhile back.\u201d Jinta said, showing his silver-eyed twin the bottom of his foot. The king merely shook his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you defeated were just lifeless gigais. Kisuke Urahara saved them at the last second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta clenched his fist in anger. He knew it was only a matter of time before that dirty insect started interfering with him. He was going to deal with him along with those two gods-to-be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe second danger is an Arrancar known as Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe pussy cat? He\u2019s no threat. I trapped that false god away. He\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat may be so, but every minute we talk, he gets stronger and stronger. You must deal with him eventually or else he may become too powerful for the void to contain. Whenever you choose to deal with him, know that you will be up against a worthy foe. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. Just tell me the last \u2018threat\u2019 so I can get to destroying the Soul Reapers.\u201d Jinta said, becoming impatient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHueco Mundo. Something is happening there. I don\u2019t know exactly what it is, for I cannot see into the depths of the Hollow World, but I can assure you it is a threat to your godhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, all I have to do is smash a few false gods and deal with whatever\u2019s in Hueco Mundo. Got it, now get me out of here!\u201d Jinta raised his voice, causing his two slaves to flinch a bit. The blue head didn\u2019t appear intimidated at all. He merely raised a hand and a tear in space and time, similar to Jinta\u2019s, appeared behind him. Jinta started to approach it when Ichigo spoke suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on a sec!\u201d Ichigo said, looking at the Spirit King with a glare. Jinta thought it was funny how the king looked just like him, and yet Ichigo didn\u2019t show the mirror image any respect. \u201cSoul Society is made up of spirit particles, right? Will Lord Jinta be able to just walk in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d the king replied. \u201cHe is a god. The laws I created are but tiny walls that he can smash right through if he desired. You, on the other hand\u2026\u201d The Spirit King used his finger to poke the orange-haired teen in the forehead. Ichigo felt his soul eject from his body as he stood in his Soul Reaper form. \u201cYour human body cannot exist in Soul Society. I will take care of it for now.\u201d The teenaged looking deity turned back to Jinta and pointed a finger at him. Before Jinta knew it, he was instantaneously clothed in some new fabrics. He once again wore a plain white shirt, except it was larger to fit his new body. His jeans were darker and had a lot more pockets. \u201cYou weren\u2019t going to punish the Soul Reapers half-naked, were you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Ha, cool! You\u2019re not so bad, Spirit Dude. Thanks for saving me and stuff, but I\u2019ll be going now. Come on you two!\u201d Jinta called for his slaves as he ran into the rip. Ichigo and Hisagi followed their master and the rip closed behind them. The Spirit King knew he had allowed calamity to happen, but it was less calamity than an existence with no one to govern it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three teenagers flew through the tunnel to Soul Society, the red head god noticed his two slaves start to return to their original size. They didn\u2019t seem to notice at all, even when Jinta plucked them up and placed them on his shoulder. With eyes forward, Jinta prepared to enter Soul Society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys ready to see Soul Society turn into Hell?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After firing the Kido Cannon things in the Soul Society had started calming down. All of the Soul Reapers had watched in joy as the blast tore a chunk out of the monstrous teen, causing him to spit up blood and slowly collapse until he disappeared completely. To the untrained eye, namely, many non seated Soul Reapers, believed that this meant the problem was solved and everything had been solved at last. They believed that their greatest task was now the rebuilding of the World of the Living and the altering of the human's memories. However, the more attuned Soul Reapers felt uneasy. The teen's spiritual pressure had disappeared completely, something that should not have been possible. They had watched and he had not exhibited any of his powers over reality as he had done before. Therefore, it was unlikely he had disappeared into a different dimension or hidden himself between dimensions. It was also impossible that he had been destroyed. If that were the case, the massive amount of spiritual pressure he would have released would have been visible in the severity of its release. The day passed, and every moment they were expecting a reprisal of Jinta's previous survivability and appear again to continue his reign of terror. When nothing happened they started relaxing, believing that, perhaps, it really was over. Tasks were reassigned, and the healing of the World of the Living was scheduled to be started the next day at noon. The very hour that Jinta would be arriving inside the Soul Society itself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day started out much the same as it had before Jinta. The Fourth Squad was going to be incredibly busy the next few weeks, healing the casualties of human and Soul Reaper alike, while half of the other squads were deployed for memory erasing. The other half continued normal duties, slaying Hollows, researching Hueco Mundo, and other such things. Captain Kurotsuchi, eager to continue research into the slime that caused this whole mess, was denied his desires as Yamamoto commanded him to destroy everything relating to it so that nothing of this kind could be repeated. Kurotsuchi had hoped to smuggle at least some of his data away but was unable to as Yamamoto kept a close eye on him the entire time. So it came to be that the mad scientist was unable to continue studying the object he was most interested in making it a bit of a hazard to be around him at the moment. Needless to say, Nemu was feeling the full brunt of his annoyance. The morning hours ticked by and the Soul Reapers prepared to make their way out into the World of the Living. Just as the portal was opening, something far larger and far more impressive opened above their heads. The Soul Reapers looked up in horror as their worst nightmares seemed to come to life. An enormous rift in space time appeared above their heads, two gargantuan bare feet appearing inside of it, slowly lowering down towards them. All military training forgotten, the Soul Reapers scattered like the insects they were, panicking as they realized their lives were forfeit now that Jinta had arrived. The feet touched down lightly on the ground, sending tremors rocketing around the area, fissures appearing in the concrete as Soul Reapers were thrown from their feet. Dozens had gotten trapped under Jinta's descending feet and had been utterly obliterated. Those that survived gazed up in awe of Jinta's form. The same realization that had struck so many people before them manifested in their minds. They knew he had been huge but...seeing him in person was a whole other experience. A few still attempted escape but the vast majority just laid still, no will in their bodies to defy this god that stood before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta smirked down at the chaos his mere arrival had caused, watching a few the specks attempting to escape. He decided to demonstrate some of his power before speaking to the Soul Reapers about their follies. Casually raising his hand he attracted every single one of the fleeing germs using his gravity powers and held them in his godly palm. The Soul Reapers huddled together in fear, staring into the hard eyes of the god teen. Jinta shook his head in disappointment and said, \"You think you bugs can get away from me, your god and master? IDIOTS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shouted this last word with such force it blew half the crowd away, sending their broken bodies into the ground. The other half was rendered deaf by the purposeful force he applied, making sure his voice resonated deeply in their ears while protecting the ears of his loyal slaves. He opened his mouth and drew in breath, sucking up the Soul Reapers and swallowing them. It was much like swallowing crumbs. Not particularly satisfying. He put his hands on his hips and looked down at the other assembled bugs. \"Alright Soul Reapers! Listen up! I know the full force of you aren't here, but I also know that you can here me no matter where you currently are! Yesterday you tried to do the impossible. You tried to kill a GOD! Guess what? You failed! Big time! Now I'm going to make sure every single one of you suffer as much as possible! This whole dimension is going down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his powers of control, he barked the order, \"STAND!\" and all the fallen Soul Reapers before him quickly stood up and gazed upward. There tiny necks were straining, unable to see beyond God Jinta's toes, his body an indomitable force far, far, far above them. Once they were all standing Jinta made them rise to his face. What appeared to be a dark cloud of mites surround Jinta's head, his eyes looking over his captives. \"Is this it? You're a bunch of low level weaklings! You're not even worth a nanosecond of my time! I could break and humiliate you if I was my old size!\" He used the word \"old\" rather the word \"normal\". Jinta no longer considered his puny child size his normal size. His ever growing body was now the norm and he didn't even want to consider what his life had been like before this time. He was reborn, a budding god soon to be God of everyone and everything. He directed the Soul Reapers into a clump and got a small mouthful. He swallowed it like a pill and sighed in disappointment. Totally not satisfying. No struggle, no hope of survival, nothing. Boring in the extreme. He turned his attention to the Soul Society at large and headed toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll over the Soul Society panic was ensuing. Jinta was so big that the massive Seireitei was the size of a large city to him. In other words, slightly larger than his feet. He snorted at the pathetic display of the Soul Reapers. This is what had plagued him these last few days? This was his once greatest threat? A meandering crowd of specks? He glared at the collection of buildings, not caring he had destroyed a massive amount of the Rukon District just by standing, and said, \"I could utterly destroy all of you with a few steps and all my problems would be over. But that's too quick, too painless for you. I'm going to savor this victory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cracked his knuckles, a sound like thunder to the Soul Reapers, and decided what to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cIs this really Soul Society?\u201d Jinta asked himself, looking down at the ground far beneath him. He could see the rundown, dirty districts that surrounded the more stunning architecture of Seireitei. The Soul Reapers didn\u2019t seem to run a very fair realm. \u201cThis is where I was going to go when I died? No thanks!\u201d Jinta shouted as he stomped a large portion of the town flat under his foot. When he lifted his foot to examine the wreckage, he saw that he had also crushed half a group of fleeing Soul Reapers. The remaining troops got back to their feet and resumed their escape, but Jinta would have none of that. The god lifted the men up to his face just as he did the many before and looked over the mass of flies evilly. The Soul Reapers felt so helpless before the titanic intruder. Some didn\u2019t even know where he had come from, having heard nothing of the situation in the World of the Living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what should I do with you bugs? You wanna join your comrades in digestion?\u201d Jinta asked, grinning and rubbing his stomach to taunt the petty mortals. He took great pleasure in listening to their pleas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, please! I didn\u2019t have anything to do with the Kido Cannon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just became a Soul Reaper! Th-they forced me into it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just about to be promoted to 7th Seat! This can\u2019t be happening!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! I have a wife and kids! Spare us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta chuckled deeply. These specks actually thought he cared about their worries. Who gives a care about a pitiful bug? Still, Jinta knew these specks didn\u2019t make for an appetizing meal, so he could at least play with them for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bugs wanna live?\u201d He asked, earning him an immediate nod from every Soul Reaper. \u201cThen you\u2019ll live the rest of your pathetic lives as my slaves!\u201d Jinta moved a hand downward and directed all the floating slaves toward his right foot. He scattered each and every one of them across the expanse of his foot. If he had done this a couple days before, the Soul reapers would have found themselves on an endless plain of smooth skin. Now that he had the body of a teen, his foot was covered in tiny hairs that created a forest of red trees that the Soul Reapers found themselves in. Despite being on the same foot, the Soul Reapers were miles away from each other and lost among the crimson trees. A mighty voice above them broke the silence and commanded \u201cRub!\u201d. So that\u2019s what they did. Each minor Soul Reaper got onto their hands and knees and began rubbing the god\u2019s flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jinta had given the order, he spotted another group of fleeing Soul Reapers. Put a giant in their home and these soldiers just fall apart. Jinta lifted them up, gave them the same deal, and placed them on his left foot. The red head put his hands on his hips and gazed down at his feet. He smiled not only at the Soul Reaper\u2019s lack of resistance, but also their stupidity. Like hell  he was going to spare them! Anyone who actually has the nerve to HURT him doesn\u2019t deserve to live. He was going to use the Soul Reapers and then dispose of them like trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta soon found standing idly boring and began to move again. The sudden lifting of his feet sent many unexpecting \u201cslaves\u201d to their doom while others grabbed hold of the hairs to save themselves. Jinta took small steps, not wanting to demolish Soul Society too quickly. He came upon another group of bugs, but these weren\u2019t fleeing. They instead fought Jinta and hurled kido blasts at his toes while others actually tried slashing them. The swords broke upon impact and the kido felt like gusts of warm air. Jinta raised his hand above the attacking Soul Reapers and used his gravity manipulation to gather them all into his hand. What to do with them? Maybe he could have them clean his teeth and then swallow them when they were done. Or, maybe he should drop them in his hair and tell them to clean the dandruff out before brushing them out like <b>they</b> were dandruff. In the end, Jinta thought of something else. He didn\u2019t know where the idea came from, but it seemed to be a good one. It was probably his new teenaged hormones that made him open the front of his pants and drop the frightened little bugs into his boxers. The specks were scattered among his member, balls, and pubes. When Jinta closed his jeans, he immediately felt the little Soul Reapers struggle against his privates. Even as a giant, Jinta could feel every one of the hundreds of bugs that wiggled to free themselves. Jinta started to like the feeling and watched a tent form in the front of his pants. He had gotten hardons before, but this felt different somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess this is what happens when you go from being a child to a teen in under ten minutes and skip puberty all together.\u201d Jinta laughed, reaching down and patting his organ through his pants, accidentally squashing several Soul Reapers against it. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta had had these kinds of experiences before but he had to admit this was...a new experience. He had never cared too much about girls or guys for that matter in that \"special\" way but he had heard stories about it, some from Urahara (in a rather ham handed manner) and mostly from day time television shows. He knew that he would eventually get strange feelings as his body changed but he had never really knew what these feelings would be like. Thus far they were quite...nice. It was a tingling sensation that shot through his whole body, his dick slowly stiffening and getting longer. The more the Soul Reapers scurried around on his giant organ the nicer it felt. Hot and cold sensations cascaded throughout his body. He touched his privates and was shocked by the wave of pleasure that shot through his body. This was nothing like his hard on before. He moaned a little, his knees bending as he felt the sensations get stronger. His dick was straining against the material of his jeans causing discomfort and slight pain to the teenage god. He clumsily undid the button on his jeans and his hard on pushed the zipper down. He looked down, his breathing starting to get faster, and saw his dick reveal itself through the flap of his boxer. Several Soul Reapers fell to their doom as they suddenly found themselves bobbing slowly up and down outside. Jinta poked experimentally at his cock and winced again at the pleasure that coursed through his body. This was unlike anything he had ever experienced before. He reached down, totally ignoring the horrified screams as his hand closed around his shaft, smashing hundreds more Soul Reapers into his young flesh. He slowly stroked himself, his hand moving back and forth, sending Soul Reapers flying left and right off his privates while others were crushed under his uncaring palm. The good feelings increased in his body and he moaned louder this time. Those still within the Seireitei and Rukon District watched as the destructive god stroked a penis that could crush any building in the Soul Society a hundred times over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta looked down at himself as he stroked and growled in frustration at the inabilities of his slaves. As soon as his hand had lowered on his organ the Soul Reapers had fallen into total disarray. There were plenty of areas on his dick that were perfectly safe, and yet everyone was panicking. He waved his hand casually at his shoulder and Ichigo and Hisagi flew down onto his dick head, safe from his hand and on the most sensitive area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right you two! Show these pathetic insects how you pleasure a god!\" He ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo and Hisagi both fell to their knees and replied, \"At once Lord Jinta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word Ichigo and Hisagi began rallying the other Soul Reapers into position. A few choice threats, some promises of reward, and a little violence was all it took to put order into the shattered minds of the Soul Reapers. This morning they had been fully functioning beings with hopes, dreams, and a purpose. Now they were merely tools to be used and disposed of by a being far greater than themselves. They all worked hard, rubbing and licking Jinta's sensitive cock flesh until he was moaning in pure delight. Within a few minutes beads of pre cum began to leak out of his slit and fall into the Seireitei. It was total pandemonium. Each drop caused massive damage and flooded entire sections of the Seireitei. The smell was unbelievable. Not a single person in the Seireitei was even thinking of following orders. Most were running for their lives. Jinta continued moaning and rubbing himself, pleasure shooting through his bodies and making his legs weak. He almost fell to his knees at one point but managed to stay upright. Ichigo and Hisagi were doing an amazing job organizing the other slaves, giving Jinta maximum pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his balls tightened and he felt his whole body tense. With one last exclamation of ecstasy he shot his first ever load. The sticky white mess flew for miles and miles, splattering an uninhabited area of the Soul Society. Noticing this, Jinta grinned and evil grin and aimed his cock down so that the pulsating slit was aimed directly at the Seireitei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how you specks deal with MY cannon!\" He panted out, feeling the next load racing along his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe released fully upon the Soul Society, once, twice, three times. Each shot devastated the area, completely destroying buildings, murdering people on impact, and flooding the Seireitei with Jinta's essence. When he was finally done shooting his loads there was nothing left but a few crooked remains hidden under an ocean of his seed. Even the smallest workings of his body devastated everyone and everything around him. Truly he was a force to be reckoned with. Jinta wiped his forehead and saw what damage he had done and laughed. He laughed long and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! I can't believe it! That was amazing! In one act of pleasure you all were finished off by me! That's just so hilarious!\" He roared out, totally humiliating anyone still alive. He wiped his eyes and sighed, looking down at his softening dick. He called up Ichigo and Hisagi and brought them to his face. \"Excellent work as always carrot top! You too sixty nine face! You're really proving yourself as useful as carrot top!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens bowed as best they could suspended in mid air and thanked their god for his kind words. Jinta waved his hand and the two settled on his shoulder once more. Turning his attention back to his dick and balls he held out his hand and called all the Soul Reapers there onto his palm along with the Soul Reapers still scurrying around on his feet. He grinned at them and said, \"Well you guys really proved yourselves useful today! I'm impressed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone on the palm sighed in relief. They had done it. Their god was pleased and they wouldn't be punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, I think I'll give you all a nice round of applause!\" He said, the malicious intent clear on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Soul Reapers could only look up in disbelief, horror, awe, and resignation as the teen brought his hands together, crushing the life out of the Soul Reapers in a second. He clapped his hands a few times to make sure no one would survive, cleaned his hands using his powers, and surveyed the area. He had done it. One of the major threats to his rule had been demolished. All that left was Grimmjow trapped in the void, Hueco Mundo, and Hitsugaya and Renji, wherever they were. Jinta looked at the drying remains of his first ejaculation and wondered if those two had been somewhere in there. He shrugged and scratched his stomach unconcernedly. He would deal with those two when and if he happened upon them. In the meantime there was a false god he needed to punish and destroy. He opened a rift back to the World of the Living and stepped through it, leaving nothing but destruction in his wake. When he was the true God of all creation he would create a new heaven in place of the Soul Society, a heaven dedicated to serving him and his body. As Jinta stepped back onto the soil of the planet he knew so well he took a deep breath and said, \"It's good to be back! Now, time to deal with the kitten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his hand and prepared to open a portal to the void.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta brought his fingers together and slowly spread them apart. The movement signaled the fabric of space and time to \u201cmove aside\u201d as a small hole opened in front of him. The hole was just big enough for Jinta to take a peak in. He wanted to get a look at his captive before he decimated him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHellooo! Anyone home?\u201d Jinta called, looking through the eyehole he created. His reply was a thunderous roar that cracked the spatial area around the hole. Jinta wasn\u2019t the least bit intimidated, though, and stepped back. He watched two hands emerge from the hole and grip its edges. The owner of those hands forcibly pulled the hole open; making it wider and big enough to fit through. Grimmjow stepped out of the exit when the tear was big enough and let go, allowing the ruin space to slowly repair itself. The blue-haired Arrancar glared hatefully at Jinta as they both studied the changes they had undergone. Grimmjow, obviously, noticed that the boy was much bigger than before. He had done some growing in the void and had hoped to tower over Jinta when he was free, but was unfortunately only at equal height to the boy\u2019s belly. He also noticed the giant\u2019s older appearance. How long was he in the void?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you look so much older? I was only in that place for a week\u2026two tops!\u201d Grimmjow asked, looking up at Jinta who was smiling down at him. It took a lot of control to not smash that face in right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeeks? Slow down, pussy. You\u2019ve only been in there a couple days.\u201d Jinta corrected while he studied the older man\u2019s changes. He was a bit bigger, but still shrimpy compared to him. What really stood out was the guy\u2019s muscles. They were much bigger than he remembered; almost as if the Arrancar had taken some bodybuilding lessons while in the void. What remained of his clothes were barely fitting on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA couple days? Impossible! I could have sworn it was longer than that! Time must past differently there. It felt like I--\u201d Grimmjow began to rant, but stopped when he got a whiff of the air. Jinta had cleaned himself, but the smaller god\u2019s superior sense of smell could detect the stench of Soul Reapers and sex. \u201cWhat exactly have you been doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? Nothing much. I just got back from completely OWNING Soul Society. Kinda like I\u2019m gonna do to you.\u201d Jinta replied, placing his hands on his hips and continuing to stare Grimmjow down. His reply had brought a smile to the Hollow\u2019s face. While he hated the kid\u2019s guts, the idea that he had brought ruin to the Soul Reapers was something to be impressed by. Still, he hated his guts, so\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really? You\u2019re going to own me this time? I\u2019m not some weak Soul Reaper, brat! I\u2019m the real god and I\u2019m going to show you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring it on, kitty!\u201d Jinta said before he ran at Grimmjow, bent down, and delivered a straight punch right to his abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the greatest idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw! Ow! Ow!\u201d Jinta yelped as he removed his fist and began waving it in the air. He blew hot air on it while Grimmjow just looked up in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to break through my Hierro with wimpy punches like that? <b>This</b> is how you punch somebody!\u201d Grimmjow drew back his fist as his muscles tensed. Jinta knew he was planning to punch him in the gut like last time and using his palm to catch the punch before it collided. However, this only resulted in the back of his own hand being jammed into his stomach along with Grimmjow\u2019s fist. Jinta hacked up some blood before he was sent backwards, rolling across the forest area, crushing trees as he went. He finally stopped and immediately rushed at Grimmjow for another assault. The teen punched and kicked everywhere, but every blow was simply brushed off. \u201cThat all you got? Give me a REAL hit, kid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta started to get furious as his eyes slit up in rage. He wanted a real hit? So be it! The red head slammed his hand into the ground and used his powers to collect the earth around him. Grimmjow didn\u2019t know what the brat was doing, but got ready to deliver a kick to the boy\u2019s stomach that should definitely mess him up. Before he could, Jinta pulled his hand out of the earth and the Arrancar felt something incredibly hard hit him in the face. The blow was enough to send Grimmjow off his feet and onto his side. Jinta stood up to his full height and grinned down at the false god. The hand he had punched Grimmjow with slammed into his open palm. It was covered in molten earth, creating something similar to a boxing glove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice shot.\u201d Grimmjow complimented as he got to his feet and wiped the blood off his face. The hit had managed split his lip and dislocate his jaw, but it was far from permanent. Jinta watched his opponent\u2019s regeneration abilities in action as his lip healed and his jaw popped back into place. The healing was much faster than before, too. With a tougher body and the ability to heal any wound Jinta manages to inflict; was it even possible to defeat this guy? Jinta started to think about trapping him again, but what good would that do? He\u2019d just be even stronger the next time he was let out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow would be a good idea for you bugs to come up with a plan.\u201d Jinta told the two Soul Reapers on his shoulder. The two teens nodded in understanding and started to formulate a plan. Grimmjow wasn\u2019t going to just wait, though, and jumped at Jinta. The Arrancar tackled the teen to the ground and started pounding his face in while laughing dementedly. Jinta tossed the smaller giant off him, but only after a black eye decorated his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat looks good on you. Now for the other one!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust try, stupid kitten!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grimmjow held his position for a moment, noticing the two small specks on his opponents shoulder. He focused his sharp eyes on them and saw two Soul Reapers. One was a guy with a sixty nine tattoo that he didn't recognize or care to recognize but the other speck was someone very familiar to him. He'd recognize that spiky orange hair anywhere. He grinned maniacally. This was too good. Not only was he destroying the boy that had imprisoned him but he could now punish that pathetic excuse for a fighter Ichigo Kurosaki. He darted forward and reached out his hand. Jinta, thinking he was coming in for another punch, blocked his face. Grimmjow stuck his hand through the gap in the boy's arms and deftly snatched Ichigo into his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo had never even seen it coming. He was too deep in a conversation with Hisagi. They had been bouncing ideas back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Lord Jinta could find some way to trap Grimmjow in a place where his body was being constantly destroyed he could be contained.\" Hisagi suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the problem! He would be trapped until he became strong enough to break free and then cause Lord Jinta more problems!\" Ichigo countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, you're right...\" Hisagi said in a dejected voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo thought about it for a second and suddenly snapped his fingers, \"I've got an idea! Remember how Lord Jinta siphoned the water off of himself after he was done bathing? Maybe he could draw the slime out of Grimmjow in the same way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi nodded slowly. \"That's not a bad idea. Let's tell it to Lord Jinta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, before either of them could so much as twitch, a massive hand enveloped Ichigo's body, stealing it from Jinta's shoulder. From Hisagi's perspective Ichigo was in front of him one second and totally gone in the next, the only thing separating the two moments being a wall of peach colored skin. From Ichigo's perspective, he was just suddenly surrounded by immense heat and darkness. His heart pounded furiously as he felt himself pulled away from the safety of his god and master. Grimmjow had often outclassed him when they were normal size. Now...he didn't even want to think about it. Grimmjow slowly opened his hand and grinned down at the speck in his grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well, if it isn't my once rival Ichigo. Not much to look at now are you? Crushing you now would be meaningless. After I'm done killing your so called god over there I'm making you my own slave. Get ready to serve a real god you pathetic insect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo could only tremble in the massive Arrancar's grip as his spiritual pressure bore down on him like an insurmountable weight. The cold eyes above him were not like that of Jinta's, which held warmth and strength, but the eyes of one who only lives to bring pain and destruction. To be fair, Jinta did the same but he was good to those who submitted to him. Grimmjow wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta was surprised when he didn't feel the concrete like fist blasting into his body and looked at Grimmjow. He seemed to be talking to his hand...His eyes suddenly shot wide and he looked over at his shoulder. There was only one speck there. Hisagi was jumping up and down and shouting, \"He's got Ichigo! Save him Lord Jinta! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta growled with a feral noise in his throat and said, \"You miserable excuse for a false god! You'll pay for stealing my slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow grinned up at Jinta and said, \"He's mine now kid! I'm going to break him totally by forcing him to watch me slowly torture you to death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta scoffed and said, \"Not going to happen! Now prepare yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi hung on to Jinta's shoulder and shouted, \"Lord Jinta! Ichigo and I came up with a plan! Try using your powers to siphon the slime out of Grimmjow's system! That would return him to normal and be easily destroyed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta grinned and said, \"Great plan sixty nine man! Let's give it a whirl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta ran forward and sliced through reality, closing a rift over Grimmjow's ankle. The foot was neatly severed sending Grimmjow down on one knee. He growled in annoyance and shoved Ichigo downs his pants, tangling Ichigo into his bright blue pubes. His foot quickly regrew and he punched at Jinta. Jinta barely managed to avoid it, one of the knuckles grazing him and bruising his side. He concentrated and used his gravity powers to lift Grimmjow into the air. He only managed to lift him to twice his own height before he started straining too much. He brought the Hollow down with all the force he could, sweat starting to bead on his forehead, his breathing getting heavier. The force of Grimmjow slamming into the ground caused the Earth to warp and crack around him for miles and miles. Grimmjow spat out a wad of blood and said, \"Not bad. You cracked a few ribs on that one.\" He stood up and winced again. \"Dammit, you ruptured something in there. I'll be fine in a minute though. You need to really hit harder. This won't be much fun at all otherwise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta smirked and said, \"Then try this one!\" He ran forward and slid between Grimmjow's legs, cutting a hole in reality behind him. Grimmjow fell through and back into the cursed void. Moving swiftly he opened the void above him and Grimmjow's momentum brought him into Jinta's arms. He wrapped his arms around him, holding him tight to his body. Grimmjow laughed loudly. \"Damn you're stupid kid! Do you think you're strong enough to hold me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta tightened his grip and said, \"Nope, but I don't need to hold you for long.\" He began using his powers to search for the slime particles in Grimmjow's body. As Grimmjow began to struggle to free himself, which was harder than he expected it to be, Jinta managed to find the particles attached to his various cells. Using all the force he could muster he began to separate it, bringing it up to the surface of Grimmjow's body and pushing it out through his skin pores. Grimmjow could feel the slimy texture his skin was getting shouted, \"What the hell are you doing? Let go of me you little bastard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta held on for as long as he could before losing his grip. The only question was, how successful was he?</span></div></div>",

It was the last push needed to make Jinta let go of him. Grimmjow did a flip in the air and landed in front of the teenaged giant. He stood up and his eyes bulged when he noticed he was now leveled with the boy\u2019s crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn you! I lost some of my size!\u201d the Arrancar cursed, looking down at his skin and seeing the oozing slime drip down to the ground. The slime appeared darker than it was when he consumed it, probably meaning it was now inactive and dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a feeling that\u2019s not all you lost.\u201d Jinta said as he took Grimmjow\u2019s attention away from himself just in time to see the boy\u2019s fist collide with his cheek. Grimmjow felt the bones in his jaw shatter as he was sent flying back into a nearby mountain range. Jinta blew on his knuckles and rubbed it against his shirt. Grimmjow\u2019s skin wasn\u2019t as hard anymore; but it was still like hitting a brick wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Hierro!\u201d Grimmjow cried as he picked himself up. \u201cHow did you\u2026damn it!\u201d The spiky haired man popped his jaw back in place, showing that his healing abilities weren\u2019t damaged at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re not so tough anymore.\u201d Jinta said, looking at the Arrancar as he would any other bug. \u201cI just have to grab you a few more times and you\u2019ll be small enough for me to dispose of. Can\u2019t wait!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get so cocky!!\u201d Grimmjow retaliated by charging a cero and firing at the giant boy. Jinta merely opened a portal in the beam\u2019s path and it disappeared into nothingness. He yawned and opened another portal above the false god. Knowing what was coming, Grimmjow dodged to the side just a  his cero hit the ground he was once standing on and turning the mountain range into a smoking crater. When he was safe, he returned to glaring at the snotty brat. \u201cI may have lost my defense, but I can still heal from anything you do to me! Meanwhile, if I blast your arm off\u2026it\u2019s gone forever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a really dumb cat.\u201d Jinta said, shaking his head in disappointment. \u201cYou might be able to heal, but what will happen if I crush your arms and legs and then grab you again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow paused for a moment before cursing under his breath. This kid could easily turn his limbs to mush and while they were regenerating, he\u2019d be siphoning the slime from his body! Those few seconds he had spent in the god\u2019s grasp had cost him his greatest advantage. Things were looking bleak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to do that, though. Just stand still and let me get all that slime out of you. If you do that; I promise to make your end swift.\u201d Jinta offered as he slowly approached Grimmjow, cracking his knuckles as he did. He loved that sound; it was like a bad omen to those that heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew you!\u201d Grimmjow replied before reaching his hand into his pants, removing Ichigo, and dangling the teen above his mouth. This made Jinta stop dead in his tracks. \u201cOne more move and I\u2019ll be picking your carrot top from my teeth!\u201d The Sexta Espada snapped his teeth menacingly, frightening Ichigo even more and causing anger to shoot through Jinta\u2019s veins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou coward! You don\u2019t deserve to be even a false god! \u201c Jinta clenched his fist, unknowingly causing the space around him to ripple from the weight of his spiritual pressure. \u201cForget what I said about a quick death. You hurt my slave and I\u2019ll make your death is as long and painful as possible!\u201d The red head\u2019s eyes were filled with anger. They flared up like fire and could probably burn a hole in reality if he stared long enough. It was a look his slaves had never seen before. It was making even Grimmjow a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well, I won\u2019t have to do it if you do as I want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta folded his arms across his chest and said, \u201cAnd what do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor you to leave me alone. Let me do my own thing. We can both be gods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot in a million years!\u201d Jinta responded almost immediately. \u201cI can\u2019t let scum like you waltz around my world doing whatever he pleases. I\u2019ll be really pissed if you kill carrot top; but if his death is the only way to put an end to you, then I don\u2019t really mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow\u2019s mouth twitched. His hostage plan wasn\u2019t going as planned. Ichigo, however, didn\u2019t seem surprised at all. He would gladly die if it meant he was helping his god. He just wished he wasn\u2019t being sacrificed to a dark god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, then how about this? You leave me alone for a set amount of time. After that time\u2019s up, we\u2019ll continue our fight and I\u2018ll return Ichigo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want me to give you some time to live? I don\u2019t think a bad kitten like you deserves that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta rubbed his chin as he thought about it. It wouldn\u2019t take much effort to overwhelm Grimmjow again and drain him of the slime. He could end this now and be done with it. However, there was a high chance the Substitute Soul Reaper\u2019s life would be forfeit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, he could give Grimmjow his last moments to do as he pleased. There wasn\u2019t much he could do. Even if he did build up some more power over time, Jinta would just trap him in another bear hug and they\u2019d be right back to where they started. The idea of Grimmjow playing with HIS slave on HIS planet sickened him, but it was better than losing said slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Jinta made his decision and said\u2026</span></div></div>",

This kid...what an arrogant idiot. This was going to give him plenty of time to think up a plan to kill this so called god. If nothing else it would give him some time to regain his power. He couldn't shape reality like Jinta and without as much of the slime he would gain power slowly. Still, he had managed to outwit the kid and that was a good start towards beating him completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there are some stipulations to it. My slave better be in totally perfect condition when you return him to me. If there's so much as a scratch on him I'll make you suffer like you've never suffered before.\" That look flashed in his eyes and Grimmjow actually stepped back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I'm only giving you half a day. When the sun sets tonight that's it. I'm going to find you, you'll return carrot top to me, and we'll fight again, this time winner takes all. No tricks, no traps, just pure one on one fighting. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" Grimmjow said turning and heading off somewhere to enjoy his freedom. He dangled Ichigo in front of his eyes and said, \"You're lucky little bug. I was looking forward to eating you and adding your tiny mass to my body. Oh well, after I beat down your master that sixty nine guy will make a good crumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and deposited Ichigo back into his pants. Ichigo was further down the cock this time, the jungle of pubes a ways behind him while the length and cock head stretched out before him. He sighed and grabbed his knees, burying his head into them. He was miserable. He had been separated from his god. Worse, he might even have caused his god trouble by merely existing. That was the ultimate dishonor he could imagine. He made a promise to himself. When he got back to Jinta he was going to make up for this event by being the greatest slave Lord Jinta had. He would make sure no one could take his place when it came to serving. Until then, he would endure this trial of his faith. He wouldn't give in to the false god that now held him no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Grimmjow moved away Jinta smirked at his retreating back. Idiot. There was no way that he was going to get stronger than him. Jinta knew that Grimmjow probably had some kind of plan to defeat him. He wanted to make sure the Arrancar's hopes were nice and high before he crushed them completely, destroying him and showing the world that there could be only one god and that god was Jinta. He looked down at his shoulder and saw Hisagi looked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sixty nine man! Don't look so glum! In a few hours carrot top will be back, Grimmjow will be dead, and I'll continue my conquest of this world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi smiled up at his god and said, \"You're right Lord Jinta! I have total faith in your amazing abilities! What do you plan to do in the meantime if I may ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta thought about it and suddenly remembered his other mission. \"Oh yeah, those two Soul Reapers...moocher and the kid...whatever their names are. I need to find and take care of them. Hmm...I wonder where they could be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi raised his voice and said, \"If I may my Lord, since they've been dealing with Urahara there's a good chance they weren't in the Seireitei when you destroyed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta nodded and said, \"Makes sense. They're probably still around what's left of Karakura Town. I'm going to head back that way. It shouldn't take long to get there.\" Jinta grinned and began walking, taking his time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One would think Grimmjow would be pacing aimlessly trying to figure out a way out of this mess. However, the Arrancar had spent (to him) over a week inside the void doing absolutely nothing but growing ore powerful. He saw nothing but himself, heard nothing but himself, and even smelled nothing but his own body odor. He planned to take all his anger out on Jinta. He\u2019d make that immature brat into his slave for him to torture to his heart\u2019s content before putting an end to his worthless life. That didn\u2019t seem possible now and things were quickly taking a turn for the worse. Still, Grimmjow needed something to have some fun with. With the weak Soul Reapers finished, the only thing left was the even weaker humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow came upon one of the human\u2019s little settlements and grinned down at them. The civilians had heard the giant\u2019s footsteps approaching and were expecting the red haired god they had heard about. Instead, they looked up at an older and far more intimidating giant. The blue haired destroyer\u2019s sadistic grin told them they were all doomed. Few tried to run when Grimmjow stepped into the city, crushing several blocks under his socked and sandaled feet. He could hear the cries and prayers of the tiny bugs much like Jinta could. He enjoyed listening to them and then hearing them suddenly stopped when he obliterated them underfoot. A loud grumbling came from the Arrancar\u2019s abs and he scratched them with a hungry look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had nothing to eat in days! I\u2019m famished!\u201d the Espada declared as he scooped up a handful of people, concrete, and metal and stuffed them all into his open maw. The survivors below could hear him chew nosily before swallowing and reaching down for another handful. Unlike Jinta, Grimmjow was a far messier eater. He slurped and sucked on the contents of his mouth as he chewed it, making the humans below sick to their stomachs. Lots of drool dripped down his chest before splattering on the ground below. Much of the drool contained people that had been saved from becoming food, only to either drown or fall to their doom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Grimmjow was full he released a mighty belch that everyone, including Jinta, could hear for miles. Grimmjow laid himself down on the ruins of the city; his back crushing any and all possible survivors. For the first time since taking that slime, Grimmjow felt relaxed and invincible. It was only a matter of time before Jinta came for him and brushed all that aside. Reaching into his pants, Grimmjow felt around for the tiny Ichigo. He located the little speck and brought him in front of his face again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake in the view, Kurosaki. They\u2019ll be a lot more places like this in the future.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah right. Lord Jinta is going to smite you before that happens!\u201d Ichigo yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Lord Jinta will be shown his place eventually. I\u2019m going to turn him into my slave just like I will you. There can only be one God and that\u2019s gonna be me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo was getting pissed. How dare Grimmjow think of himself so highly when he was but a bug in the eyes of Jinta? Raising his voice even more, Ichigo shouted, \u201cWhen are you going to face reality?! You can\u2019t defeat Lord Jinta! It\u2019s already been a little over a half hour and your power hasn\u2019t increased an inch. Just give up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem with you, Kurosaki. You give up too easily. That\u2019s how you went from a proud Soul Reaper that at least deserved to be called a fighter, to <b>this</b>. You should have died with your pride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo tried to ignore the false god. Speaking of his old life was pointless. The world had changed when Lord Jinta stepped into it and this was his life now. He didn\u2019t care about anything but pleasing his god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to live like a maggot? Fine.\u201d Grimmjow said as he placed Ichigo on his chest between his pecs. \u201cBe a good slave and lick my chest. I got it a little messy when I was eating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u2019 Ichigo replied, glaring up into the eyes of his captor. He would never serve this wicked god. His tongue was meant for Jinta and Jinta alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave it your way.\u201d The 6th Espada looked down at Ichigo a bit before he started to flex his pectorals. Ichigo watched the two mounds of muscle move and flex and sometimes brush against each other. He was planning to crush him between his massive pecs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou promised you weren\u2019t going to hurt me! Didn\u2019t you hear Lord Jinta?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, you think I care what that brat says? Would you get scared if a kid started screaming at you because you knocked over his ice cream?\u201d Grimmjow asked as he continued to press his chest muscles closer and closer together. To Ichigo, it was like the walls were closing in on him. The idea of never seeing his master again and ending up as a red dot on his worst enemies\u2019 chest was horrifying. His human will to survive started to kick in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d Ichigo yelled with tears in his eyes as he got on his hands and knees and started to lick Grimmjow\u2019s flesh. With every lick he silently asked Jinta to forgive him. Grimmjow smiled and relaxed his muscles. With Ichigo nothing but a sniveling bug I his broad chest, Grimmjow turned his attention to his own thoughts. It was time to put his mind into overdrive. There were a few things he could do to get a step above Jinta, but he needed a concrete plan. Something that couldn\u2019t fail. Failure meant certain death.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Grimmjow thought through his options (which weren't many) Ichigo continued crawling along on the Espada's humongous chest. This was totally different from the time he had served Jinta. With Jinta, it had been a harsh experience that ended in his total exhaustion but was a baptism of sorts. He had fallen asleep and awoken a new man with a new purpose. Jinta had welcomed him into a special fold and he had become the slave of a merciful god. With Grimmjow...it was a baptism of fire. His skin was hard and cold despite the heat baking off the massive creature, making Ichigo shiver slightly as he crawled. Glancing up showed nothing but the harsh and unforgiving face of a being of pure chaotic evil and destruction. There was no mercy here. Ichigo knew that if Grimmjow was his god he would be used and abused until he was killed for the sheer enjoyment of it. But that wasn't going to happen. Jinta was his true lord and god and he was going to stay that way. While Grimmjow was stagnant, thus far, in his gain of power, Jinta had proved in the past that he was constantly changing on a daily basis. Ichigo smiled as he imagined Jinta growing into an even greater god, rising up in the distance to completely crush Grimmjow and bring his slave back into his bosom. He was so engrossed in this fantasy that he didn't notice the taste of Grimmjow's skin being replaced by something foreign. Even if he had been paying attention Ichigo would have believed that he was merely running tongue over debris, dirt, or even remains of human flesh and blood. However, it wasn't any of these things. It was the remains of the slime that Jinta and drawn out of Grimmjow's body. Grimmjow hadn't bothered to scrape it off since it was all just inactive muck anyway, not worth his time. A lot of it had shed off his body as he moved and ate, so that only a trace amount of it remained. Of course, it was a trace amount to the gigantic Arrancar. For Ichigo, there were sizable globs of it all over. If Grimmjow had bothered to look closer as well he would have noticed that, amongst the inactive slime, there were still globs of perfectly functioning slime. These globs would have been inconsequential to Grimmjow, barely effecting his development. To Ichigo, however, it would be far more consequential. He lapped up whole globs of it, swallowing it down into his stomach where the slime swiftly began spreading throughout his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime, while only having a fixed dosage, had the ability to replicate itself inside the body of the one who ingested it. When Grimmjow drank the slime he had a small bottle full. The slime replicated itself, making weaker copies that spread through the body, increasing the original dosage millions of times over. Each new copy was slightly weaker than the copy before it, meaning that Ichigo had ingested quite a bit more than either gods but the dosages were less potent. Only time would tell if he would be a match for the gods, or merely a demi god, perhaps only a slightly ascended human. The slime soon bonded to his cells, altering them,  improving them. Ichigo had nearly scaled the entirety of Grimmjow's chest, reaching almost to his godly chin. He quickly shifted course and started going over the left pec. He knew if he didn't Grimmjow might lose his patience and just crush him completely. He glanced at the false god's face and saw his expression was one of extreme agitation. Apparently no good ideas were coming to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ichigo traced a path along the pec it seemed to be taking less time to get around which was quite strange. He seemed to be covering more distance than normal. He chalked this up to his wandering mind and his less than careful ministrations. If it had been Jinta he would have carefully licked every single millimeter of flesh spotless. With Grimmjow, he just wanted to finish as quickly as possible to be done with it. He wondered if he'd have to continued licking, moving down into the field of abs. He didn't even want to entertain the thought of dealing with Grimmjow's package. That would feel like the ultimate betrayal of Jinta. It made him feel sick to his stomach. Or at least he thought it made him sick to his stomach...but this wasn't a sick feeling...more like a tingling sensation, running through his body. It jolted through him, making his heart pound, his skin start to sweat. He stood up and fanned himself, the heat getting worse. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow slammed his fist into the ground. Dammit, that wouldn't work either! If he didn't come up with something he was as good as dead! Jinta would curb stomp him the same way he had earlier today. His reality warping powers were a force to be reckoned with. If Grimmjow so much as let Jinta touch him he would lose his powers, returning to the insect kingdom below him, easy prey for the teen god. He looked down at Ichigo, wanting to check his progress, and was shocked to see him standing, about the same size as his nipple. Now, this was, by no means, enormous...to Grimmjow. In comparison to the people below though Ichigo was a giant to be reckoned with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! What the hell Soul Reaper! What happened to you?\" Grimmjow snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked himself over in shock and said, \"How should I know? It's not like I did anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow grabbed him and brought him close to his face, \"You did something to make yourself bigger and you're going to tell me what it was you little insect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo struggled and said, \"Shut up! I didn't do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow threw him against his body, the landing bruising Ichigo. It was like landing on something harder than concrete. He got shakily to his feet and looked behind him. He had narrowly avoided falling into Grimmjow's Hollow hole. That would have been disastrous. He looked back at Grimmjow's face and saw the Arrancar reaching for him again. He jumped between his fingers and ran up the torso, passing the nipple again and noticing it was half his size. Whatever had caused him to start growing was still working on him. If he could keep avoiding Grimmjow, maybe he could escape and return to Lord Jinta...</span></div></div>",

Running toward Grimmjow\u2019s face wasn\u2019t going to end well, so Ichigo changed direction and ran up toward the Hollow\u2019s shoulder. From there he\u2019d jump off the titan\u2019s body and make a mad dash for his true god. He was just about to clamber onto the massive shoulder when an incredible weight stopped him dead. He didn\u2019t feel skin collide with him, so it wasn\u2019t Grimmjow\u2019s hand. The force brought him to his knees and then flat on his stomach. It continued to push him against Grimmjow\u2019s collarbone. It was now that Ichigo released Grimmjow was using his spiritual pressure to weigh him down. He could crush him without lifting a finger. Grimmjow eased his spiritual pressure down and snatched the weakened Soul Reaper into his hand once more. Now, however, the teen could fit into the man\u2019s fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me how you grew. Did Jinta give you something?\u201d Grimmjow asked, watching the tiny male closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I don\u2019t know how I grew. Lord Jinta would never find me worthy to share his secrets with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiar!\u201d the angry muscle head yelled as he used a couple fingers from his other hand to grip the boy\u2019s head. Ichigo struggled but his captor was too strong; he could move his head at all. \u201cTell me or I\u2019ll twist you head off!\u201d The Arrancar gave his prisoner\u2019s body a few urging squeezes as he awaited a reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! I was just licking your chest like you said and I started growing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow\u2019s eyes widened. He looked down at his muscled chest and, with some focusing, spotted several dots of glowing slime. He muttered a profanity before releasing Ichigo\u2019s head and using the same hand to wipe across his chest. The Espada brought the hand to his face and licked it clean. The added slime did nothing for him, but at least it was away from Ichigo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? It\u2019s your own damn fault!\u201d Ichigo said, getting a tight squeeze as a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut it! This doesn\u2019t change a thing. You\u2019re still nothing compared to me.\u201d Grimmjow replied, but he was a bit worried nonetheless. He could feel Ichigo\u2019s body slowly fill his hand. He might become a big annoyance if left alone. \u201cI should get rid of you before you cause me any trouble. Unless you can give me a reason not to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt means give me a reason not to crush your little bug body. You\u2019re always with that clown of giant; you must know something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetray Lord Jinta? Go to hell!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I suppose this is goodbye.\u201d Grimmjow smiled as he started to squeeze the life out of the small giant. Ichigo writhed in the Arrancar\u2019s grip and started to yell in pain. He had been given the same power as Lord Jinta, but he wouldn\u2019t live to see it to its full extent. He couldn\u2019t betray his lord. Not only because of loyalty, but also because he knew of no way to defeat Jinta. The teen was an incredible being whom few could overcome in terms of power. He had no weaknesses Ichigo knew of. Nothing he could say would appease Grimmjow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless he made something up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!! I\u2019ll tell you! I give up!\u201d Ichigo screamed, much to the spiky blue\u2019s surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? So you know of a way to defeat that brat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Ichigo muttered, gasping for breath as Grimmjow released his death grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy the sudden change of heart? Weren\u2019t you his devoted follower who would die for him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was\u2026but ever since I started growing, I can feel my old self start to emerge again. I think Jinta was brainwashing me.\u201d Ichigo lied, including each word with a mental \u2018forgive me\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then\u2026spill the beans. What\u2019s that kid\u2019s weakness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026Apples.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApples. You see, awhile ago when I was visiting Urahara\u2019s shop, I noticed everyone was having an apple when Jinta was eating a peach instead. I didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time, but it happened again and again. He\u2019d never touch an apple! One day, Kisuke stuffed an apple into the boy\u2019s mouth and he started to break out all over! He must have some kind of allergic reaction to apples!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRiiight\u2026that\u2019s a bit farfetched. How do I know your now lying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLying? I would never lie to you\u2026L-L-Lord Grimmjow.\u201d Ichigo said. His mouth felt like he had licked Grimmjow\u2019s ass instead of his chest. It seemed to work, as Grimmjow smirked at the recognition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must be desperate, but we\u2019ll try your little idea. I remember seeing an orchid of apple trees not far from here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded an mentally smirked in his head. What an idiot! He had made the whole story up. Allergic to apples? He never heard of such a thing. Anyway, a few seconds later, the giant Espada found himself in the middle of an orchid of apples. He put Ichigo down and ordered him to help pick. Ichigo did as he was told and after an hour and a half they had made a pile of nothing but shiny red apples. It was enough to feed half a town, but was barely a mouthful to the gargantuan Jinta. Grimmjow decided it was enough, though. Sometime during his work, Ichigo had stopped growing for the time being and was equal in size to Grimmjow\u2019s fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow stood up and brought Ichigo to his face. Tasking once last glace at the apples, he said, \u201cTime to see if this works. I\u2019ve thought up a plan to make it so if you\u2019re lying, I won\u2019t seem like a fool and still have some time to think of a real idea. If you ARE lying, Kurosaki, well\u2026I know <b>I\u2019m</b> not allergic to <b>you</b>.\u201d Grimmjow warned, showing Ichigo his razor sharp teeth. Ichigo started to sweat and have second thoughts about this plan\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few miles away, in the ruins of Karakura Town, Jinta sighed deeply and collapsed on the ruins of the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been searching for over an hour now. There\u2019s no sign of that bucket head or those two Soul Reapers.\u201d Jinta said to Hisagi, who rested on the teen\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard Urahara had a secret, underground training area. Maybe they\u2019re hiding out there?\u201d Hisagi suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought about that too, but\u2026\u201d Jinta surveyed the land around them. His construction of the statue had turned most of the town into a flat, bare wasteland. The rest was too destroyed to make out any landmarks. \u201cI have no idea where the shop stood\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta planned on taking a little break when his attention what caught on the sound of flapping wings. Looking up, he spotted several Hollows carrying what appeared to be a small bag of some sorts. What were they doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe noticed us. Remember what Master Grimmjow said, boys.\u201d the lead Hollow told his followers. They watched the massive form of Jinta rise to his feet and block their path with his body. Jinta looked down at the pitiful Hollows and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you punks going with that?\u201d Jinta boomed, making the Hollows sweat a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-we\u2019re just taking a bounty of humans to our leader.\u201d spoke one of them. \u201cWith Soul Society in ruins and people dying by the masses, us Hollows are having a feast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Jinta muttered. He touched his stomach and felt it rumble a bit. He was just starting to get a little hungry. \u201cYou boys are just in time. Hand over the goods; I could use a snack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? But this--\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust hand it over!\u201d Jinta commanded, snatching the bag from the Hollows' talons. Without caring to check its contents, Jinta poured the apples into his gaping mouth. He started to chew and it took him but a second to realize what it was. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta smirked as the sweet juice filled his mouth, dripping slightly down the side of his mouth. He recognized this taste. It was the delicious taste of apples fresh off the tree. His all time favorite fruit! He chewed a few more times and swallowed it down, sighing in satisfaction. The Hollow all waited anxiously to see what would happen. Jinta raised an eyebrow at them and said, \"Hey you stupid Hollows! That was a bag of apples. What are you trying to pull?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hollows all looked at each other in fear before one said, \"Uh...well....we...we just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta's expression got stormier as this exchange went on. He crossed his arms and slowly rumbled, \"It seems to me that you guys...are up to something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hollows all lost it at once. \"Every Hollow for himself! Let's get the hell out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hollows began to scatter, trying to fly away from the gargantuan teen. Jinta wasn't about to have that. He bellowed, \"FREEZE!\" and all the Hollows felt their bodies forced into compliance. Jinta gathered them all up in his palm and said, \"So this was some kind of set up huh? Well you're not about to get away with that! Besides...I'm still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hollows were helpless as Jinta opened his smirking mouth wide dumping the creatures into his waiting maw. They were about as satisfying as the humans, slightly more so since they were larger but still not much of a meal. He swallowed them without a second thought and turned to look in the direction that Grimmjow had walked off in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That false god is behind this. I wonder who gave him such a stupid idea like that. Why would apples do anything to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi's eyes suddenly widened and he shouted, \"Lord Jinta! I think I may know what's going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta turned his attention to Hisagi and said, \"Speak up sixty nine man! What's on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps Ichigo gave him the idea as a trick! It's possible Grimmjow as trying to force Ichigo to tell him a weakness of yours and Ichigo made one up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta laughed at that thought and said, \"I wouldn't put it past carrot top! He's not that stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi still had a panicked look on his face. \"But Lord Jinta! Ichigo might be in terrible danger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta rotated a finger in his ear and said, \"Yeah, you're probably right. That spiky haired kitty wouldn't keep his word anyway. Well, guess I'll just take care of him now then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to make his way over to where Grimmjow was, not knowing that Grimmjow had been watching the situation. His face was a mask of fury. He turned to the man in his hand and said, \"Well, looks like you lied to me Soul Reaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked passively up at Grimmjow and said, \"Of course! I'd never betray Lord Jinta! You're nothing more than a false god! He'd never forgive me if I submitted to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow grinned a feral grin and said, \"Then submit to my stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shoved Ichigo in head first, intending on swallowing him whole. Unfortunately this didn't work out the best. Ichigo had grown to be the size of his fist and he couldn't fit him totally in his mouth. He tried a few different ways but, even when he did manage to make the spiky haired teen fit in his mouth (by scrunching him up in a ball) he couldn't swallow him whole. He spat him out into his hand and said, \"Well, I wanted to swallow you whole and have you die a slow and painful death inside my stomach, getting slowly dissolved by the acid, but I suppose ripping you limb from limb will have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought the teen up to his mouth and breathed his hot breath onto Ichigo. \"The only question is, which limb first? Maybe your right hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought his teeth over the appendage in question and rested them gently on the wrist. Ichigo started to sweat, a horrible feeling welling up inside him. He was going to die...slowly and horribly, being dismembered by this psychopath. He closed his eyes and whispered softly, \"I'm sorry Lord Jinta. I failed you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez carrot top! Don't give up so easily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ichigo and Grimmjow jerked their heads and saw Jinta standing there, hands on hips, glaring at the Arrancar. Grimmjow brought Ichigo to his mouth and was about to bite off his head when Jinta shouted, \"STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow slowed down but didn't stop entirely. Thinking fast Jinta ripped a hole in reality and stuck his hand through. Just as Grimmjow was about to sever Ichigo's head with his razor sharp teeth Jinta's snatched the boy back, bringing him through the rift and back into his possession. Jinta looked shocked to see how much bigger Ichigo was. Hisagi's mouth was hanging open in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah. What happened to you carrot top?\" Jinta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo was about to explain himself when he remembered what he had had to do. He hesitated, not wanting to disobey his god but not wanting to reveal how he had betrayed him. He bowed and said, \"I'll explain myself in great detail later Lord Jinta. But for now Grimmjow is getting away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta looked up and saw the Arrancar trying to sneak away. \"Oh no you don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta ran forward and slammed his foot down on top of the Arrancar. \"You broke your promise pussy cat! Now get ready to pay the price!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta placed his hands on Grimmjow's back and started siphoning off the slime again. Ichigo suddenly remembered the last time he did this and said, \"Lord Jinta! Some of the slime you're calling up is still active! That's how I grew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta nodded, not breaking his concentration and said, \"Alright then, thanks carrot top!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta drew more and more of the slime out of Grimmjow's system, calling all the particles of it together in a ball, inactive and otherwise. Soon, he had a sizable chunk of slime in his hand. Grimmjow slowly started returning to normal, his massive body deflating smaller and smaller. Jinta set the ball down and grabbed Grimmjow by the collar, lifting him to his feet. \"Now watch kitty! Watch as you shrink before a true god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow watched fearfully as Jinta seemed to expand before his eyes. He could literally feel his strength leaving his body as his muscles returned to their normal size, his body shrinking smaller and smaller. He passed by Jinta's knees...his calves...his ankles...his toes...Grimmjow craned his neck back as the toes grew into mountains before him. Jinta's spiritual pressure pushed down on him, forcing him to remain standing where he was. Jinta waited until Grimmjow was nothing more than a speck before him. He laughed, the sound booming down to Grimmjow like thunder, vibrating inside every fiber of his being. As Jinta reached down to grab him it was like a monolithic god stepping down from on high, the massive fingers gripping the back of his jacket and raising his body off the ground. He rocketed upward until he was face to gigantic eye to Jinta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I take care of you, I have something to attend to.\" Jinta boomed, the wind and volume of his voice blowing Grimmjow backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta picked up the apple sized ball of slime and gobbled it up in three bites. He licked his fingers and belched over Grimmjow. \"I don't know how much of that slime will actually affect me, but now no one else can grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Ichigo and said, \"Now that I think of it, hold still carrot top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo obediently sat still and waited as Ichigo pressed his finger against his chest. Within seconds Jinta had called out all the slime in Ichigo's body, returning the boy to his speck size, and swallowing the small amount of slime like a pill. Ichigo was perfectly content being back to his normal size. He preferred it this way. Jinta then turned his full attention on Grimmjow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...to take care of you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta held the miniscule Arrancar on the tip of his index finger as he looked at him. It was amazing how someone who could give him so much trouble could become less than a bug in a matter of seconds. Then again, he went from being an overworked kid to a god in a few seconds, so it wasn\u2019t completely unbelievable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at yourself, kitten. Where\u2019s your big tough body now? Oh right\u2026it\u2019s <b>GONE</b>!\u201d Jinta yelled, making Grimmjow cover his ears and glad he wasn\u2019t directly in front of the boy\u2019s mouth. His head might have exploded\u2026but maybe that would have been a better death than whatever was in store for him now. He couldn\u2019t believe it had come to this, but it was over. He had tried to open a Garganta to Hueco Mundo while in the void, but Aizen must have sealed the realm from him. Bastard must not have trusted him. It didn\u2019t matter now, because he was done for and there was no way out. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to imagine what\u2019s going through your tiny head right now. Seeing my massive, godly form quickly ascend above you while your own power abandoned you must have been a real kick in nuts. I kinda feel sorry for you. Sorry enough that I can\u2019t bring myself to torture someone as pathetic as you. I\u2019ll end you quickly, okay?\u201d Grimmjow wanted to tell the brat to take his pity and shove it, but held his tongue. Anything he said right now would just amuse the kid, and he wasn\u2019t going to offer him any more amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, though, I want you to get one last look.\u201d Jinta said as he slowly started to move his hand away from his eye. To Grimmjow it felt like the entire world was moving and his view was changing. What was once a gigantic eye surrounded by peach-colored skin became the giant\u2019s handsome face, then his entire head, then his upper chest, until finally Grimmjow could see all of the god\u2019s massive body in all its glory. A body that could have been his, if he hadn\u2019t made some stupid mistakes. \u201cThis is what you tried to overcome.\u201d Jinta grinned evilly and started to crack his neck, shoulders, and arm. If his knuckles cracking sounded like thunder, this must have sounded like a thunder storm. To Grimmjow, it was like death bells. \u201cAnd this is what\u2019s going to destroy you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow felt himself become surrounded in shadow and looked up. The blue sky quickly became like a ceiling of skin as Jinta hovered his thumb over the tiny speck. It got closer and closer, but Grimmjow tried not to look at it and kept his eyes locked with Jinta. He\u2019d glare at the brat until the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been fun, but this is goodbye. Maybe we\u2019ll see each other again. Once I become a complete God, I might resurrect you so I can have some more fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, resurr--\u201d But Grimmjow didn\u2019t finish, because the thumb pressed against the finger and crushed him in a nanosecond. Jinta took great pleasure in rubbing his fingers together, turning the pest into a thin smear that was absorbed into the teen\u2019s pores. The look on Grimmjow\u2019s face in the last moment was priceless. He had given the bug a last glint of hope to snuff out. A nice parting gift for the both of them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s that.\u201d Jinta said, wiping his finger on his shirt despite there being nothing to wipe off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother spectacular victory, Lord Jinta! I never had any doubts!\u201d Hisagi praised, applauding his master. \u201cWhat now, master? Should we celebrate your victory?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time for celebrations. I still have two Soul Reapers and another realm to ruin. Celebrations can wait until after I\u2019m Spirit King.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026Lord Jinta. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, must you also eliminate the two Soul Reapers?\u201d Hisagi asked, an expression of pity on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s just that Grimmjow\u2019s crimes were unforgivable, but they\u2019ve yet to do anything to threaten you. Their intentions may be wrong, but so were ours before we saw the light.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a point\u2026\u201d Jinta replied, scratching his chin. Their crimes weren\u2019t nearly as severe as the Arrancar\u2019s. Plus, he could always use a couple new slaves. He always wanted to turn the moocher into his personal servant, and the kid seemed to have potential too. A little siphoning like he did to Grimmjow and they\u2019d no longer be a threat. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it. It depends on how much trouble they give me. I wouldn\u2019t mind turning them into slaves, but I also wouldn\u2019t mind crushing them between my toes. First we have to find them, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow looked over the ruins of the town and was about to get back to searching when another voice stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a moment, Lord Jinta!\u201d Ichigo yelled up to his god. \u201cI have a request.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, what now? We don\u2019t have all day!\u201d Jinta told the smaller teen, making the boy shrink back in nervousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not too much trouble\u2026could you please punish me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026what? Punish you? What for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor being such a burden to you. I wasn\u2019t paying attention and got caught by Grimmjow. I had to do and say things I\u2019m not proud of. Plus, I exposed myself to things someone like me doesn\u2019t deserve.\u201d Ichigo explained, speaking of his service to Grimmjow and his accidental exposure to the slime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of that was your fault, carrot top. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Lord Jinta! I won\u2019t feel the same unless I pay for what I\u2019ve done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta looked at Ichigo with stern eyes. His slave was ASKING him to punish him. The guy was really devoted. With a sigh, Jinta responded to his slave's plea by saying\u2026</span></div></div>",

I'm nothing more than an unworthy insect who over stepped his boundaries! I don't deserve such kindness that you would give me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta shook his head and said, \"Listen carrot top. What you did was amazing for me. That whole apple thing? Not the smartest plan in the world but I'm not surprised an idiot like that pussy cat fell for it. It gave me all the excuse I needed to not only end his life but make sure you didn't get killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo trembled and said, \"You should have just let me die rather than inconvenience you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta shook his head again. \"Whatever. I was planning on letting you get killed but it would have been a bigger inconvenience having to train a slave to be as devoted as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo bowed and said, \"I do all that I can to please you Lord Jinta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta grinned and said, \"Yeah, and you're great at it carrot top!

Thank you for your mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta just waved his hand and went back to searching. The massive statue that stood in what was once the center of Karakura Town was much smaller than Jinta remembered it, smiling at how much he had grown in the past day. Of course, the statue made it difficult to find where Urahara's Shop once stood. His godly eyes scanned the ground, looking for any hint that would allow him to figure out what part of Karakura Town he was looking at. He growled in frustration looking over at Ichigo. \"Hey carrot top! You know this place pretty well! Where was Urahara's Shop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo squinted down and said, \"I'm sorry Lord Jinta but...I can't see anything from up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta impatiently grabbed Ichigo and deposited him on the ground. Ichigo took a second to catch his breath from the sudden vertiginous trip and got his bearings. Looking around, the entire town had been razed by Jinta. Whatever hadn't been destroyed in his rampage had been pulled into making the statue. There was nothing but a vast plain, with no way of telling this had even BEEN a town in the first place. He looked up and felt his breath catch. He had forgotten how impressive Jinta looked from the ground. He quickly composed himself and said, \"I'm sorry Lord Jinta! There's nothing left! I can't tell where anything used to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta frowned as he scooped Ichigo up into his hand. \"Never mind what I said about rewarding you carrot top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo hung his head and said, \"It's what I deserve Lord Jinta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta was annoyed. He was a god! He should be able to find anyone and anything any time he wanted! These little obstacles in his ascension were starting to get annoying. He stomped the ground in annoyance, causing the statue to wobbled dangerously, fissures radiating out from the the massive foot. Ichigo and Hisagi started conversing, trying to come up with a plan to help their god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this was going on, deep underground, Hitsugaya and Renji were starting to sweat as they heard Jinta stomping around up above. Urahara's underground bunker happened to be hidden by the statue that Jinta had created. Urahara had about ten entrances to it scattered across Karakura Town all connected by tunnels. The only one Jinta would ever have a chance of finding would be the one that was currently covered. The slimes in Renji and Hitsugaya had been fermenting inside them, slowly altering their bodies to prepare them for the transformation from Soul Reaper to God but no transformation was evident in them. They were starting to get worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that stupid brat catches us down here we're screwed!\" Renji shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay calm Renji! Yelling isn't going to help anything.\" Hitsugaya said calmly, a slight facial twitch revealing his nervous state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know what's going to happen if he finds us don't you?\" Renji questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll kill us you idiot.\" Hitsugaya responded, trying to ignore him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell he will!\" Renji shouted. \"He'll do to us what he did to Hisagi and Ichigo! We'll be broken into mindless slaves! I don't know about you, but the last thing I want to do is service that giant KID!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya growled in frustration before turning on Renji. \"You don't think I know all that? What do you propose we do? We are powerless until that slime Urahara gives us starts working. I shudder to think what kind of destruction that boy has already caused while we've been down here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji just growled in frustration and kept pacing. Hitsugaya stared into space, trying to ignore the sounds of thunder above him that he knew were his adversary's footsteps. Would they be able to best this behemoth of a child before it was too late? Only time would tell.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta had enough. If his super sight couldn\u2019t find them, it was time to rely on a different super sense. Jinta began to kneel down and lay himself flat on the ground, pressing his ear up against the dirt. Ichigo and Hisagi were forced to grab hold of Jinta\u2019s cotton shirt to prevent tumbling off. The teen god closed his eyes and listened closely. Nothing could be alive in these ruins, so if he heard anything at all it could only be them. His slaves noticed what Jinta was doing and tried to be as quiet as possible, even holding their breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoth--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, footsteps? Coming from directly beneath him! That must have been them! Jinta opened his eyes and sat up, looking around. His eyes fell on his statue nearby and he begun to think. If the entrance was hidden by the statue\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large boy grinned, got to his feet, and stood over his statue. Blowing on his fist, Jinta spoke, \u201cGuess what, Soul Bugs?\u201d Jinta reared his fist back. \u201cI found ya!!\u201d With that, Jinta smashed his fist into the ground, obliterating it. Fissures shot out from the impact and turned the once smooth ground upside down. Most of all, the statue was turned to dust under Jinta\u2019s knuckles. Ichigo was saddened by the lost of his past reward, but knew someone like him didn\u2019t deserve it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderground, Renji and Hitsugaya shrieked when the enormous fist crashed through the ceiling and brought it down. The shockwave created from the introduction of the huge mass created a wave of destruction that swept over the secret room. The ground tore open and the pillars of stone collapsed. The two Soul Reapers only managed to survive by hopping from one chunk of debris to the next. When it was all over and Jinta removed his fist from the earth, Hitsugaya and Renji was mostly unharmed. They were standing in the middle of a heap of rubble that had once been their hiding place. Looking up in horror, their eyes locked with Jinta\u2019s, who stared down at them from miles above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLong time no see, bugs. Did you miss me?\u201d Jinta asked, chuckling and bringing his hand back into the hole. The two Soul reapers watched the impossibly huge hand descend upon them. It would be foolish to try and escape that. Jinta carefully pinched the two young fighters between his fingers and stood to his full height. Hitsugaya and Renji were brought before Jinta\u2019s godly face, the two almost getting sick from being brought up so high so quickly. \u201cYou boys were a pain to find, but you made the mistake of hiding somewhere I knew about. If I were you, I would have hidden myself somewhere far away\u2026like another country. You might have had a better chance then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? I told you that\u2019s what we should have done!\u201d exclaimed Renji, annoying his superior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think being in a foreign land would be the best thing in this situation. Does it really matter anymore?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe kid\u2019s right; it doesn\u2019t matter. I would have found you eventually. No one is safe from Lord Jinta!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough of your talk, monster!\u201d yelled the white haired captain. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to kill us, just do it already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to kill you. Stomp you under my foot FOR REAL this time. However, why should I dispose of two perfectly good slave candidates so quickly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you! He\u2019s going to turn us into mindless slaves! It\u2019s worst than death!\u201d the vice-captain screamed, shaking with fear. Hitsugaya was ashamed of the older male\u2019s composure. He was shaking so bad it looked like he was going to wet his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 10th Squad Captain looked up at what was supposed to be their \u201cgod\u201d and replied, \u201cYou can forget about me! I\u2019d rather die than become your--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah. Can we just skip the \u2018I\u2019ll never serve you\u2019 dialogue and get straight to the part where I break you anyways?\u201d Jinta said, rolling his humongous eyeballs. \u201cFirst though, I think you two have some slime that needs draining.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta concentrated on the two tiny specks between his fingertips. The two high ranking Soul Reapers closed their eyes and prepared to feel the power leave their bodies. Power that they\u2019d never know. After several seconds, nothing happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrange\u2026\u201d Jinta muttered, stopping his concentration. \u201cYou two are slimeless.\u201d Renji and Hitsugaya looked up at Jinta with puzzled looks. They looked at each other and just shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure, Lord Jinta? Why did the Spirit King lie?\u201d asked Hisagi, grabbing the two other Soul Reapers attention. Did he just say Spirit King? Was the King of Soul Society helping the titan? Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno. At least I got two new slaves out of the wild goose chase. Now\u2026what to do first\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji scooted over to Hitsugaya and whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain, what\u2019s going on? Was the slime Kisuke gave us duds?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. They were supposed to be more potent versions than the stuff Jinta took, right? Perhaps part of that potentness makes their bond with our bodies stronger. We could have no slime on our systems because it\u2019s already completely fused with our beings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tattooed Soul Reaper nodded, hoping the younger boy was right. If he did have an enormous power laying dormant in his body, he wished it would hurry the hell up! It wouldn\u2019t do much good if it activated when he had already succumbed to Jinta\u2019s dominance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I tell you specks you could whisper?!\u201d Jinta boomed, making his two slaves separate immediately and back away from Jinta\u2019s god-like face. \u201cAnyway, time for some good old slave training.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta smirked down at his new slaves, wondering what would be the best place to start breaking them in. There was nothing nearby that he could use to restrain them and put them somewhere on his body. Too bad. He was hoping to make some Soul Reaper rings to round out his living jewelry line. He looked over his body. He could put them in the pockets but that would be far too lenient. He wasn't about to let them just wander around on his shoulders either. This shouldn't be so hard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped his fingers which was the sound of judgment to Renji and Hitsugaya. He grinned down at them and said, \"Alright insects! I've come up with a great idea! You two are going where none of my slaves have gone before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji instinctively glanced downward, fearing that Jinta meant they were going somewhere very...private. Jinta laughed and said, \"Yeah right! Been there done that. You two are going somewhere a lot less fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gathered Renji, Hitsugaya, Ichigo, and Hisagi into his hand and removed his shirt, revealing his sculpted upper body to the world. He flexed a little, loving his older look. He lifted up his arm and smelled his pit. He made a face before smiling. \"Wow, I've worked up a real sweat today. Taking down false gods and looking for little wannabes really works up a sweat. Doesn't help that I haven't bathed in awhile. But it's a perfect environment for two little troublemakers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji moaned and covered his face while Hitsugaya just glared at the teen god. Ichigo and Hisagi smiled at each other and Hisagi said, \"You should have just surrendered to Lord Jinta. It would have been a lot easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the hell up!\" Renji shouted, grabbing Hisagi by the collar. \"I'm not some pathetic little toy to be used by an over sized kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Jinta bellowed from on high. \"I didn't give you permission to touch my slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji instantly let go to cover his ears from the booming voice. Jinta grabbed Renji in his fingers and dangled him in front of his face. \"Listen up you little runt! Kiss your old life goodbye! You're not a Soul Reaper anymore! You don't have any authority! You're less than the dirt I crush under my feet! So GET USED TO IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe punctuated every word with enough force to reduce Renji into a silent, quivering blob of nerves. Jinta nodded at his success and turned his attention to Hitsugaya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you snowball? You got anything to say?\" Jinta asked with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya merely glared up at Jinta and said, \"I have nothing to say to a monster like you. You won't get away with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta snorted in amusement and said, \"Yeah, sure thing snowball. Keep up that bravado. It'll make it all the sweeter when you're begging to kiss my toes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hitsugaya could respond Jinta dumped him on his shoulder along with Ichigo and Hisagi before picking him up and putting him in the same hand as Renji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well specks it's time to head to your new home! Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta laughed as he raised his arm and slowly brought the duo closer and closer to his pit. The closer they got the more they could feel a horrible heat baking off of it, a distinct smell emanating off of it, the stench increasing with every inch. The pit was littered with a small growth of red hairs, each one massive in scale. A single follicle could serve as a living area for the specks, with no fear of falling. Renji started to retch a little at the horrific scent, smelling like thousands of gyms full of thousands of sweaty guys all assaulting his nostrils at once. Hitsugaya could feel sweat dripping down his face and gathering in his clothes. It was like descending into a foul smelling furnace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they were within the confines of the pit. Jinta tipped his palm until the two Soul Reapers were settled on his fingertip. He held them up to the slimy skin and let them see first hand what was in store for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say hello to your new home, and goodbye to your humanity!\" Jinta said with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word Jinta pushed his finger tip into the skin, lightly brushing them off. The sweat instantly adhered them to the skin. Renji was pushed face first into the skin while Hitsugaya was lucky enough to be facing away from the skin. Of course, it was all the same once Jinta lowered his arm. Hitsugaya was forced to watch as the massive arm slowly lowered, hair crinkling into place all around him, the light slowly disappearing, the heat increasing until he was trapped in the foul smelling darkness, his tormentor's muffled laugh the only sound he could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta dusted his hands off and said, \"Well that was easy. That just leaves Hueco Mundo to take care of now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo looked up at his god and said, \"Lord Jinta! If I may ask, how do you plan on taking care of Hueco Mundo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta rolled his eyes and said, \"The same way I took care of the Soul Society carrot top! No one there is even close to my power! It'll be a massacre!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cracked his knuckles and ripped open a portal to Hueco Mundo, stepping through it. This was it. The last obstacle in his path to becoming God. As soon as he was done taking care of Hueco Mundo he would go back to the Spirit King and take over his throne. Jinta frowned as he looked down at his body. It had been awhile since he had grown. What was taking that damn slime so long? He wanted that feeling back, the feeling of his power growing more and more. Technically speaking the Spirit King was still more powerful than he was. That really annoyed him. He didn't want the throne of All Creation to be just handed to him. He wanted to take it! To arrive in front of the Spirit King as a superior being and make him cower before him! He wanted even God to acknowledge him as the most powerful, kneel down before him, and kiss his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta grinned as he imagined this scene. Oh yeah he was going to make it happen. If his body didn't want to grow fast enough for him he could always find another warhead to eat. America had quite a stockpile if he remembered correctly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hueco Mundo, the world of the Hollows, was as silent as it always was. That is, until a rip appeared out of nowhere and a certain teenaged red head stepped through to make some noise. Under one of his large, strong arms were his two newest slaves; slowly cooking in the intense heat Jinta\u2019s body radiated. Under the other was his damp, sweaty shirt which he hadn\u2019t bothered to put back on. If he had put it on, all the heat his body gave off would have been trapped in its folds and eventually cooked his slaves to death. Plus, he wanted to show Hueco Mundo just what they were up against. He had never been to Hueco Mundo before, obviously, but he was hoping for something similar to Soul Society. Some Hollow villages, maybe a few large towers. Something that could be called Aizen\u2019s kingdom. Needless to say, he was disappointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>This</i> is Hueco Mundo?\u201d inquired Jinta, looking over the desert-like world and wiggling his toes through the white sand. \u201cNo wonder Aizen wants to rule the world. I\u2019d be unhappy too if I ruled a wasteland.\u201d Jinta scanned the horizon and looked for any structures. Save for a few half-buried buildings, the only thing he could see was a large fortress in the distance: Las Noches. He had to say, the Hollow realm was quite big. Despite his own impressive size, the castle was a ways off. It would take at least a minute to get there if he ran. Jinta wasn\u2019t in any rush, though, and started walking forward. He wanted the Arrancars to hear his approach and watch helplessly as his gargantuan form got closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world under Jinta\u2019s soles wasn\u2019t lifeless, though. As Jinta marched through the sands, the Hollows that made there home in Hueco Mundo began to become aware of his presence. However, these were weak and mindless Hollows. They didn\u2019t understand just how powerful and mighty Jinta was, just that he was a massive source of spiritual energy that they wanted to devour. Before Jinta knew it, thousands of Hollows emerged from the sand and started to surround him. Several more thousand Hollows took flight and flew at Jinta\u2019s massive form. They attached themselves to his torso and attempted to cause the boy harm. Biting, scratching, slashing, and punching they tried; but nothing seemed to break through the behemoth\u2019s hard muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPests.\u201d grumbled Jinta as he brushed the specks off himself. He was about to continue his trek when he noticed something heavy on his feet. Looking down, he saw that thousands of Hollows had covered his bare feet like swarms of insects. \u201cUgh, what do you bugs think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d Jinta lifted his feet out of the Hollow crowd and stomped them out of existence. He turned his attention to another flock of flying Hollows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want all this delicious spirit energy?\u201d Jinta asked, patting himself on the chest. \u201cWell you can\u2019t have it, but you can become part of it!\u201d Jinta opened his mouth and took a long breath, filling not only his lungs with air but his mouth with Hollows. No Hollow could escape the unimaginable force of the vacuum and were sucked up. Once all the airborne creatures were in his wet cave, Jinta closed his lips and swallowed them all in one gulp. He felt them drop into his stomach where they were easily overcome by his inner juices. Some Hollows continued to fight from the inside, but were quickly melted by the acids. Rubbing his abs, Jinta felt his stomach rumble under his hand and hot air rose up from it toward his mouth. Jinta bent down so his face was directly above the grounded Hollows and unleashed a huge belch. The force of the sound wave alone crushed any remaining Hollows and burrowed a crater into the sand. Jinta wiped his mouth with his arm and smirked evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the meal. Got anymore?\u201d Jinta looked around, but found that any surviving Hollows were intelligent enough to flee. He shrugged and continued on to Las Noches. As he approached, the fortress\u2019s leader watched him. Aizen\u2019s eyes showed no fear, only amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile your senses are that of a god\u2019s, they are still senses. You are not immune to my power.\u201d Aizen said as he began to unsheathe his katana. \u201cShatter, Kyoka Suigetsu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta\u2019s walk to Las Noches was taking too long so he decided to pick up the pace. He started to run, feeling the expansive realm pass by him. He covered miles in seconds while any Hollows or structures that happened to be in his path were swept up in the destruction he was causing. Eventually, he reached the palace and towered over it. A frown spread over his lips. The castle may have been impressive to anyone else, but to Jinta it was puny. A little bigger than Seireitei, but still nothing compared to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came all this way to destroy this? What a waste\u2026let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d Jinta stepped over the fortress so both his legs were positioned on either side of it. Grinning down at the sizable structure, Jinta let himself sit down on the palace. It quickly broke under his massive weight and collapsed. The dome was hollow on the inside, so not much was offered in terms of resistance. Jinta felt his butt crush the entire building and everything inside of it. Soon nothing was left standing and Jinta rubbed his ass into the rubble a few times before getting up and dusting his pants off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was simple. Now to find a way to make myse--\u201d Jinta was interrupted by something that caught his eye. Not far from his current position was ANOTHER fortress, this one identical to the one he had just obliterated. Why hadn\u2019t he noticed it before? \u201cTwo castles? Who builds to castles right next to each other?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta just shrugged and strolled over to the second fortress. He sat down again, but not on the structure this time. Instead he sat just before it with his back facing the building. He sighed and leaned himself back upon the building. Like before, the fortress creaked under his weight until its few supports were broken and it fell under his body. Jinta smiled as he crushed the second castle under his muscular back. Ichigo and Hisagi were lucky not to roll of the boy\u2019s shoulder. They couldn\u2019t grab onto his hard skin, but they remained in place by the layer of sweat decorating his broad shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, NOW we\u2019re leaving.\u201d Jinta announced, sitting up and preparing to get to his feet until yet another thing was caught in in his sight. Yep, you guessed it, a third Las Noches. Jinta\u2019s face turned red with anger as he hurried to his feet and stomped over to the building. Without bothering to think of a creative way to crush this one, Jinta simply kicked the structure to bits. It took just a few swings of his feet until nothing remained but smoking ruins. Jinta stopped to catch his breath and wiped his brow of sweat. Hitsugaya and Renji must feel like they\u2019re in a volcano. After getting his energy back, Jinta smiled down at the ruins beneath him. How easily it was to do what no one else could before him: defeat Aizen and his goons. He wasn\u2019t doing anyone a favor, though. They just happened to be plotting against him. Jinta turned back to the other ruined palaces to take in their destruction as well. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJinta\u2019s mouth gaped open in shock. They were both standing again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizen smirked at Jinta\u2019s little display of power from the real Las Noches, hidden from Jinta. He had cast his Zanpakuto\u2019s Shikai on him and trapped him in his illusion. Jinta\u2019s superior senses only served to make the illusions seem all the more real. He didn\u2019t expect this to stop Jinta in the end, however. He was only stalling for time until his 8th Espada finished their ultimate project. He planned to have as much fun with Jinta as he could, and that wasn\u2019t just limited to confusing the boy a bit. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta was getting seriously pissed. No matter what he did, Las Noches seemed to pop up out of nowhere. But that was impossible! Castles didn't just pop up out of nowhere. After stomping out his tenth castle he stopped to catch his breath. He leaned down, hands on his knees and just panted. This was insane! Someone was making him a fool of him and he wasn't going to let him get away with it. Ichigo, who was pressed face down on top of Jinta's shoulder, would have been able to tell Lord Jinta that what he was seeing was nothing more than illusion. Hisagi, who was plastered on his back, with his head pointing sideways, was in the same boat as Jinta, thinking the fortresses were real and trying to figure out how they were rising up out of the ground. When Jinta was done resting he saw that six fortresses were surrounding him. He crossed his arms and said, \"There is no way this is happening! These fortresses have to be a mirage or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizen smiled at the teen's revelation and said, \"Alright then, let's try something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta smirked when he saw the fortresses disappear. \"Hah! I knew it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around for the real fortress but there didn't appear to be one. He was about to start heading off in a random direction to find the fortress when he saw something strange out of the corner of his eye. He turned to look and saw what appeared to be a crowd of specks rushing toward him. He focused on them and was shocked to see it was thousands of Soul Reapers! But that was impossible! He stepped forward and brought his foot down on them with a deafening crash. This merely caused them to start swarming up and over his foot, rushing up his legs. He could feel their tiny blades trying to attack him and failing miserably. He used his other foot to scrape them off, sending many of them tumbling down to the ground while others merely swarmed onto the other leg. It was like being attacked by a bunch of insects.Soon, they were running up his torso. Jinta slapped them and rubbed them into his giant body, their presence becoming more and more annoying. Finally he just shouted in frustration and fell onto his back, turning back and forth until all the bugs were crushed underneath him. When he got back up he saw that the Soul Reapers had all vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now what the heck is going on here?!?\" Jinta roared in frustration, looking around as if hoping to spot the source of his agitation. Aizen, however wasn't about to let Jinta find the real Las Noches. If his concentration faltered on keeping the fortress hidden Jinta would destroy it in an instant. But Aizen wasn't one to lose his cool so easily. He merely cast yet another illusion over the teen god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta's question was left unanswered as he was suddenly hit from behind. He was thrown forward onto his stomach. He turned around and felt his jaw drop. He hadn't seen anything like this coming. Standing before him with a sadistic grin and cracking his knuckles was Grimmjow. Jinta jumped up and saw that the fallen god was the same size as him. He shook his head but Grimmjow was still standing there. There was just no way! This was impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I killed you less than 15 minutes ago!\" he shouted. \"How the hell are you even here?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow didn't bother answering. He merely charged forward slammed a fist in Jinta's gut, sending the boy to the ground once more. Jinta kicked out and managed to knock Grimmjow down onto one knee, jumping up and kicking him in the face. Jinta ran over and stomped on his stomach, knocking the wind out of him before kicking him in the face again. Jinta panted a little and watched as Grimmjow got up. Jinta had seen that he had clearly did some damage. A bruise on his stomach, a deep scratch along his face, things like that. However, when Grimmjow faced him again there wasn't a single sign of any damage whatsoever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizen knew he couldn't keep this up forever. Las Noches was hidden from view but if Jinta were to stumble over to it he could accidentally crush it without realizing it. Just having him running and jumping around was causing massive damage to the area, breaking apart the ground, opening fissures, and creating earthquakes that raged up and down the countryside. If Aporro didn't hurry up and finish his experiment they might not last...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aizen watched Jinta\u2019s little skirmish with the fake Grimmjow from the comfort of his throne. The boy was beginning to suspect something, but that hardly mattered. Knowing it was illusion or not, Jinta was still trapped in it. A holographic screen displaying Szayel\u2019s face popped up in front of the former captain, a wicked grin plastered to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything is ready, Lord Aizen.\u201d the pink haired Espada announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, then let us end this charade.\u201d replied Aizen, equally as enthusiastic as Aporro but not showing a hint of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Jinta recoiled from another blow of Grimmjow\u2019s. He was covered in bruises and cuts and short on breath, but wasn\u2019t planning on giving in to the ghost. Just before he threw himself at the older giant, Grimmjow shattered into millions of glass shards that vanished before they hit the ground. Jinta was confused once again, and even more so when he noticed all his injuries were gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, what\u2019s going on here?! I\u2019m sick of this game! Carrot top, do you know what\u2019s going on?\u201d Jinta asked his head slave, but noticed when he looked down that both the smaller teens were laying down on his shoulder unable to move. \u201cOops, guess my body\u2019s a lot more sweatier than I thought.\u201d Jinta gently peeled the two shrimpy teens free. He then lifted his arm and checked on his two slaves-in-training. \u201cYou two still alive?\u201d Jinta got a few groans as a response and plucked them free, holding all four of his slaves free. He picked up his shirt which had dropped during the fight, fanned it in the air to remove any sand, and slipped it back over his torso. He turned his attention back to Renji and Toshiro, who were still really weak from their hot stay in his pit. \u201cYour training is far from finished, but I don\u2019t want to torture my good slaves in the process. We\u2019ll continue after we finish up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sweaty Soul Reapers didn\u2019t respond, being too weak. Jinta deposited all four of them on his shoulder. Ichigo, now able to speak, yelled up to his master, \u201cLord Jinta! I think we\u2019re in an illusion!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIllusion? That would explain a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s Aizen\u2019s Zanpakuto. It has the power to control anyone\u2019s senses. This is my first time seeing it, but I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but the real castle is still there, right? I just can\u2019t see it. In that case, I\u2019ll just kick this place apart until I feel it crumble!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jinta could put his plan into action, he felt the ground start to rumble. It rumbled so much that even the mighty titan himself was thrown off balance. Four hidden, gigantic hatches opened nearby. They were each large enough for Jinta to fit through, and each seemed like a hole to infinite darkness. The sound of machines starting to crank echoed across Hueco Mundo as four giant capsules started to emerge from the pits. These capsules were far from normal, being covered in what looked like skin instead of metal and sporting many eyes. It was proof that these objects were probably grown, not constructed. No one would be able to construct something so massive in so little time, let alone four of them. Jinta was both amazed and angered that something actually existed that was equal in size to him. Once the capsules had fully emerged, he proceeded to stomp over to them so he could trash them\u2026whatever \u201cthem\u201d was. He barely got half-way there when the capsules started to open, and he stopped dead. Steam spread from the capsules and washed over Hueco Mundo like a thick fog. That wasn\u2019t all that poured out, though. Jinta, his slaves, Aizen, everyone in Hueco Mundo felt a massive spiritual energy flood out of each capsule as they opened. Each one must have been given off spiritual pressure equal to Jinta\u2019s, who was rooted in place. His slaves were once again laying flat on the boy\u2019s shoulder, and not because of the sweat this time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain!\u201d yelled Renji, lucky enough to have his face facing sideways so he could speak. \u201cWhat is this?! This spiritual energy\u2026it\u2019s identical to the kid\u2019s, but there\u2019s four of them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAizen!\u201d Hitsugaya muttered his name with spite. \u201cWhat have you done this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizen smiled, his victory all but assured. The capsules fully opened and the figures of giants started to emerge. They were all just as big as Jinta and dressed in the same garb as an Arrancar . And their faces\u2026were that of a white-haired Jinta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh for crying out loud!\u201d Jinta screamed, ears steaming. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough with look-a-likes! Can\u2019t anyone be original?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look-a-likes didn\u2019t seem to notice Jinta. They were too busy examining their bodies, grinning with delight at what they saw. They appeared to be Arrancars, each possessing the mask fragment of an upper jaw positioned in such a way so it covered their left eyes. Other than that and their hair and clothes, they were perfect copies. Same face, same build, same grin. If they had Hollow holes, they weren\u2019t visible. Eventually Jinta\u2019s yelling got their attention and they looked his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you? You\u2019re not us, since your hair\u2019s red.\u201d one of them spoke, his voice exactly like Jinta\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe must be the guy we were created from.\u201d answered another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCreated from? What the hell are you talking about?\u201d Jinta asked, scratching his hair. Hitsugaya and Renji looked at the four Arrancars with disbelief. One Jinta was enough\u2026now there were four more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re clones, in a sense.\u201d spoke Aporro, who increased the volume of his voice via a microphone so everyone could hear him. The scientist appeared next to one of the bare feet of his creations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExplain, Pinky. Now.\u201d Jinta commanded, already disliking the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour ability to come up with pet names at first glance is astounding.\u201d Aporro said, curling a strand of hair with his finger. \u201cThey are clones I created using the DNA you so generously left behind during the last few days. At your size, even a droplet of blood is easy to find. Plus, that little stunt you pulled to wipe out the Soul Reapers helped out quite a bit.\u201d Szayel licked his lips at the last part, displaying his creepy side. \u201cI call them the Infinity Corps. They have your size and all your abilities, plus your average Arrancar\u2018s abilities such as Cero. Unfortunately, they also posses your personality, but they\u2019ll kill you and the Spirit King all the same. Infinity Corps, eliminate this menace immediately!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arrancar Jintas didn\u2019t move a muscle. They acted like they didn\u2019t know Aporro existed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for? I told you to eliminate him!\u201d Aporro ordered up at the far larger Arrancars. The Arrancar who owned the foot Szayel stood next to looked down at him with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, look boys. It\u2019s a tiny speck.\u201d he said, bringing the others\u2019 attention towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. I wonder why it thought it could stand among gods like us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should teach it a lesson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-what?!\u201d Aporro mumbled, his legs becoming weak as he watched one of his creations lift his bare sole over him. \u201cYou can\u2019t disobey me! I created you!! I control--\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*STOMP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white-haired Jinta swiveled his foot a bit before erupting into a fit of laughter with his brothers. Jinta felt like laughing too, if these four weren\u2019t his enemies. Inside Las Noches, Aizen simply smirked while others looked on in confusion. During the production of the Infinity Corps, he had tricked Aporro into making them obey no one but himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy children,\u201d Aizen spoke to the four teenaged-looking Arrancars. Special chips had been planted in their heads, allowing them to hear Aizen\u2019s commands from anywhere. \u201cPlease eliminate this so-called-god.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger.\u201d they all said as they cracked their knuckles, giving Jinta wicked grins. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta bent down slightly, raising his fists in a fighting stance, and waited for the impostors to make the first move. They were all slowly spreading out, circling him around. He was aware of each one of them, even the two behind him. These clones were made with his personality and he knew just how creative and destructive he could get. He was standing in the fighting stance to hid the fact that he was gripping reality, ready to rip it open and escape or trap these clones away until he could decide how to deal with them. Suddenly, the one to the right of him said, \"Hey, we don't want to fight you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta turned to him and said, \"Yeah right! You wannabes were made from me so I know how you think! I'm not going to let anyone stand in my way of becoming god so there's no reason you four shouldn't feel the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one to the left said, \"Actually, we're being suppressed by a chip in our head.\" He tapped his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one behind him said, \"So we really can't do anything that he doesn't want us to do\" He pointed to an empty area. Jinta figured he was pointing at the real Las Noches. He wanted to mark the area in some way so he'd be able to find it later but couldn't think of a way. He turned to the guy in front of him who said, \"So we do have to kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one to the right: \"And we will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight: \"But that doesn't mean we can't have some fun first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFront: \"Besides, we could kill you in a second anyway. Totally crushing you is fun...but humiliating you first is even better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta glared at them and shouted, \"Like I'd ever let you nobodies take me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Infinity Corp all laughed at him and the one to the right said, \"Look at you! You're pathetic! You're all bruised and beaten! We could take you out in five seconds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta jeered and said, \"I'd like to see you try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew what was happening he felt hands and feet slamming into him from all directions. These guys were fast! Was he always this fast when he was at 100%? He was suddenly face first in the warm sand, his arms pinned behind him while his legs were being held down by two hands for each leg. He struggled and tried to free himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd stop if I were you original.\" The one holding his arms said with a snicker. \"I've got my hand right next to your neck. If you make any more sudden moves say \"bye-bye\" to your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta stopped and shouted, \"What, you think this is enough to stop me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one holding his right leg said, \"Don't kid yourself. You're too tired to knock us off and your hands are tied up so you can't rip open reality. You're helpless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" a voice said from above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta looked up and saw the last of his clones smirking down at him, hands at his hips. \"Our slime was improved, integrated with our cells. Yours however...\"He just grinned evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, we're giving you a great deal.\" The one on the right leg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, nothing's stopping us from stealing all your slime right now and crushing you like a bug.\" The one on his other leg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're giving you a chance to live for a little longer, so I suggest you take it!\" The one holding his arms said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta gritted his teeth and stared at the ground. The best thing he could see from his angle was the bare feet of the clone standing in front of him. The last thing he wanted to do was imagine himself small enough to be crushed by those feet. He wasn't some stupid bug! He was a god! He was going to smash these wannabes, and obliterate the idiots who thought they could stand up to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Lord Jinta! These pretenders are nothing compared to you!\" Hisagi shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right! Rise up and smash them Lord Jinta!\" Ichigo shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are these? Specks?\" The one standing above Jinta grabbed all four of his slaves into his palm and looked at them with an evil grin. \"Hah! Nice, you have some little slaves! Hey, there's four of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one holding his arms shouted, \"Awesome! One for each of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. Jinta saw red. He twisted savagely, catching his opponents off guard and freeing his arms which allowed him to get enough leverage to free his legs. He got to his feet and tackled the clone holding his slaves, pinning him down. He raised his hand and was about to sever the clone's head when one grabbed him from behind, forcing his arms up and pulling him off the other clone. The one who had been tackled got to his feet and slammed his fist in Jinta's gut. \"Consider this a warning.\" He slammed it in again. \"If you try anything like that again...\" Again. \"We'll finish you off for good!\" The last punch was aimed at his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what's it going to be?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta\u2019s answer was easy. So easy, in fact, he spat it in his face. The Arrancar didn\u2019t change is facial expression and just wiped the saliva off with his sleeve. He gave his original a good kick in the gut afterwards, making Jinta spit out blood next. While he was recovering from the blow, the two other Arrancars grabbed his shoulders and forced him to his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSubmit to us or not, we\u2019ll still have our fun.\u201d the clone in front of him said as he pocketed the four tiny Soul Reapers somewhere in his white jacket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to distribute those amongst ourselves?\u201d the one holding Jinta\u2019s left shoulder asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will, but first let\u2019s have some fun with this so-called-god.\u201d the front clone replied, cracking the fingers of his right hand as he looked down at Jinta. The one-eyed clone crouched down and grabbed Jinta\u2019s hair with that hand, forcing the technically older male to look at him. \u201cReady, guys? Do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta\u2019s eyes widened as he realized what they were about to do. He started to thrash, desperately trying to escape their hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d he shouted, but it was too late. It had begun. All four of his clones were in physical contact with him, and through that contact they began to draw out the slime within Jinta. The red head felt his power, his godhood, leaving him from four different points. Slowly the slime began to seep out of his pores, just as he had done to Grimmjow only minutes before. It gathered into the Infinity Corps\u2019 hands, each one of them grinning down at Jinta sadistically. Jinta wasn\u2019t in physical pain, but they knew he was hurting. When they had finished, each one of them let go of the boy and held a golf ball of the powerful slime in their palms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we eat them now?\u201d One of them asked, inspecting the orb between his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the point.\u201d the front one answered. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to grow any bigger than we already are to humiliate this guy. He\u2019s about to shrink, after all.\u201d The frontal clone looked Jinta in the eyes and grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, original. We didn\u2019t take all of it, just enough to cut you down to size. And look, it\u2019s starting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta watched as the face that almost seemed like a reflection of his started to get further and further away. The four clones who surrounded him pocketed his prized slime for later use and watched as the mighty Jinta shrunk before their eyes. Jinta got to his feet and noticed he was looking directly into one of the clone\u2019s chest. He continued to lose his size and became leveled with the doppelgangers\u2019 waists. He looked at his hands in horror and disbelief. He didn\u2019t seem to be losing his older body, but that hardly seemed important when what really mattered was going out the window. This couldn\u2019t be happening, not after he had done so much. He had struck fear into an entire planet, destroyed the protectors of said planet, and crushed anyone who got in his way. In the end, he was to be beaten by himself?! He knew the saying \u201cYou are your own greatest enemy\u201d, but no one said anything about there being four yous! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta felt himself stopped shrinking and looked up. He was horrified to see that he stood just up to the Arrancar\u2019s knees. It wasn\u2019t even half his former size! The four look-a-likes chuckled down at him with their arms folded over their chests. Jinta felt like a little kid about to be bullied by a bunch of teenagers. This wasn\u2019t how a god was supposed to feel. He clenched his fists in anger and craned his head up at the front clone, giving him a death glare. He prepared to tear reality, separating the white-haired Jinta\u2019s body from his grinning head. Before he could, the Arrancar acted first and pointed his palm at the smaller boy. Jinta felt his hand hit something solid. He tried punching the air, but hit a hard surface instead. Feeling around with his hands, he realized he was trapped in an orb of warped space\u2026and it was shrinking! The sphere got smaller and smaller by the Arrancar\u2019s command. Jinta tried bashing out of the orb and even increasing his spiritual pressure, but the walls wouldn\u2019t give. Eventually he was forced into a fetal position, hugging his legs and burrowing his face into his chest. He heard the superior gods mock him above, giggling and making comments. One of them picked up the orb and brought it to his face, peering at its contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, look guys, a soccer ball. All ready to be kicked around.\u201d the Jinta clone mocked, grinning at the red-headed teen. Jinta tried to shout curses and threats at his captor, but the sphere was made to allow sound in\u2026but none could get out. The Arrancar dropped the \u201cball\u201d and started to pelt it against his knee, hitting it into the air several times. Jinta felt every impact like he was being kneed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver here!\u201d the second clone shouted, running backwards away from the first clone. The Arrancar let the sphere drop to the ground and kicked it with all his strength, sending Jinta hurtling toward the other white head. This one puffed out his chest and stopped the ball with it, bouncing it a few times before letting it fall to his feet so he could run with it. He dashed across the desert of Hueco Mundo, uncaring of any minor Hollows that were in his way and were smashed as a result. He dribbled Jinta for a bit until one of his brothers ran up beside him. The third clone signaled him to pass him the ball, and he did. With Jinta now at the mercy of his third clone, he felt himself first get shot up to the teen\u2019s chest, which then smacked him past the boy\u2019s head. With Jinta over his head, the clone proceeded to keep him there by bouncing him on his head. After the fifth bounce, he did a backwards flip and kicked their plaything with his heel. Jinta went spiraling into the ground, creating a sizable crater when he hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last clone wasted no time and strolled over to Jinta, placing his bare foot on the fallen god. Jinta felt the pressure on him increase, groaning in pain. He felt humiliated and he hated it. This is how his slaves must have felt, and it was only right they felt like this. It was their duties to be slaves, as it was his to be a god ruling over them. The clone above him removed his foot and picked Jinta up. He balanced the sphere on his finger and let it spin. Jinta felt his entire world rotate at an unimaginable speed as he face started to become pale. When the ball stopped spinning, it was moments before he could have puked over himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was fun.\u201d the clone said as he dug his nails into the sphere, popping it and releasing the mini-god inside. His fingers were wrapped around Jinta\u2019s waist and he held the boy like a stuffed doll. The others came over and also looked down at Jinta, grins decorating their faces. The one holding him started to look closely at him and said, \u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t notice it when we were tossing him around, but our original\u2019s kind of cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course he his, dumbass, he\u2019s us. And we are pretty hot.\u201d The clone that said this started to flex a little. Their egos were just as big as Jinta\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but I wish we had red hair.\u201d the Arrancar said while running his fingers through Jinta\u2019s crimson head of hair. \u201cWhat was Pinky thinking when he gave us white hair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you stop touching me!\u201d Jinta shouted up at his clone, earning him a smirk in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean like this.\u201d The clone ran his finger down Jinta\u2019s face, brushing past his lips, to the teen\u2019s chest. Jinta used his small hands to push the finger away, which surprisingly worked. \u201cOh, still full of energy? That\u2019s good, you\u2019ll need it.\u201d The clone grinned evilly, knowing his brothers were thinking the same thing as he. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the specks? I want to toy around with them a little.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat good are a few measly specks, other than for crushing?\u201d asked another clone. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t even make good snacks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur original carried them with him, so he must have thought up ways to play with them. I can already think up a few ideas\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll sorts of ideas buzzed around in the group\u2019s minds. They could have a lot of fun with those specks, especially since some of them seemed to be loyal to Jinta. What was the difference between him and them? Then again, the idea of getting\u2026intimate with their cute plaything also had its appeal. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Screw the specks!\" The one holding Jinta said. \"We don't have any orders about them, so we'll have plenty of time to play with them later. We have to kill the original so let's use him while we can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others agreed to this and rounded on Jinta. Before the smaller teen knew what was happening he was surrounded by hands and fingers, stroking, poking, prodding, and touching him. He squirmed hating the feelings of helplessness that were running through him. He was bruised, battered, beaten, and covered in his own vomit. He was truly completely at his clones mercy. They all laughed at him and one said, \"Alright then let's get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta's heart started racing as he heard this. Another of the clones roughly grabbed his shirt and said, \"Let's get rid of this thing! It's covered in puke and he's not going to need it anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone pulled the shirt off roughly, tossing it aside and revealing Jinta's heaving and slightly muscular chest. It was covered in scratches and bruises and looked painful to behold. The clone merely snickered and poked the bruises. \"This is a god's body? Yeah right! What a load of crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta groaned a little at the pain that shot through his body at every poke but refused to scream out for these impostors. Another clone walked up and said, \"These pants have got to go too!\" He unbuttoned and unzipped his blue shorts and pulled them off, throwing them in the same place as the shirt. Jinta was now left only in a pair of loose fitting boxers, his body shivering slightly in the cold grips of his assailants. Yet another clone walked forward and smirked at Jinta, running his hands up and down his chest, lingering over his nipples. \"You have really soft skin original...\" He licked one of his nipples gently and said, \"You don't taste bad either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fist clone shoved the other one out of the way and said, \"Don't hog him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta winced as he felt the clone lick his tiny foot, the hot wet muscle digging between his toes. \"This is the kind of thing you forced our slaves to do to you right? Aren't you enjoying it now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he wasn't. This feeling wasn't the same. Before it was because he was dominating someone, forcing them to do something against his way. That's where half the pleasure came from. But this...with this he knew that he was being dominated and that was an ugly feeling. As a god, he was supposed to be suppressing others, not the other way around. This felt unnatural, even if it was being done essentially by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second clone came back up and said, \"Don't let him have all the fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed Jinta roughly in his hands and said, \"All that soccer playing made my feet dirty little original. Why don't you lick them clean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta kicked the clone in the face as his answer. The clone just grinned and said, \"Have it your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw Jinta hard onto the ground and slammed his foot on the back of his head. \"Hey,. someone grab his arms*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arrancar that had been holding Jinta previously grabbed Jinta's arms and forced them behind his back before lifting his head up. Jinta spat out a little blood and looked up at the clone in front of him. Before he could do anything he saw a foot slammed into his face. \"Now...LICK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta stuck his tongue out and brought it up the clone's foot, tasting sweat and dirt, knowing now what he had forced others to do for him. His heart sank when he realized exactly what was happening. He was being broken. This was no different from his own slaves' training. He shook his head and his eyes regained their resolve. No matter what they forced him to do, he wouldn't give in. He savagely licked the foot until the clone pulled it away and said, \"Not bad original. For a \"god\" you make a good slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Give him to us!\" Two clones called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta looked over and saw the two stripped to their underwear. They each grabbed him and forced him to the ground. They began to kiss and lick his body all over, making him squirm in pleasure at the feeling, pain as they roughly handled his bruised body, and shame as he was treated like a slave.Suddenly, he felt his boxers get torn off, revealing his privates to the world. \"Aww, look at this little dick. How cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clones all laughed at the mocking tone and the relatively small genitals on Jinta. He blushed in embarrassment and anger as the clones stripped around him, surrounding him. One locked lips with him, his big tongue filling the teen's mouth. Two more each took one of his nipples, sucking them, their tongues running all over his chest and stomach. The last one took his dick, sucking hard, his tongue juggling his small balls. Jinta could only moan and twist in pleasure, his mind rebelling against this pure pleasure. Eventually the three that weren't servicing his crotch  got on their knees and started jerking off to the scene, their hormones running wild. Within minutes Jinta was cumming inside of his clone's mouth while the three masturbating released their seed all over Jinta's body, staining his face, hair, chest, and stomach with their hot seed. Jinta just laid in the sand, breathing heavily, eyes closed tight. Before he could recover he felt his body get turned over. \"Hey, I didn't get any release! Now hold still!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta gritted his teeth as he felt something huge slam into his backside, ripping him open, blood pouring out. He groaned a little as the cock forced it's way in and out of him, his body dripping sweat and cum from the other clones. The clone pounding Jinta's ass cared nothing for the pain he was causing him, wanting only to get his own pleasure. The other clones laughed and taunted Jinta as they witnessed this event. It was the ultimate humiliation. Soon enough, the clone came explosively inside Jinta, the white liquid spurting out the sides and running down Jinta's legs. The clone removed himself and got to his feet, kicking Jinta to the ground where he lay, broken, beaten, and defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's play with those specks now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, original over there's not going anywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought he'd hold up for longer! Killing him's not going to be any fun at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget him! Let's concentrate on the specks for now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta heard these voices but couldn't bring himself to get up. He was too hurt to move. His butt felt like it was on fire, his body was covered in more bruises than he could count, he was sure some of his bones were broken, and his spirit was broken. He hated this, hated it with every fiber of his being! It wasn't supposed to be like this! He was a god! He was meant to control the universe, to bend it and everyone in it to his will! And he would dammit! He looked over at his clones as they fished his slaves out of one of the clone's pockets. It was taking them awhile since all their clothes were identical. He tried to lift himself up and felt a screaming pain tear across his body. He slumped back down on the sand. He had to come up with a plan...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the four cruel Arrancar had had their way with Jinta, they immediately set their sights on his slaves. They rustled through their jackets until one of them shouted, \u201cFound them!\u201d as he peered into the inner pocket and scooped out the four specks. \u201cThese outfits have too many pockets\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone opened his palm, revealing the four scared little slaves. The former Soul Reapers looked around as the smirking foursome surrounded them and stared them down. They were all naked and reeked of sex; what the hell had they been doing? Before one of them could ask, the clones started to pick them out of the palm one by one. They chose their slaves randomly, not really caring which one they took as long as they could have fun with them. Only Renji was left, alone in the sweaty palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I get stuck with the moocher.\u201d the clone who had found the slaves said as he took his hand away from his comrades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, I got carrot top.\u201d another announced as he brought the orange haired teen to his visible eyeball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis kid looks even younger than us. Will he make a good slave?\u201d a third clone asked, inspecting Hitsugaya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got stuck with the boring one. Just my luck.\u201d The clone who held Hisagi muttered. The four clones, their own slaves in hand, began to separate to spend some quality time with their personal specks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do with Lord Jinta?!\u201d Ichigo shouted at the white-haired imposter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are talking about, carrot top?\u201d the clone asked innocently. \u201cI am Lord Jinta. Don\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d Ichigo tried to say something but nothing came out. These were obviously Arrancar, but they were so much like his Lord Jinta. If he was blind he would never have known the difference. \u201cI guess you need to be taught that again, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ichigo knew what was happened, the clone had moved the fingers that were pinching him down to his soft dick. With just one digit, he unstuck the loyal slave onto the pinkish head where he became glued in place by sweat and cum. Ichigo tried to struggle, but found himself completely trapped. The familiar musk in the air started to calm him and he caught himself beginning to relax. He would not be fooled, though, and continued his struggles. The Arrancar watched the tiny little dot wiggle on his cock head. The feeling of having all this power over someone so weak started to fill his cock with blood one again, making him erect. He gently stroked himself, not enough to bring on an orgasm but enough to give him more pleasure. Ichigo felt the \u201cfloor\u201d under him start to heat up as he sweated profoundly. It was like being in an oven\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi\u2019s head was a train wreck. He had worked so hard to submit himself to Jinta that he found himself unable to think of this Arrancar as anything but Jinta. These clones looked, spoke, and acted just like Lord Jinta did. Even their spiritual pressure, which should have stunk like an Arrancar\u2019s, was a perfect copy of Jinta\u2019s. He tried to keep telling himself this imposter wasn\u2019t his god, but then he spoke\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, 69 face, are you going to shout up at me that I\u2019m not Lord Jinta?\u201d the Infinity Corps clone asked, placing Hisagi on his warm and damp palm. The former vice-captain couldn\u2019t say anything. He stuttered a bit, but nothing came out. How could he tell the giant he wasn\u2019t Lord Jinta when everything about him was! \u201cWell\u2026I guess you aren\u2019t. That\u2019s good.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white haired teen sat down and rested his back against the warm sands of Hueco Mundo. He tilted his hand over and dropped Hisagi on his left pectoral. Hisagi trembled under pink hill that was the god\u2019s nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little guy like you would spend an eternity trying to worship all of me, so I\u2019m just going to let you worship my nipple. That sound good? Go ahead and do what you want with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi couldn\u2019t control his body. It lurched forward as if pulled by magnetism and climbed up the pink bump. After scaling it, he laid himself on his stomach and hugged as much of the hard flesh as possible. He lost control of his tongue next, which lapped up as much sweat as the nipple had to offer, and that was a lot. The clone just stared down at his slave with amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, kid, what do you want to do? Lick my toes? Kiss my abs? Maybe clean my teeth?\u201d the Arrancar gave the Soul Reaper captain a big smile, showing off his pearly whites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI refused to be the slave of Jinta, what makes you think I\u2019d offer you any services?\u201d the white haired prodigy replied, glaring at the clones just as he glared at Jinta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA disobedient slave, huh? Figures.\u201d the deity gave a sigh of disappointment and ended the conversation with the younger-looking boy. Toshiro watched the giant\u2019s godly body fly by as he was lowered to the stomach, past the abs. He stopped in front of a large, black hole that was the teen\u2019s navel. With his finger, the look-a-like pushed Hitsugaya into his bellybutton and removed his finger with a small pop. The icy Soul Reaper found himself stuck in a big chunk of bellybutton lint, unable to move at all. The cavern was humongous, possibly big enough to fit a couple city blocks in. The abdominal muscles around him moved and flexed with the titan\u2019s movements. Eventually he sat down and Hitsugaya watched the muscles around him briefly crunch together before they retracted again as his captor spread himself out on the white desert. Jinta\u2019s clone put his arms behind his head and started to doze off, feeling a bit tired from his \u201cactivities\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji and the white-haired Jinta started at each other for a bit before the clone blurted out, \u201cHere, I wanna show you something.\u201d The clone brought Renji over to the beaten form of Jinta and shook the smaller teen with his foot. \u201cYou still alive?\u201d Jinta\u2019s pained groans were the only response he got, but at least it was enough to show he was still breathing. It took Renji a few seconds to figure out who the naked, defeated body belonged to. That head of red hair (now ruined with several splotches of cum) gave it away easily. The once mighty god that had stuck so much fear into his heart now looked like shit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the guy who destroyed your home, right? Bet you\u2019re glad to see him like this. You\u2019re probably thinking it would have been awesome if you were the one who brought him to this, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Renji didn\u2019t know what to think. Part of him was happy. Happy that this menace who had killed so many of his friends and comrades finally got what he deserved. Another part of him felt pity. He pitied the boy for all the horrible things these four had done to him. If he had been in their place, he would have made Jinta suffer\u2026but nothing like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Why are you showing me this?\u201d Renji asked, turning back to gaze of the superior being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d like to see it. Was I wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly monsters would enjoy a sight like this. That means you and\u2026him.\u201d Renji glanced at Jinta. Was the red head cruel enough to do this to someone? These Arrancars WERE his clones, after all. Could it just be because they were Arrancars and a bit more sinister than their original? Renji wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was in the teenager\u2019s capability. He did flood Soul Society in a sea of cum, after all. To think he slept under the same roof as him several times\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, moving on\u2026\u201d the clone walked away from Jinta and took his slave somewhere else. The others had already started playing with their bugs and he didn\u2019t want to feel left out. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things looked bleak. Anyone and everyone that could have been a match for these titanic copies were now broken and beaten. Soul Society was destroyed by Jinta, Hueco Mundo was the one employing these monsters, and even Jinta himself was now unable to stop them. They truly had no equal. Jinta lay on the sand, his body still bruised and beaten and covered in seed, his ego bruised worse than his body. He had tried to come up with a plan to beat these clones but nothing came to mind. He couldn't match four of him at once and he couldn't make them weaker than him since their slime was perfect. It truly seemed like he had lost at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, though Jinta had no knowledge of it, things were about to be shaken up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside the Arrancar's belly button, Hitsugaya's slime was finally activating. As he struggled in the clump of lint his body started filling with a powerful energy, glowing gold from the powerful substance inside his body bonding completely to his cells and transforming him into a god. He stopped struggling as he felt this transformation take place, his mind overwhelmed by the sudden increase in power. Swiftly, his body began to grow, shredding apart his old Soul Reaper uniform, Hyorinmaru falling from him, lost in a pile of lint, his body filling the space inside within seconds. The teen who held him had no idea what was going on, his mind blank as he slept, confident of his complete power over the speck in his navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Arrancar soon took notice of a surging spiritual pressure coming from their sleeping brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Something's going on over there!\" The one who held Ichigo shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is his spiritual pressure rising like that? It's not fair!\" The one holding Hisagi shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he's getting stronger! We're probably next!\" The one holding Renji shouted in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these comments were quickly silenced as a golden form suddenly burst forth from the clone's stomach. Blood showered those nearby, a huge hole cut deep into the clone's stomach. His eyes shot wide open, his sleep painfully broken. He yelled out and suddenly vomited blood, his slowly deteriorating eyes seeing a tall golden figure standing over him, icy blue eyes staring hard into his own. His eyes closed as life left his body finally, his mind set shattered in an instant. He wasn't a god...gods couldn't be killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three clones stared with wide eyes at this new figure before them. He stood head and shoulders taller than them, his body shrouded in golden light. He was completely naked, his body toned perfectly with muscled, his face perfect. His blue hair seemed to almost move, as though in a light breeze, but no wind was present in the deserts of Hueco Mundo. The glow slowly left the figure, leaving everyone to see who it truly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...it's that kid speck!\" One of the clones shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toshiro?\" Ichigo said, trying to crane his head to see what was going on from his current position on the teen's dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Captain...oh who cares?\" Hitsugaya said with a sigh, his voice deeper now to fit with his teenage body. He carelessly wiped the blood from his body and said, \"Well, it's about time. Now, to take care of you monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arrancar teens laughed and one said, \"Yeah right. You're still outnumbered three to one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya made a fist with one hand and said, \"That may be so, but my powers are significantly stronger than yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. The silver haired teen had the ability to change his size at will. If he wanted to he could grow to such an enormous size that he could crush all three underfoot with one step. However, if he did that he'd also crush Renji, Ichigo, and Hisagi to death and he couldn't do that. It was possible he now had the power to bring people back from the dead, but he wasn't about to test it on actual human lives. The Arrancar's, their slaves still attached to various parts of their bodies, all started surrounding Hitsugaya, planning an attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji, meanwhile, was in a turmoil. He was currently stuck on the clone's shoulder, wondering what was going on. \"This isn't fair!\" He muttered to himself. \"Why did only Hitsugaya change? This sucks! I should be changing too!\" The slime inside Renji was taking longer to activate, due to his body being of a larger size than Hitsugaya's. The slime had to work more to change him. How much longer, however, was unknown...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya kept his eye on the circling clones. He knew all of their tricks, but he had no idea what his own powers were. Likewise, the Arrancar also had no idea what his powers were. Urahara had been clear on saying he would have all of Jinta's powers...and then some, along with the ability to alter his size at will. The clones would probably be wary, waiting for him to make the first move. The newly turned god suddenly increased his size so that the Arrnacar only reached his knees, closing the distance between them in a second. The clones jumped back in surprise allowing Hitsugaya to clam his bare foot into one's stomach, sending him flying backward. The other clones quickly recovered and ran forward, ready to slice apart Hitsugaya's leg with their reality warping powers, only to find themselves suddenly face to face with the silver haired teen again. Hitsugaya took the opportunity to slam his fist into one's stomach while he elbowed the other in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...hand over the Soul Reapers you have and surrender. I won't ask again.\" Hitsugaya said with an emotionless voice. He wasn't expecting them to comply...but it would make things easier. Perhaps they would be intimidated by his powers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH RIGHT!\" The clones all shouted at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there goes that hope out the window...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The clones wasted no time in charging at Hitsugaya again. The white haired god was already in his fighting stance as the first clone threw him a punch. Toshiro ducked under it, grabbed it from below, and flipped the slightly shorter giant on his back. The second clone clumsily tripped over the first and fell right into Hitsugaya\u2019s fist. The third and last clone jumped over his fallen brothers and descended with a kick, but Toshiro easily caught it and slammed him onto the others. He smirked down at the three Jintas with his hand son his hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re really clones of Jinta, that means you have little to no training in hand-to-hand combat. As a captain, I\u2019m practically an expert. You can\u2019t hide behind your size now, monsters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe still have our abilities, though!\u201d one of the clones yelled as he charged at Hitsugaya again. The white-haired teen got ready to block another punch, but instead watched the Arrancar\u2019s fist vanish. He felt himself get punched in the cheek, much to his surprise. The clone had put his fist through a spatial tear where it then reemerged in another direction. The blow was just enough to stagger him for a few seconds; long enough for a clone to come up behind him and wrap his arm around his neck. The white haired Jinta started to put the squeeze on, intending to crush his opponent\u2019s throat. Hitsugaya put a stop to his efforts by grabbing the arm. The clone suddenly felt his arm go cold as ice started to spread around it. By the time he drew back in pain, his arm was frozen up to his elbow. It wasn\u2019t frozen for long, though, as a hard backwards kick from Hitsugaya shattered it and flung the clone backwards. The two other clones ran up to him and helped their brother back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t working. He\u2019s better at fighting than us and he has powers.\u201d the Arrancar said as he got to his feet. His hand was still a little numb from the freezing, but it\u2019ll pass quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow he get this strong anyway?\u201d another clone wondered, puzzled by this entire turn of events. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe must have slime in him like the original. All we have to do is siphon it out of him like we did to Jinta.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood plan. He\u2019ll just be another bug-sized kid after that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three clones decided on their plan and Hitsugaya watched them vanish into portals they formed behind them. He stood there, waiting for them to reappear, and they did. Two from underneath him which grabbed his legs and one from behind that caught him in a bear hug. He tried to shake them off, but they were beating him in raw strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, guys, do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clones concentrated and tried to pull the slime from Hitsugaya\u2019s body\u2026but just like Jinta, they found none in his system. Like their own, the captain\u2019s slime was completely fused to his cells and inseparable. It was part of him. Before they could realize this, they felt the flesh they were hugging start to grow. In a mere second Hitsugaya had enlarged himself to twice the clones\u2019 sizes. He cracked his knuckles and were about to pry the clones off his legs when he noticed a tiny speck on one of their shoulders. It was Renji! Hitsugaya gently and quickly snatched the small Soul Reaper up, bringing him to his own shoulder. Before Renji could ask any questions, he found himself being dropped on another shoulder. Unlike the last, this one was nice and cool. There were a few tiny white hairs for him to grab onto. With that out of the way, Toshiro grabbed the two Arrancar on his legs by their hair and lifted them up to his chest. Before the clones knew what was coming, the stronger god smashed them together and tossed them on the ground. He turned his attention to the clone hugging his back and gave the smaller giant a smirk. Hitsugaya let himself fall back, aiming to squash the clone against the sandy floor. The clone realized what he was doing just in time to open a portal behind him. When Hitsugaya didn\u2019t feel the Jinta imposter smash into the ground, he stood up and watched a portal close behind him. Lucky bastard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone reappeared near his brothers just as they were getting to their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you two okay?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Just peachy.\u201d one of them muttered as he held his bleeding head. The other had a bruised shoulder, which had whacked into his brother\u2019s head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite the clones recovered from their failed attempt to subdue Hitsugaya, the bigger giant knelt down and placed Renji on the white sands below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you injured, Abarai?\u201d the teenaged god asked as he shrunk back down so he was just slightly taller than the clones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Thanks for the rescue.\u201d he replied, craning his head up just to look his superior in the face. \u201cWhy did your slime activate and not mine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot sure. Don\u2019t worry, though, it\u2019ll only take one of us to deal with these clowns. Just wait here until I\u2019m done.\u201d Toshiro ordered as he bended the space around Renji, creating a dome that prevented him from leaving and also protected him from the battle. The white haired teen got back to his feet and faced the trio. \u201cTime for you all to chill out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he said that, his hands were thrust into the white sands. The area around him began to freeze over and was quickly approaching the three Arrancars. The trio jumped back, but one of them wasn\u2019t so lucky and was caught. His legs were quickly covered in a thick sheet of ice and his body started to grow cold. He shuddered, but that didn\u2019t last long as his torso started to freeze. His entire body was becoming trapped in an icicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you guys waiting for?! Help me!!\u201d the clone shouted as the ice approached his head. His two brothers could do nothing, as stepping anywhere near the field of ice could land them in the same position. The clone let out a yell as the ice finally covered his head, leaving only his eyes capable of movement. He watched as Hitsugaya stomped over to him, growing while he did. Once the captain was over him, he was big enough to reach down and tug the icicle free. The frozen clone was brought up to Toshiro\u2019s face and could only watch fearfully as the giant licked his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, a frozen treat. Just what I need.\u201d Hitsugaya said innocently. The clone couldn\u2019t hear him, though, since his prison blocked any sound from getting in. He knew the giant\u2019s intentions, though, as his lips parted and his pink muscle dragged itself across the icy tomb. Toshiro licked all over the frozen clone before popping half of him into his mouth. There, he started to suck on the little treat and pull it in and out of his mouth. If the clone was able to hear anything, he would have heard nothing but slurping, sucking, and the giant\u2019s own moans of satisfaction. Instead, he just saw it all in silence. Maybe that made it even scarier\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, what are we going to do? He\u2019s using one of us as a frickin popsicle!\u201d yelled one of the clones on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up hope! We\u2019re the Infinity Corps! We\u2019ll save him and then we\u2019ll show snowball who the real gods are!\u201d encouraged the other clone. \u201cHe must have just tapped into his powers, or else he would have used them before. He can\u2019t be use to his abilities yet! On the other hand, we were created with perfect control of our powers. We just have to stay alive and he\u2019ll eventually slip up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right! We\u2019re stronger than our original and he defeated thousands of Soul Reapers! We can handle one, oversized one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clones were filled with newly found morale and turned their full attention to the larger being. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright let's do this!\" Both clones shouted, heading towards the giant Hitsugaya's legs with the attention of severing them at the ankle. Hitsugaya, of course, saw them coming and quickly kicked out at them, knocking them both down like puppies trying to nip at their master's legs. The clones didn't give up, warping space and punching through it, each time their fists appearing in different areas over Hitsugaya's body. The giant Soul Reaper couldn't predict where the punches would come from and stepped back, avoiding the last round of punches and grabbing both clones by the wrists, yanking their bodies forward. In order to avoid having their arms ripped off they quickly opened the tears wider, their entire bodies pulling through until Hitsugaya had one in each hand and one his mouth. He crunched down on the one in his mouth, ripping the clone in half and spitting out his corpse onto the sand, red blood staining the expanse of gray. Hitsugaya turned his attention to the two in his hands and said, \"Now there's just you two to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clones struggled and tried to escape but there was no way they could overpower this over sized boy. Hitsugaya looked over the two clones and saw Ichigo trapped on the clone's now soft dick head, and Hisagi trapped on the other clone's nipple. He knew they were loyal to Jinta, but they had been through far worse than any other person who had had contact with Jinta. After spending so much time in the boy's pit he could understand how constant abuse like that would turn one's mind. He transferred both clone's to one hand and carefully plucked the two tiny Soul Reapers from their prisons and held them on his finger tip. He looked them over and said, \"Are you two okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded and said, \"Thanks for saving me but...I won't help you! And I won't leave Lord Jinta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either!\" Hisagi shouted. \"Don't think a false god like you can stand up to Lord Jinta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya chose not to answer. He would be able to deal with these two later. He lowered them to the same area where Renji was waiting and opened the space, adding the two with Renji. Both Soul Reapers ignored Renji and started looking anxiously around for Jinta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he? What happened to Lord Jinta?\" Ichigo asked worriedly, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! I can't see him!\" Hisagi said, his tone equal to Ichigo's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji was disgusted watching them. He had seen Ichigo not too long ago and he had been willing to fight an impossible fight even if it meant dying. Now...he was a sniveling slave to an over sized KID. Then Renji remembered exactly what it had been like, being so close to the giant, being subjected to his will. He suddenly had much more sympathy for the two Soul Reapers. He couldn't bring himself to point out where Jinta lay, broken and defeated. It might shatter their world view even more. They were going to have to eventually see the truth, that Jinta was a horrible monster that needed to be put in his place, but it would be done gently, reversing their brain washing until they were back to normal...if that was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya stood back up and looked at the clones in his hand. They were still struggling, their hands pinned at their sides, unable to do anything to stop the silver haired giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...what should I do with you two?\" He asked to himself, looking the clones over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't over!\" One shouted, still struggling. \"You can't keep us down for long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" The other shouted. \"You're nothing compared to us! Nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya couldn't help but snort at these comments. \"Please. On equal footing you and your friends were nothing to me. You're just a bunch of over sized children, arrogant as long as you're torturing creatures smaller and weaker than you. Really, you're nothing more than a group of bullies holding a magnifying glass to an ant hill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! We're gods! GODS!\" The first clone shouted again his struggling increasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya tightened his grip and the clones groaned in pain. \"Look at you now. How does it feel to be on the other side? As nothing more than insects to a greater being?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" The other clone spat. \"You're not so great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya glared icily at the boys and started increasing his size. He grew bigger and bigger, the clones shrinking away in his hand. The expressions on their faces were priceless. Slowly it dawned on them what was it was like to be a speck on the fingertip of a god. To the Soul Reapers on the ground it was almost beyond their comprehension. Hitsugaya's massive body expanded seemingly endlessly above them, his face, his chest, his stomach, soon not even his knees were visible to their sight, his massive feet rising like mountains on either side of them. For just a moment Ichigo and Hisagi felt uncertainty in their beliefs. But then they quickly remembered the miracles Jinta had pulled off, always surviving, always growing bigger and stronger. He would again. They knew it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya brought his finger tip to his eye and looked down upon the specks on his finger tip. \"Now how does it feel? You are nothing to me. Accept it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clones didn't. \"Never! You'll have to kill us first!\" They answered in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya said nothing more. He merely brought his finger back, turned it over, and watched as the specks fell. He watched as they opened a rift in space and landed gently on the sands. He then lifted his foot and smashed their bodies into the sand. That was it. It was over. Hitsugaya sighed and shrank down, down, down, until he was still bigger than Jinta, but not nearly as huge as he had been. He undid the space around Renji and the others and lifted them up to his face. \"That's it. I finished them all off. Now we just have to take the slime from Jinta and this whole nightmare will be over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya looked for the boy, ready for this whole ordeal to be over. He wasn't where he had been. There was nothing but a pile of blood and dried cum. He looked around in alarm, trying to find him. He saw him, a few feet over next to a pile of clothes, his throat working like he was swallowing something. Hitsugaya had no idea that some of Jinta's slime had been stolen and that he was currently swallowing the last of it back into his system. Soon, he would be back to his old strength.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta swallowed the last bit of his stolen slime and felt it drop into his stomach. From there, it would enter his bloodstream. He wanted his former power back. He wanted the pain he felt to disappear. Nothing of the sort happened; he needed some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJinta.\u201d he heard a voice say in the distance. The red haired god looked over at Hitsugaya, the being that had so easily defeated his clones. Fear pricked at his skin as he stood up, trying to ignore the pain that still shot through his body. He refused to look weak in the Soul Reaper\u2019s presence. \u201cIt\u2019s over, Jinta. Just give up. I don\u2019t want to put you through any more suffering than you\u2019ve already been through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta didn\u2019t say anything and just continued to stare at Toshiro. He made a movement like he was complying with the giant\u2019s request, but he refused to do anything of the sort. His hand wiped through the air and tore open another portal in reality. Hitsugaya tried to stop him but was a second too late, he was gone. He had no idea where he went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, Jinta!\u201d the young captain cursed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, see?\u201d Renji blurted out and looked over at Hisagi and Ichigo. \u201cYour god just abandoned you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d Ichigo shouted at Renji. \u201cLord Jinta is just making a tactical retreat. He\u2019ll be back for us, you just watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKurosaki\u2026\u201d Hitsugaya brought the three Soul Reapers to his face and stared at the orange haired teen in particular. \u201cIf you know where he went, tell me. This nightmare has to end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, and even if I did I wouldn\u2019t tell a false god like you!\u201d Ichigo yelled back at the titian of a boy. \u201cAre you going to torture us for information?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTorture you? Of course not! Don\u2019t be absurd!\u201d Hitsugaya relied before he dropped the three littles on his shoulder. Renji was the next one to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat now, Captain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll head back to the World of the Living and find a quiet place. I have the size changing down, but I still need to practice my other abilities. We also have to wait until the slime inside you activates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed. Once both of us have perfected our powers, we can try to undo everything Jinta\u2019s done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro turned his attention to Jinta\u2019s slaves and asked, \u201cWhat about you? What are you going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first thing Lord Jinta is going to do once he gets his power back is come after you. We\u2019ll just stick with you and wait for him to come for us.\u201d Hisagi explained. Hitsugaya said nothing more and created an exit to Earth. He stepped through it, leaving this white wasteland behind. One thing nobody noticed were the ruins of the real Las Noches, which was destroyed at some point during the battle. Aizen\u2019s body was not among the dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n++++++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta emerged from the void and hit a marble floor hard. From his kneeling position he looked around and noticed he was in some kind of throne room. He had pictured the Spirit King\u2019s realm, but was expecting to end up in the same room he was in before. The red head\u2019s gaze looked forward and spotted the Spirit King, sitting in his throne and staring emotionlessly at Jinta. The boy muttered a curse when his eyes fell upon the face. He still had his blue hair and silver eyes, but the face was of Hitsugaya\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did a good job of dealing with the Soul Reapers and Grimmjow, but it would appear that Aizen was too much for you. Those imitations did a number on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut your mouth.\u201d Jinta mumbled as he wobbled to his feet. He was right, though, those clones had thrashed him. They had beaten him, tortured him, and even raped him. He knew he looked pathetic before this majestic being, but this was only another set back. He was far from done. \u201cAre you going with him now? Is snowball your new heir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d the deity replied. \u201cWhile Toshiro is the most powerful being at the moment, his goals conflict with my own. He and his partner, Renji, plan on using their combined powers to undo everything you\u2019ve done. The people you killed will be revived, the places you destroyed will be rebuilt, and the lives you changed will be undone. This is all well and good, but my situation will go unchanged. Aizen will still have the opportunity to take my throne. Ichigo and the Soul Reapers might prevail over him, but the universe will till go without a Spirit King. Seeing you to the throne is the best option.\u201d The Spirit King paused and though about his next words. \u201cYou must still overcome Aizen and the two Soul Reapers if you desire my throne.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAizen is still alive?\u201d Jinta asked, surprised. Hitsugaya had really decimated the place during his fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe creations may have been defeated, but the mastermind still lives. He has hidden himself away and is currently sending the remainder of his Hollow/Arrancar army to attack cities all over the United States. His plan is unchanged: gather enough souls and spirit-enriched lands to create the King\u2019s Key. He\u2019ll use it to access this realm, kill me, and take my throne. If that happens, he will become more powerful than anything you can imagine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just swat him like a fly? You are God, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could\u2026if he didn\u2019t have the King\u2019s Key. Not only does it act like an arrow to direct those to my realm, but it also has the power to neutralize my powers. Don\u2019t ask me why this is so; I created the King\u2019s Key back when the universe was still in chaos. I do not remember all the details.\u201d The Spirit King paused again and tapped the edge of his arm rest. \u201cEnough about Aizen, let\u2019s talk about you. You need to rest and gather your strength back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just heal me like you did last time? I don\u2019t  have time to rest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can heal the wounds of the body, but I cannot heal your mind. What you went through on Hueco Mundo must have left mental scars. Take a day or two to rest, I will not take no as an answer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta stared at he higher god in the eyes for a bit. He was in no position to deny this guy; he could easily throw him out and into Hitsugaya\u2019s mercy. What would he do then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but once I have my power back I\u2019m going after snowball. I have to teach him who the real god is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you been listening to me at all?\u201d the Spirit King snapped. \u201cAizen is the immediate threat; he must come first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I care what you say?! I can squash that bastard any time I want! I\u2019m going to show that kid I\u2019m a god first!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what your clones said just before he slaughtered them.\u201d The Spirit King replied, sending chills down Jinta\u2019s spine. \u201cYou will rush right into your death if you fight Hitsugaya as you are now. Not to mention that by the time you are healed, Renji\u2019s power might also activate. Imagine what the two of them could do to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to run away like a coward. I always find a way to dominate my enemies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spirit King gave a long sigh before replying, \u201cVery well. If you must do that, I will try and assist you. I may have a way to make you more powerful than you\u2019ve ever been. You might stand a chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta suddenly felt something impact his gut. He noticed the Spirit King wasn\u2019t on his throne anymore, but directly in front of him. At first he though the more powerful being had decked him, but looked down to find his hand burrowed into his stomach. It didn\u2019t hurt, but the feeling\u2026of his hand\u2026in his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026are you doing?\u201d Jinta gasped as the hand removed itself, taking with it a large orb of slime. It was every ounce of his power gathered into a head-sized sphere. Jinta could feel it\u2026his power disappearing. His godhood vanishing. The realm prevented him from seeing it\u2026but he could feel himself shrinking. Looking down at himself, he watched his perfect muscles disappear slowly. His teenage body was turning back into the lean, undefined kid he once was. \u201cYou\u2026bastard\u2026I\u2019m going\u2026to kill\u2026\u201d Jinta tried to finish, but eventually passed out from shock. His naked body collapsed at the Spirit King\u2019s feet, who continued to look down at him with cold eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen next you awake, you\u2019ll have this back. It will be more than it was. Until then, sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe almost immortal being called for his guard, who took Jinta to be tended to. The deity sat back in his throne and placed Jinta\u2019s slime on his lap. He closed his eyes and began to concentrate, slowly channeling his power into the orb.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the Spirit King slowly enriched Jinta's slime with his own godly powers the guard lifted Jinta's frail, tired, worn out body into his arms and carried him to the same room he had been in before. His body still ached since the Spirit King hadn't healed him yet. When the orb rejoined his body he would be healed and granted far more power than he realized. Would it be enough to take down Renji and Hitsugaya? Would he be in time to stop Aizen's reign of terror? Only time would tell. The guard wiped away the sweat, blood and dried cum stains from the boy's body, cleaning him off and patching up a few of the still bleeding wounds. When Jinta was dry, clean, and somewhat patched up, the guard laid him out in the bed, covering him up before leaving. The guard treated him with the utmost respect, partly because he was incredibly loyal to the Spirit King and partly because Jinta was poised to BE the next Spirit King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snicked shut and Jinta moaned a little, tossing and turning. The feelings from his rape were still fresh in his mind, the experience like a film reel that kept playing over and over again. His body getting savaged, his body getting tossed around, his body getting dominated, abused, used, and tossed away like a broken toy. He had never known such cruelty. His mind didn't make the connection that he himself had been doing such horrible, deplorable acts, before meeting the clones. The very fact that they were clones spoke of the innate potential for cruelty inside Jinta. Would he go so far as to gang rape a person if he had the ability to do so? Perhaps. But since most beings were specks to him, he'd never get the chance one way or the other. Either way it didn't matter. He was god. God wasn't supposed to be treated like that. He was supposed to rise up, crush his enemies, decimate the landscape, fill the puny mortals heart's with fear! But now...he was nothing more than a tiny mortal with a god much stronger than him running around. The very thought filled his heart with rage and frustration, sadness and hopelessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese feelings were compounded as he fell into a deeper sleep and nightmares started assailing him. He twisted and turned in the bed, his face scrunched up in an expression of horror. Sweat stood out on his forehead. He dreamed he was in a featureless landscape, naked, still in his child form, vulnerable. Suddenly, the ground started vibrating. He looked around, trying to find the source of the vibrating, but couldn't see anything. The vibrating grew stronger, becoming a rumbling, then a booming. Jinta felt his heart pound faster. What was going on? He looked around again and saw, in the distance, a figure approaching. He watched in fear as the booming became louder, stronger, the ground started to move under his feet. The figure continued to get closer...closer...the features suddenly became recognizable to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrot top?\" he whispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, it was Ichigo approaching, though much, MUCH bigger than Jinta had ever seen him. His footsteps were causing the ground to shake and warp underneath him, throwing Jinta around like a rag doll. Soon, an enormous bare foot landed next to him, the toes stretching almost higher up than he could see. Another landed a distance away, slamming into the ground though the step was light. Jinta quaked, looking up. He couldn't see past Ichigo's knees, let alone see his face. A voice rumbled down to him from on high. \"Where's Lord Jinta? Isn't he supposed to be the greatest god in the universe? Why would he be hiding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta tried to shout and get Ichigo's attention, but failed, his foot moving slightly into the air, moving over top of him! \"Oh well...guess I'll look for him elsewhere.\" The foot came down upon Jinta, crushing him into oblivion. His former worshiper had crushed him unknowingly like a bug. Such was Jinta's feelings of inferiority after his experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis nightmare flew smoothly into the next, Jinta now standing on top of a warm, peach colored landscape that stretched in all directions. A massive eye suddenly filled the sky, glaring own at Jinta with a malice he hadn't felt since Grimmjow was alive. Of course, it was Grimmjow in this nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get licking kid! You thought you were a god? Don't make me laugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta found a massive finger tip press him forcibly against whatever part of Grimmjow's body he was on, the pressure immense. He stuck out his tongue and licked, the taste filling his mouth. Such was Jinta's feelings of humiliation after his experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare after nightmare assailed Jinta's mind. Hisagi playing with his body in the same way Jinta had played with his, Hitsugaya forcing him into slavery, Renji forcing him to worship his body, all ending with a replay of his breaking at the hands of the Infinity Corps. Hour after hour, Jinta replayed these nightmares, and many others besides them, until he was weeping in his sleep, curled up into a ball. He had been reduced back to what he truly was: a hurt, frightened little boy. The Spirit King could sense this change and hastened his efforts. After the orb was integrated in Jinta's body his confidence, ego, and arrogance would come back along with his power.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta\u2019s hellish nightmares went on for a good half-day before the Spirit King finally finished perfecting the slime. The deity entered Jinta\u2019s room to find the boy tossing and turning; his body covered with his own sweat. The Spirit King was holding something in his hands, but a cloth was draped over it. He removed the cloth to reveal a brilliant light that no mortal eyes could look at. At the core of the light was the orb of slime: the result of Kisuke\u2019s genius and the Spirit King\u2019s will. The god removed the blanket from Jinta\u2019s slumbering form and, using his powers, pinned the boy still. As the red head fought against his power, the Spirit King slowly lowered the orb into the child\u2019s stomach. The light sank into his flat belly where it then quickly spread across his entire body; almost as if the slime was sentient and eager to return to its host. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Jinta\u2019s nightmare, the former god was all but dead. He laid on an invisible ground, bloodied, beaten, and crying. Standing high above him were his nightmares, whom had surrounded him in a circle of giants. Ichigo, Hisagi, Hitsugaya, Renji, Grimmjow, and even the Infinity Corps all grinned down at the defeated bug at their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFace it, original,\u201d one of the clones spoke. \u201cYou were never meant to be God. You\u2019re just a pathetic speck.\u201d The clone raised his foot above the whimpering child, ready to stomp the pest flat. \u201cBye, bug.\u201d The white haired Arrancar stomped down hard and grinded his foot into the ground. He was about to erupt in laughter with his fellow gods when he suddenly noticed his foot start to get hot. An unbelievably strong force started to push against it and soon lifted the foot a  few inches off the ground. From the spot where Jinta had laid came a radiant light that blinded each one of the giants. The clone\u2019s foot was easily tossed aside as the light began to take on a human shape. The nightmares watched as the figure grew larger and larger before them. Once it had reached their height, it started to show physical features of Jinta. Jinta continued to grow past the circle of giants and the group found themselves forced back by Jinta\u2019s humongous form. Their efforts to escape his growing body were soon halted, though, as the boy\u2019s spiritual pressure weighed down on them and forced each one to their knees. Now they could only watch in horror as Jinta\u2019s growing feet quickly caught up to them and overcame their miniscule bodies. Jinta looked down at his body, which was perfect once again, and pumped his fists into the air. Any angst he had previously felt seemed to melt away as he grew bigger and bigger. He didn\u2019t seem to be slowing down either, which pleased him greatly. For the next few hours, he did nothing but grow. He enjoyed each second of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jinta finally left the realm of dreams, he had a smile on his face. His nightmare-turned-paradise was fresh in his mind. When he recalled the last thing that happened to him before he lost consciousness, he bolted upright. The first thing he noticed: no pain. The second: his body was back to its muscular teenage appearance. Third: it was once again flawless. Any sign that he was dominated and raped was gone. A few bandages covered him, but tearing them off revealed not even a scar underneath. With a grin of confidence he leaped out of bed and started jogging around the room, doing jumping jacks, and even some push ups. He felt better than ever before. He felt like a new guy\u2026a new Jinta\u2026a new god. After finishing an exercise routine made for a star athlete (without breaking a sweat, to boot) Jinta examined the room and spotted some clothes neatly folded on a chair for him. They were exactly like his previous ones, but that was fine with him. His ascension into godhood hadn\u2019t changed his fashion interests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making himself decent, Jinta opened the door to find himself in another, slightly larger room. It was a dining room of sorts and the only person inside was the Spirit King; calmly sipping from a cup of tea. His appearance this time was\u2026different. It was no longer Hitsugaya\u2019s, yet it wasn\u2019t Jinta\u2019s either. It was like a combination of the two. Jinta would soon change that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked. I expected the slime to take at least another eight hours to spread through your body. It only took two.\u201d he said, despite showing zero facial expressions that proved he was surprised. \u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot any soda?\u201d Jinta asked, not much of a fan of tea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spirit King snapped his fingers and a bottle of cola materialized on the table. Jinta snatched it up, unscrewed the top, and started gulping it down. In a few seconds, the contents of the bottle were in Jinta\u2019s stomach and the teen tossed the empty container on the floor. He pounded his chest and released a loud and mighty belch. The belch was so intense that the Spirit King\u2019s cup of tea shattered in his hands. If Jinta had any appreciation for the Spirit King\u2019s efforts, he definitely wasn\u2019t showing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what are you going to do now that I have restored your powers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have to ask? I\u2019m heading back to Earth to show snowball and Aizen who the real God is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume you have a plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Crush anything that gets in my way!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must not underestimate Hitsugaya and Renji. I may have given you power like never before, but they too possess great power. If you don\u2019t be careful you\u2019ll end up in the same position as last time. I cannot save you a third time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, those false gods don\u2019t scare me! The only reason snowball defeated those fakers was because he could grow bigger than them. I can do the same thing now, right? I\u2019ll just grow to match him\u2026or maybe even BIGGER than he can get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what about Aizen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBah, what is that puny Soul Reaper gonna do? All he has is a toothpick that can make illusions and an army of specks. He\u2019s nothing to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree, but the gap between your abilities is not the problem.\u201d explained the blue-haired good. \u201cTime is the problem. If you do not defeat Aizen before he creates the King\u2019s Key\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen he\u2019ll come here and take your throne, thus becoming Spirit King before me.\u201d Jinta finished, rolling his eyes. \u201cBig deal! I\u2019ll still trample him! In fact\u2026maybe I\u2019ll let him become Spirit King first so I can have someone worthy to fight for the throne.\u201d Jinta smiled evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be very unwise.\u201d The Spirit King snapped, giving Jinta stern look. The red haired god ignored him and without so much as a thanks, opened a portal to the World of the Living and stepped through. The Spirit King was left alone with a very bad feeling\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta stepped out in familiar territory: Japan. Full of useless specks that had submitted to him. He had no eyes for these mortals though. He had bigger fish to fry, namely a snowy kid who thought he could match Lord Jinta! Jinta looked around, expecting to see silver haired Soul Reaper nearby, training or something, but he was nowhere to be found. Jinta scratched his head in confusion and a little annoyance. He was all fired up and had been looking forward to stomping snowball into the ground. Now that no one was around he felt like he was missing out on something. Determined, he set off across the landscape, looking for Hitsugaya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jinta arrived in the World of the Living, Hitsugaya, his three Soul Reaper companions on his shoulder, was arriving on the shores of California. He pulled his huge body out of the water, shaking his head, his hair quickly spiking up in its natural style. To the Americans nearby, it was truly an awe inspiring sight. Hitsugaya truly looked like a young god, his body toned and perfectly proportioned, a look of calm serene on his face. He looked down at the specks surrounding his feet and smiled slightly. \"Don't worry. I'm not here to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the people believed him. There was something greatly calming about him. They all stared up at him as he walked carefully over and around them. He had come here with a purpose, and that purpose was finding and killing Aizen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving Hueco Mundo Hitsugaya had, using his god like powers, sensed a fleeing presence leaving Hueco Mundo along with them. He knew it had to be Aizen. As though to confirm it, hundreds of other presences had suddenly appeared around him, each one belonging to a different Hollow or Arrancar. Aizen was making his last stand to make the King's Key. This was their last chance to find him and eradicate him once and for all. He could have easily opened a portal to where Aizen was, as Renji had suggested, but Hitsugaya knew better. Aizen was no fool. He would probably be expecting something like that. Hitsugaya had no idea how much energy Aizen would need to make the key, but if he didn't do something it wouldn't take long. Hitsugaya had searched out where the presences were and he had found that they were in America. So, he had decided to traverse the ocean, making an effective sneak attack. He wouldn't have time to train up his powers, but there really was no time to be had. Crossing the ocean had been easy. He had made himself large enough that he could just walk, but had bent reality around him to hide his huge body and make sure he wasn't creating any waves. When he had reached land, he had decreased his size to better move about the humans. He had also clothed himself so that he wouldn't be wandering around naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, all he had to do was find Aizen and take him out. He closed his eyes and felt around for Aizen and his army's presences. Soon, he located them. They weren't far off, wreaking havoc in Los Angeles, one of the larger cities in the state. He had to think carefully...how was he going to go about this? He could easily devour/destroy the Hollows that Aizen employed but Aizen himself would be a challenge. He would have to attack him swiftly and secretly. It would be better if he had some back up...he looked down at Renji and said, \"Do you think your slime will activate any time soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji tried to see if he could feel anything happening to his body, but he couldn't tell if anything was. He shrugged and said, \"Dunno. It could be awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we don't have time to wait. Looks like I'll be handling this alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be worried about that.\" Ichigo suddenly said. \"Even you die Lord Jinta will return to us and take out Aizen and his pathetic army, just wait and see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi nodded and said, \"This is nothing for him. Just don't get in his way or he might step on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji growled and shouted, \"Shut up you two! I've had enough of your zealotry! If you're not going to help then don't even talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo and Hisagi smirked at each other and said, \"You'll see soon enough. Lord Jinta will show you the light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya held up his hand in front of them and said, \"Enough. We're going to fix you two up just as soon as all this is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo and Hisagi both ignored this statement, crossing their arms and closing their eyes. They didn't want to hear it. They were loyal to Lord Jinta and that was that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back in Japan, Jinta had looked over the whole archipelago, twice, and still hadn't found anyone besides the mortals. He stomped his foot in annoyance, the shock waves radiating out from his bare foot. \"Where the hell is everyone? This is really starting to piss me off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jinta had been more savvy with his powers he would have known to sense Hitsugaya, his worshipers, Renji, or even Aizen. Since he wasn't, he was left in the dark. He crossed his arms and thought back to what the Spirit King had said when he had first come before him. He skipped over the parts where he tried to tell him what to do and suddenly remembered correctly. The United States! That was where Aizen was, causing trouble. Of course, he had been doing so for a half day. By the time Jinta arrived, who knew what would be going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot thinking about it, Jinta dove into the water and started swimming towards America.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hitsugaya carefully walked toward the mass of spiritual pressure, maneuvering around any other cities that were in his way. Even with his caution, the giant could not prevent some massive property damage. No one was hurt in his trek, luckily. The humans below had heard of the giants in Japan, but this one was unlike the ones from the news. He had a gentle face and didn\u2019t seem to wish them any harm. Despite this, they knew well enough to get out of his way, just to be on the safe side. The 10th Squad captain was several miles from Los Angeles when he started to hear the screaming. Looking in the distance, he spotted the large city. It was the second biggest city in the U.S., which made it a prime target for Aizen\u2019s soul collecting. The renegade Soul Reaper\u2019s army had already caused much destruction to the city. Smoke littered the air above it and fires had broken out anywhere. City folk were everywhere, trying desperately to escape the invisible Hollows. Very few of the humans had the ability to see the creatures, and thus only few saw their doom in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hollows were alerted of the young giant\u2019s presence when he arrived at the edge of the city. They did not stop their feast of human souls, however. They were instructed to harvest spiritual energy and stop for no reason. Toshiro took a moment to come up with a plan. He couldn\u2019t just run in there and start smashing Hollows; there would be thousands of human casualties. He would have to deal with the problem from outside the city. Using his godly senses, the titanic Soul Reaper picked out all the Hollows in the city and focused only on them. Using his gravity powers, each of the monsters were lifted from the streets and hovered helplessly above the city\u2019s skyscrapers. Hitsugaya smiled at the mass of tiny Hollows, which seemed almost like a living cloud, began to gather them all up into one clump. Once they were all squashed together like some deformity, the white head froze them all into an orb of ice. With the orb resting on his palm, the teenage god grinned at the weak Hollows and gave the sphere a mighty punch. Each one of the Hollows shattered into millions of pieces that harmless fell onto the city like snow. Hitsugaya wiped his hands off and placed them on his hips, congratulating himself on a job well done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe survivors in Los Angeles gazed up at their savior with mixed feelings. The boy had saved them, but they couldn\u2019t help but cower before his intimidating form. Hitsugaya gave them all a kind smile and said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright now. You don\u2019t have to be scared any longer. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d The mortals all seemed to believe him and began to cheer. Hitsugaya appreciated their thanks, but his work wasn\u2019t done yet. He was about to search for Aizen\u2019s spiritual pressure when something else distracted him. More Hollows began to appear from Gargantas; these ones Gillain-class. The Gillain surrounded the god, but only reached dup to his knees. Regardless, they began firing red ceros at him like they would any opponent. The weak beams of light didn\u2019t even tickle Hitsugaya. The Soul Reaper made a fist with one of his hands and formed a sword of ice in it. Using the giant blade, he began to cut up each one of the Gillain. His strokes caused catastrophic damage to the earth, but he made sure no one would be caught up in the destruction. After just five swipes of his ice blade, the Hollows had all been vanquished. Hitsugaya wasn\u2019t even the least bit tired. This was too easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAizen! Your puny army is nothing compared to me! Show yourself and let\u2019s end this!\u201d Hitsugaya shouted, his voice echoing for miles. It wasn\u2019t long before he got a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dear Hitsugaya-kun. You sure have grown. Do you feel powerful? Do you think you can kill me with your power?\u201d came Aizen\u2019s calm voice, seemingly from all around the giant. Hitsugaya couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t yous top hiding like a coward and we\u2019ll find out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilly child. I\u2019m already before you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro\u2019s expression was perplexed . He didn\u2019t understand what the bastard meant until he heard a soft chuckle\u2026coming from his shoulder. Hitsugaya looked down to see Aizen standing with Ichigo and Hisagi, who had jumped back at the sudden appearance of their worst enemy. But\u2026where was Renji?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen did you get there?! What did you do with Renji?!\u201d Hitsugaya yelled at Aizen, his face quickly changing from a kind smile to a pissed appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbarai? While you were dealing with those Hollows, I was busy slaughtering him. He\u2019s right there.\u201d Aizen pointed down to the city. Hitsugaya looked in the direction the man was pointing. He spotted the red haired Soul Reaper on the roof of a skyscraper. He was covered in blood, half his stomach was missing, and he was missing an arm. Hitsugaya was dumbfounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-when\u2026how\u2026\u201d Hitsugaya clenched his teeth and gave Aizen a death glare. \u201cAIZEN!!! YOU BASTARD!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white-clad Soul Reaper simply smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++++++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji was totally confused. One minute he was watching his giant comrade make mincemeat out of some Hollows, the next he was screaming at him. Hitsugaya was looking straight at him with pure hate in his eyes. Ichigo and Hisagi also looked like they saw a ghost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys\u2026what\u2019s wrong? Why are looking at me like that?\u201d Renji asked, looking into the other Soul Reaper\u2019s frightened faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAizen, you bastard! Renji was an asshole, but he didn\u2019t deserve to die!\u201d Ichigo yelled at him. Wha-? What the heck was he talking about? Had he gone\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. Kyoka Suigetsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdiots! It\u2019s me! I\u2019m not Aizen!\u201d Renji tried to reason with the two teens, but neither could hear him. Aizen\u2019s hypnosis completely muted him. Before he could say another word, two peach colored walls surrounded him and gripped him tightly. Toshiro gripped \u201cAizen\u201d between his fingers and brought the man up to his giant eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAizen, you\u2019re going to pay for this! I\u2019ve waited so long for this.\u201d Hitsugaya threatened coldly, his kind nature all but evaporated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain! It\u2019s me! You\u2019re being tricked by Aizen! Snap out of it!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Renji shivered as he stared into Hitsugaya's eye. There was nothing in there except a blazing hatred. Renji was totally powerless, his sword long since eaten by Jinta and his arms pinned at his sides. There was no kido that would be able to wound the massive captain anyway. Renji didn't even bother trying to struggle. If this was it, the end, there was nothing he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Hitsugaya, the friend in his hand was nothing more than the smirking face of his greatest enemy, the man who had orchestrated death, destruction, and had plans of domination. And now...he was in his grip, totally at his mercy. And yet...something didn't seem right. This was almost too easy. It was true that Hitsugaya now had the power of a god and that should make Aizen just another insect to him but...why did he allow himself to be captured? Why was he calmly staring up at him as though nothing was wrong? This had the makings of a trap all over it. He increased his grip and still, Aizen didn't change his expression. Hmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji looked fearfully up as Hitsugaya just stared. He hated this waiting. The people below at Hitsugaya's feet were all looking up at the god teen, wondering what was going to happen. They knew that their lives were at stake in this situation, though they didn't understand who these giants were or where they had come from. In all reality, they were merely innocent civilians caught up between a battle of the gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya was prepared to move ahead. He held what he believed to be Aizen in one hand and gripped his arm in the other. With little to no pressure he managed to snap Aizen's arm, the bone breaking cleanly. Aizen merely stared up at him and said, \"Does this bring you some kind of pleasure Hitsugaya-kun? Holding me...breaking my bones...will this really undo any of the damage I've already done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...but it'll stop you from doing anything like it again.\" He snapped the other arm in the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji screamed out in pain again. This was like torture. Why didn't the captain just kill him? Crush him? Finish him off? This pain...it was cruel. He had broken bones before but this was unlike any other time before it. This was pain mixed with the anticipation that he was going to be killed...and there was absolutely nothing he could do to stop it. He breathed heavily, both arms hanging uselessly at his sides. Hitsugaya switched his grip and grabbed the leg, snapping it. Renji cried out again, no one hearing him, no one helping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta took a deep breath as he started to tread water still quite a ways away from California. He had created numerous disturbances in the ocean, the waters getting stirred up by his body, tidal waves radiating out from his body. He wasn't being nearly as careful as Hitsugaya. He growled in frustration and kept swimming. If he didn't see land soon he was going to increase his size until this ocean was a puddle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in California, Hitsugaya had broken all of Aizen's limbs and he was still staring at him calmly with the same expression. For every limb that had been broken, he had had a deprecating remark to impart on Hitsugaya each one making him angrier and angrier. But he showed no expression of pain, not even when the limbs broke, the sound like a gunshot, clear and loud. This wasn't right. Hitsugaya closed his eyes tight and spread his senses out. Just barely...he could feel a crack somewhere. Aizen's Kyoka Suigetsu was able to create near perfect illusions. NEAR perfect. To someone with Hitsugaya's powers this was nothing that couldn't be broken...it was just a matter of finding the chink in the armor. He carefully passed his senses over the entire area until he managed to find it. He forced his influence into it and he felt the illusion shatter around him. He blinked a few times and looked down. His blood ran cold and his anger boiled even higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji lay, broken, with a look of hopelessness and fear on his face. Hitsugaya brought Renji up to his face and said, \"I'm sorry Renji...I didn't mean to let something like this happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji looked up in disbelief and said, \"You...can see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya nodded and said, \"I'm going to make Aizen pay for this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his hand over Renji and healed his tortured bones. The red haired Soul Reaper slowly sat up and tested his limbs. They felt tender but otherwise good. Hitsugaya deposited him on his shoulder and said, \"Now...for Aizen.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Behind Hitsugaya, in the same city he had arrived in upon entering California, the citizens were still recovering from Hitsugaya\u2019s arrival. While many didn\u2019t think they were in danger and thought of Hitsugaya\u2019s arrival from the sea as some holy sign, many others couldn\u2019t wait to flee the city and head in the opposite direction as the giant white head. They would be the smart ones\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHardly seeming like an hour since the young god had arrived at their shores, the Americans suddenly noticed something else heading their way, and fast. At first it looked like giant head of red hair, but they could soon make out a titanic body attached to that hair. Jinta, having swam for longer than he had liked, finally saw land and swam right towards it. Once he reached it, he pulled his body out of the water and the bugs below him got their second glimpse of a god. Jinta dripped with sea water and his white shirt clung to his teenage body, leaving little for the spectators to imagine. With a quick movement of his hand, Jinta drew all the water form his clothes and hair and tossed it back into the ocean. Placing his hands on his hips, the red head looked down at the crowd gathered before him. The crowd stared up at Jinta for a good few seconds, believing he was another gentle giant like the kind young man from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hell are you bugs looking at?\u201d Jinta boomed as he raised his foot and stomped the crowd into nothingness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy, they were wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, now they start screaming.\u201d Jinta said as the city erupted into chaos with that one simple action. The specks below him tried their best to run from the giant, but those that were nearby were simply crushed as Jinta made his way deeper into the city. His hand passed over his stomach as he felt it rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwimming across the Pacific sure makes a god hungry! You specks will have to do.\u201d  Jinta raised his hand and began to gather hundreds of tiny morsels into his palm. One second, the citizens were running from the giant, the next they were flying through the air toward the outstretched hand. After gathering several hundred victims, Jinta brought the handful to his mouth and dropped his snack in. Taking a few seconds to swish the squirming meat around his mouth, Jinta swallowed the mortals without chewing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmh.\u201d Jinta hummed as he smacked his lips. \u201cIt might just be me, but Americans have a lot more flavor to them than Japanese. I always did like American food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta rampaged through the city, gathering a few more tasty handfuls. After the fourth, he licked his lips and burped with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the snack, but I can\u2019t spent all day stuffing my face. I have bigger fish to fry.\u201d Jinta waved the survivors goodbye and stomped out of the city, leaving several more crushed buildings as a farewell gift. The moment he stepped on U.S. soil, he could sense Hitsugaya somewhere in this direction. That false god had nowhere to hide\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral miles ahead, Hitsugaya was having a poor time locating Aizen in Los Angeles. Every time he thought he sensed the Soul Reaper\u2019s spiritual pressure, it would vanish seconds later. Aizen may be an insect to him, but he was a crafty insect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t working.\u201d Hitsugaya muttered, massaging his temples in irritation. \u201cHe might not even be here anymore. He could be in a different city planning another attack.\u201d Hitsugaya turned to Renji, hoping the Soul Reaper had an idea, but the small man was looking off in the opposite direction. He couldn\u2019t blame him; he had almost died by his hands. It was probably hard to look the giant in the eyes right now. The 10th captain was about to resume his search somewhere else when something suddenly caught his attention. Turning around, Hitsugaya focused his senses in hopes that he was wrong, but only confirmed his worries. An impossibly huge spiritual pressure, like his own, had appeared. He should have noticed it sooner, but he was so busy searching for Aizen\u2019s spiritual pressure. This power could only belong to one being\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit.\u201d the young god cursed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Hisagi asked, not really paying attention to anything till now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Jinta. He\u2019s here and he\u2018s somehow become even more powerful than before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! Lord Jinta is here?\u201d the former vice-captain repeated. He turned to Ichigo, who was also grinning like a child. \u201cLord Jinta\u2019s come for us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToshiro, you\u2019ve done a good job up till now, but if I were you I\u2019d shrink back down to normal and let Lord Jinta take care of the rest.\u201d Ichigo suggested to the giant captain. He knew Hitsugaya had no place being a god, but he didn\u2019t was to see him get hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdiot! You think we\u2019ll just stand down and let that brat make us slaves again? Forget it!\u201d Renji shouted at the younger teen. \u201cCaptain Hitsugaya, we have to set a trap for the kid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a better idea.\u201d Hisagi jumped in. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try speaking with Lord Jinta? He\u2019s not always such a bad guy. If you spoke with him, he might consider making a truce so you can fight Aizen together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Toshiro scratched his chin. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what that kid can do, he might just let Aizen become Spirit King just so he can have someone powerful to dominate. Still\u2026it\u2019s worth a try. I hate to allow Aizen to run free, but I can\u2019t go looking for him with Jinta right behind me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji appeared displeased. Talk with him? They were going to talk to the monster that had destroyed Soul Society and taken thousands of lives? The monster who\u2019s clones were just about the only things more cruel than Aizen himself? The monster who had replaced the moon with a replica of his face!? It was unbelievable! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite Renji's protests Hitsugaya continued walking toward Jinta's location. He was merciless, cruel, and focused only on himself but he was also clever, cunning, and able to outdo his opponents through sheer force of will. He was an invaluable asset in fighting against Aizen. Any kind of damage or death could be undone after Renji's powers awakened anyway so it didn't matter what happened. The idea of killing anyone unnecessarily made Hitsugaya cringe but he knew he had to do what he could to stop Aizen...and then Jinta. This was a plan that would require him to gain Jinta's trust...and then, eventually, back stab him. He closed his eyes and clenched his fist. The whole plan was too much like something Aizen would come up with. He pushed this from his mind as he saw Jinta in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo and Hisagi lit up seeing their god and started jumping up and down waving. After so long away from their god they were happy to see him in such high spirits again. Renji was, of course, not happy to see him in the slightest. He was never going to forgive the boy for what he had done and would continue doing if left unchecked. Trying to reason with him was pointless. Even if Hitsugaya managed to get him to help them he would back stab them the second Aizen was taken care of. He wanted nothing more to do with him. If nothing else he wanted the kid to be punished for his atrocities. When his powers awakened he was going to make sure that he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta saw the white haired false god approaching and smirked. \"Well, well, well, looks like Snowy is saving me the trouble of looking for him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya stopped when he was a few feet in front of Jinta. They were the same height now. \"I'm not here to fight you Jinta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta laughed and said, \"Yeah, because you don't want to get your ass kicked! So are you saying you're here to submit to me? It'd make my job easier! Then I could worry about breaking you in and taking care of Aizen. So if you want to give up just lay down in front of me and start shrinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mouthy little brat!\" Renji yelled suddenly. \"Trying to get this kid to help you is an exercise in futility! Let's just stomp him again and get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta frowned and flicked Renji off Hitsugaya's shoulder before anyone could do anything. Renji went flying backward, caught at the last second by Hitsugaya. His body was almost broken again from the attack. This was already not going well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Jinta! We knew you'd come back to us!\" Ichigo shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta smiled and said, \"Hey there carrot top! Looks like you and sixty nine face are doing fine! Come back to me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo and Hisagi both eagerly jumped from Hitsugaya's shoulder into the open air. Jinta gathered them closer with his gravity powers and put them on his shoulder. \"There. Back where you belong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya put Renji on his shoulder, healing the wounds that Jinta just gave him, and said, \"Enough! I didn't come here to give myself up to you! I'm here to offer you a truce. Aizen is a greater force than either of us can take out. But working together we can finish him off for good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta laughed, hard, grabbing his stomach. \"That's hilarious! You actually think that speck is a match for me in any way? Give me a break! Thanks for the laugh though Snowy. See you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed roughly past Hitsugaya and continued on his way to find Aizen. Hitsugaya grabbed his arm and said, \"I'm serious! Either you're going to work with me or you're going to be subjugated before I continue looking for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta grew until his arm was too thick to be grabbed. He shoved Hitsugaya to the ground and planted a foot on his chest. \"I don't think you get it Snowy. I'm a god. A GOD! I don't get beaten by pathetic little bugs with big ideas and I don't need help from people like you except to lick my feet! So how about this? I'll help you if you beg for it! Get down on your hands and knees and pledge yourself to me! Then I'll help you take out this would be god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya glared coldly up at Jinta. \"I would never submit to you! If you won't help me I'll take Aizen out myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta laughed and said, \"Not what you were saying a few minutes ago. You have no confidence in your own power. I, however, do! So just stay out of my way Snowy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kicked Hitsugaya away and laughed before heading back towards the city where he could sense Aizen. Renji growled and said, \"See? He won't listen to reason! You should just beat him down and then take out Aizen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya stared at Jinta's retreating back. What could he do to get the boy to help him? Was there anything he could do? He ran up to Jinta and said, \"If...I promise to serve you after all this will you promise to focus all your efforts on taking care of Aizen and not try and kill me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta grinned and clapped Hitsugaya on the shoulder. \"Sure! It's not like I couldn't just stomp you and Aizen at the same time but having you willingly submit to me is just too hilarious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up Ichigo and Hisagi to Hitsugaya and said, \"Say hi to your newest slave boys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo and Hisagi obediently bowed and greeted Hitsugaya. Jinta laughed again and said, \"Alright! Follow my lead and let's take out Aizen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya followed the boy giving Renji a meaningful look. Words were just words. Once Aizen was out of the way he could focus on taking out Jinta. By then Renji will probably have awakened his powers and taking out Jinta would be easier. Unless Jinta grew more powerful...this could turn out to be a big mistake on his part. He didn't even know what kind of powers Jinta had right now. Were they just the same as his own? Or did he get something more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, he had to live with his choice now, come what may.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an unbelievable sight to behold. Two gods (or, as Jinta liked to think of it, one god and an oversized slave) both marching across the state of California. Jinta was always in front, with Hitsugaya right behind him. The smug giant would never allow the false god to walk beside him or, god forbid, in front of him. As the two trekked through the foreign landmass, neither could truly understand the amount of havoc they were causing the poor U.S. citizens below. What was a simple step to the giants upset the earth they walked on and ripped it asunder. Even Hitsugaya, who didn\u2019t mean anyone harm, couldn\u2019t keep track of every insignificant speck at his feet. Occasionally, someone would be lucky enough to survive Jinta\u2019s feet, only to be unknowingly stepped on by the white haired god and crushed into the dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Toshiro was focused on Aizen\u2019s spiritual pressure, his eyes were glued to Jinta\u2019s broad back. He could fully understand Renji\u2019s contempt; he also wished Jinta to pay for what he had done to Soul Society. For now, however, he would need to bury his hate and work with the monster of a boy. No matter how sickening it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem really interested in my back.\u201d Jinta suddenly spoke up, turning his head and grinning at Toshiro. \u201cLike what you see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya glared at the red head and turned away before replying, \u201cDon\u2019t be absurd.\u201d Jinta chuckled and resumed looking forward, occasionally flexing his back muscles for Hitsugaya.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two reached the edge of another large city. Even before it entered their sights, they could already make out the screaming. Now that they were looking down at it, they saw the entire metropolis being attacked by Hollows and Arrancar. The evil creatures were slaughtering every living thing in sight and consuming them. The sight brought disgust to Hitsugaya, while Jinta didn\u2019t seem to be bothered. He seemed more interested in looking past the bloodshed and finding the one bug that mattered; Aizen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Aizen, come on out! Your humiliating death is long overdo!\u201d Jinta shouted before lifting on of his titanic feet and stomping down on the city, crushing everything under it (Hollow and human alike) into oblivion. Hitsugaya moved to stop him, but held back. He couldn\u2019t risk angering the red haired god and causing a fight to break out between them. They needed to focus their bloodlust on the real enemy. Toshiro merely looked away as Jinta stomped to his heart\u2019s content, trying to smoke out Aizen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can be undone. It can be undone .\u201d Hitsugaya repeated to himself, knowing none of these deaths were permanent as long as he could defeat Jinta in the end. The people of the city, however, believed without a doubt that these were their last moments. First they were attacked by invisible forces that slaughtered them indiscriminately, now two titans had arrived and one of them was bringing complete destruction to them all. To the unlucky mortals, it was hard to imagine how these two events could be linked at all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of nonstop stomping, Jinta had decimating almost the entire city. Despite his work, he didn\u2019t look pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense. I keep thinking I\u2019m crushing that insect\u2019s spiritual pressure, but it just appears somewhere else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably a trick on some sort.\u201d Toshiro deduced, having experienced the same thing. \u201cAizen may not even be in the city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, thanks for the heads up, slave.\u201d Jinta glanced at the former 10th Squad captain with a smirk. \u201cYou could have spoke up BEFORE I started squishing!\u201d Jinta bellowed with laughter as he brought his foot down on a skyscraper that was still standing. Hitsugaya had to actually grip his wrist to stop himself from slugging the bastard right in the face. As he tried to calm himself down, he suddenly noticed something odd. Strange streams of light were emerging from underneath Jinta\u2019s foot and speeding off into the distance. Not only from under his foot, but all across the ruins of the city. Further inspection revealed that even more streams of light shooting across the sky from other cities, probably also under attack by Aizen\u2019s forces. Toshiro followed these strange lights with his eyes and noticed they were all collecting on a nearby mountain. Being a Soul Reaper, Hitsugaya identified these lights as souls. If that was the case, then the only reason they would be joining together like this is if\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJinta, take a look at that.\u201d Toshiro pointed over at the mountain where all the souls were assembling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s <i>Lord</i> Jinta to you, bug.\u201d Jinta scolded before looking to where Hitsugaya was pointing. A smirk spread across his face as he saw the pretty little light show. \u201cWell, looks like something\u2019s going on over there! Let\u2019s take a look.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n++++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAizen had one arm held in front of his chest, palm open. His eyes were closed and he was concentrating on gathering all the lost souls from across the state into his hand. When the big bad heard a few stomps coming his way, he opened his eyes and looked up to see the grinning face of Jinta. The red head had followed the souls and found him on a cliff, alone and completely unprotected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally found you!\u201d Jinta exclaimed as he folded his muscular arms over his equally muscular chest. He was giving his best intimidating smirk to Aizen, but the speck-sized Soul Reaper didn\u2019t even blink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, we finally meet face-to-face, boy.\u201d Aizen said calmly before turning his attention to the other titan behind Jinta. A titan he knew very well. \u201cAnd this is quite a surprise. Captain Hitsugaya, you must be very desperate to join forces with the same person that murdered all your friends and comrades.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it means taking you down, I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d Toshiro replied, keeping a straight face. \u201cEven throw away my pride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026unfortunately, you\u2019re too late. I have almost gathered enough souls to complete the King\u2019s Key. You helped greatly, boy. Did you know that? With Soul Society in ruins and the Soul Reapers all but extinct, there is no where for the souls of the people you kill to go. They linger here and my army harvests them like a feast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta looked down at Aizen\u2019s hand and saw, at the center of the blinding light, a complex key being made. The key wasn\u2019t complete, though, and still lacked a few parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s what you\u2019ve devoted your life to obtain? Let me show you what I think of your little toy.\u201d Jinta raised his fist into the air and slammed it down on the cliff. The impact broke the mountain in two and caused a rockslide that fell harmlessly around the two giants\u2019 feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is just a means to an end.\u201d came Aizen\u2019s voice. The two giants looked tot their side to see Aizen standing in mid air, completely unhurt. Not even his white uniform was dirtied. \u201cYou may think of it how you wish, but know that it is with this key that I will obtain limitless power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat limitless power you\u2019re talking about? It\u2019s going to be MINE when I\u2019m finished with you!\u201d Jinta began to approach Aizen to end the little speck, but was stopped when the sky started to rip apart. In actuality, it wasn\u2019t ripping apart, it was just that so many Garganta portals were opening at the same time that it appeared that way. From these portals, Hollows and Arrancar poured out like water from a faucet. They all gathered around their master like a shield. When the Garganta finally closed, the two young titans were faced against what looked like a living cloud. Each particle of that cloud was actually a basic Hollow, Gillian, Adjuchas, Vasto Lorde, or Arrancar. There were so many of them, they might just have been almost every Hollow left in existence. Aizen\u2019s entire army. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold them off.\u201d Aizen commanded, his voice seemingly reaching every member of his army. \u201cThe King\u2019s Key should be complete in ten minutes.\u201d With that said, Aizen seemed to disappear into the depths of the Hollow cloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, you ready to crush some bugs, Snowy?\u201d Jinta asked as he cracked his knuckles in anticipation. For once, Toshiro actually agreed with Jinta\u2019s course of action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf they\u2019re just Hollows, I don\u2019t have any complaints.\u201d the turquoise eyed god replied, also cracking his knuckles. The Hollow army all gave their signature battle cry simultaneously as the two giants got into their fighting positions. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Jinta and Hitsugaya could so much as move, Aizen, within the huge cloud of Hollows, signaled a nearby Arrancar. The Arrancar was lean, with short spiky green hair. His hole was clean through his right foot and he was dressed in shorts and a tank top. The remains of his Hollow mask was three small chunks across his forehead, connected by thinner pieces, making it look like he was wearing a circlet of some kind. He nodded at Aizen and activated his special ability. Aizen had modified this Arrancar so that he had a very special power, namely, the ability to absorb other Hollows into his own being and gain their powers. With all of the Hollows currently surrounding him, it was sure to be an enormous boost. His whole body glowed red and the Hollows closest to him started moving towards his body. As soon as they touched they were absorbed, disappearing into the Arrancar. He grinned as he absorbed more and more, his body starting to grow in size and muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Arrancar slowly started his rise to power, Jinta was looking happily into the Hollow cloud. \"Okay Snowy here's how it's going to go! I'm going to take out all those Hollows in the upper right, right, and lower right corner! You can have the rest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya sighed and said, \"Wouldn't it make more sense just to each take half?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta snorted and said, \"No way! That's like cutting my fun in half!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a game! There's a lot at stake here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No duh Snowy! So just do what I say before I start laying the beat down on YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya growled in frustration but let the matter drop. He was about to approach the cloud when it suddenly disappeared in a flash of blinding red light. When it cleared, the cloud had been replaced by a massive Arrancar. He was so huge, Hitsugaya and Jinta only came up to his massive abs, his body no longer lean and athletic but ripped with muscle. His tank top had been shredded and his shorts were now more like speedos. He grinned and said, \"So you two are the ones causing Lord Aizen so much trouble? Don't make me laugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?\" Jinta shouted, surprised by this Arrancar's sudden appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arrancar shook his head and said, \"I've taken on all the other Hollows and Arrancars here. I no longer am a single entity. Just call me Legion, one from many!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya didn't like the looks of this. This Arrancar had far more power than anyone they had faced yet. Even the Infinity Corp seemed weak in comparison to this behemoth. Just what sorts of tricks were up his sleeve? Where was Aizen in all of this? He didn't have time to ponder these questions as Legion made his move. With movements quicker than could be followed, he picked Hitsugaya and Jinta up and lifted them up into the air, slamming them together repeatedly. \"Hah! Talk about pathetic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta growled and managed to kick Legion, hard, in the stomach. The Arrancar didn't even flinch. He tossed the two into the ground and jumped up, stomping on both of them. \"You're going to have to do better than that you weak little punks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could move he kicked them, sending them flying backward. Before they could hit the ground, he dashed ahead of them slammed his arms into their bodies, sending them down to the ground. He laughed wildly, elbowing Hitsugaya in the gut. He was fast...too fast! And so strong...they weren't ready for this level of skill and horror! Legion seemed to interpret every move they were going to make before they made it. As soon as Jinta raised a hand to try and use his gravity powers or open a hole in reality, Legion would attack him, grabbing his arm and twisting it, throwing him to the ground. While they were distracted, if Hitsugaya tried to attack from behind, Legion would dodge any attack thrown at him and slam his knee into Hitsugaya's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad. They were too divided in their attempts to attack him. They would need to band together if they wanted to stand any kind of a chance against him. For Ichigo, Renji, and Hisagi, it was torture trying to keep themselves from getting killed. Ichigo and Hisagi were clinging desperately to Jinta's shirt, their hands and arms sore from the effort, while Renji had grabbed onto Hitsugaya's hair and wasn't letting go, getting tossed about with every movement the massive captain made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is just too easy!\" Legion said with a laugh. \"How did you guys manage to survive this long? You must have been up against some really weak opponents!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Jinta shouted, wincing at his bruised body. \"I'm going to take you down, stomp that insect Aizen, and take over from god! And you're not going to stop me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegion looked amused. \"I'd like to see you try kid.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta had it with this guy. He only fought him for a couple minutes and he was already sick of him. No one was supposed to be bigger or stronger than him. NO ONE. There was only one way to correct this mistake: growth. Jinta would tap into his new growing ability and become the same size Hitsugaya was when he crushed the Infinity Corp. The evil red head started to concentrate, picturing himself bigger and everyone and stomping this Legion like an insect. He hadn\u2019t even grown a centimeter when Legion suddenly appeared in front of him and grasped his face, thrusting it into the ground. The giant Arrancar grinned cruelly as he squeezed Jinta\u2019s head like an orange, enjoying the boy\u2019s squirming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya took this chance to form an ice sword in his hand and swing at Legion\u2019s arm. The spiky haired man caught Hitsugaya\u2019s blade with his other hand. He smirked at the white head as his hand began to glow red hot. The ice sword started to melt rapidly until it was just a harmless puddle on the ground. Before Hitsugaya could understand what had happened, Legion slugged the teen in the face with the same burning hand. Toshiro went flying backwards, landing on top of a few mountains. Legion smiled as he watched the \u201cgod\u201d writhe in pain as he clutched his burned cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I forget to mention? All those Hollows I absorbed didn\u2019t just increase my basic powers; I also got a shit load of new abilities too!\u201d Legion explained with glee before picking Jinta off of the ground and tossing him away like a rag doll\u2026right into Hitsugaya (who had managed to wobble to his feet a few seconds earlier). Both teenaged titans were collapsed on the ground on top of one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamnit, Snowy! Don\u2019t get in my way!\u201d Jinta yelled as he got to his feet and glared down at the ex-captain. Hitsugaya glared back at Jinta, his face still searing with pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t working, Jinta! We have to work together to beat this abomination!\u201d Toshiro tried to explain, but the other giant just pushed him aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWork with a false god like you? Forget it! Just sit back and watch me fight this creep myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you do that, you\u2019ll <b>die</b>!\u201d Hitsugaya snapped back, raising his voice to such a level that Jinta probably would of slugged his incompetent slave for the outburst of they were somewhere else. \u201cDid the last encounter with Aizen teach you anything?! If you underestimate your opponent, you\u2019ll get killed. Is that what you want? To be stomped into the dirt and spat on, never becoming God like you wanted?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait\u2026what am I saying? I don\u2019t want him to become God! I want to prevent that!</i> Hitsugaya thought to himself. He remembered, however, that these were just words. All he needed right now was to get Jinta to work alongside him so he could live to undo this entire mess. He could still stop the brat once Aizen was stopped first. To do that, Hitsugaya would say and do anything, even get on his knees and beg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky, he didn\u2019t need to go that far. His words were already having an effect on the red headed teen, even though his face showed otherwise. Jinta\u2019s head started to fill with the memories of his encounter with the clones. Memories he never wanted to happen again, but just might if this oversized Arrancar won. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026I\u2019ll cooperate with you, but just this once! After this guy is beaten, you\u2019re going back to serving me!\u201d Jinta said, pointing at his fellow giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, let\u2019s shake on it.\u201d Hitsugaya put his hand out for Jinta to shake. Jinta looked at the hand for a few moments before scoffing and quickly shaking it. No sooner had their hands touched that they both noticed a giant, multicolored Cero heading their way. The gods threw up a barrier of warped space to block the beam. The explosion from the Cero hid Legion, who broke through the barrier grasped Jinta around the throat. With one young god in his right hand, Legion used his left foot to stomp down on Hitsugaya\u2019s chest, forcing him to the ground. The giant, supreme Hollow smirked as he choked Jinta and grinded his heel into Toshiro\u2019s chest, making both boys groan in their suffering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to interrupt your little chat, but I just can\u2019t keep away from your delicious spiritual energy. I know Lord Aizen told me to hold you off, but I think I\u2019ll just kill you both and feast on your souls. Forget ten minutes, this won\u2019t even take ten seconds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegion was about to put all his strength into crushing Jinta\u2019s throat when he suddenly lost feeling in his left leg. Toshiro had tore open a spatial rip through his leg, separating it at the knee. The Arrancar hollered in pain as he released Jinta and collapsed to the ground. Both teens retreated back just as the bone, muscle, and skin of Legion\u2019s lost leg reappeared. The regeneration was even faster than Grimmjow\u2019s\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky shot, punks.\u201d Legion muttered as he got back to his feet and prepared for another assault on the duo. Jinta and Hitsugaya glanced at each other, both nodding before taking off in different directions. Legion followed them with his eyes and smirked amusingly. \u201cSeparating, eh? Doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019ll just tear you apart one at a time!\u201d Legion chose Toshiro as his first target and rushed for the white haired titan. The former 10th Division captain didn\u2019t have enough time to react. Luckily, he didn\u2019t need to. A portal appeared in Legion\u2019s path just before he reached Hitsugaya. The Arrancar came out another portal and slammed face-first into Jinta\u2019s mighty fist. Legion cried out again as he stumbled back, clutching his broken nose which quickly healed. When he looked up again, he noticed both giants were starting to enlarge themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no you don\u2019t!\u201d the green-haired man shouted before pointing one hand at each of the teens, releasing a double Cero on them from each palm; without even needing to charge first. The boys stopped their growth and dove out of the way, avoiding the powerful laser in the nick of time. Their growth had left their height up to Legion\u2019s chest now. Legion decided it was time to take them both out in a single attack\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, punks, try and dodge this!\u201d Legion clapped his hands together, as if praying, and slowly separated them. A small orb of pure energy formed between his hands, and the further the hands got from each other, the smaller the orb got. The sphere continued to compress until it was just a tiny twinkle to the titans. Legion\u2019s smirk widened as he flicked the twinkle at Jinta. The red head watched the small light slowly make its way toward him until it was directly in front of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is this puny thing going to do?\u201d Jinta laughed, mocking the Arrancar\u2019s attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJinta! Get out of there, now!\u201d Hitsugaya shouted, making Jinta glance over at him with a puzzled expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOOOOOOM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small spark of light exploded with devastating power, tearing the ground asunder. A giant pillar of light shot into the sky, climbing so high that it passed Earth\u2019s orbit. Legion watched, laughing manically, as his attack destroyed everything in the vicinity. When the pillar shrank and vanished as quickly as it came, the spot the three titans were formerly fighting in was revealed to be reduced to a large crater several miles deep. Legion stepped over to the edge of the crater and peered down, seeing something surprising: the two gods\u2019 corpses. They were intact, but heavily damaged. Both of them were missing a few limbs and one was even missing half their face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, your bodies were made from tough stuff. Hope your spiritual energy is still fresh.\u201d Legion licked his lips as he descended into the crater. As he approached the bodies, the face of Hitsugaya\u2019s corpse suddenly cracked. Legion raised an eyebrow just before the corpses turned to ice and shattered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the-?\u201d Legion didn\u2019t finish, as the real Jinta appeared above him and slammed into his back. with the oversized Arrancar on the ground, Jinta raised his foot and slammed it down on him, breaking his back in several places. The titanic Hollow bellowed in pain once more, and Jinta kept his foot firmly pressed into his back so he couldn\u2019t heal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stupid bug! You can\u2019t kill us with a flash light show!\u201d Jinta said just before hopping off the Arrancar. Legion rolled over on his back and saw a giant sphere of solid ice floating above him. Toshiro smirked down at him and let the sphere fall. Legion managed to scream a single note before the round object came down on him with a loud crash. Jinta and Hitsugaya walked next to each other and grinned at their work. It wasn\u2019t over yet, though\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice sphere started to glow red right before a pillar of red hot flames erupted out of the crater like a volcano. He sphere of ice was disintegrated and out of the fiery tower came Legion\u2026a very pissed off Legion. His eyes glowed bright red and his body seemed to be covered in flames. Legion howled in anger before rushing at the two smaller giants. Neither was able to react in time and Legion slammed both his searing hot fists into their stomachs. He grinned evilly at the two stupid \u201cgods\u201d\u2026but something was wrong. His fists were buried in their guts, but neither of them were showing as much pain as they should. His fists should have burned right through them! Looking down, Legion realized the problem; both teens\u2019 midsections were enwrapped with ice. Son of a\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady?\u201d Jinta asked Toshiro. \u201cOn the count of thee. One\u2026two\u2026three!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giants pulled Legion closer to them and head butted him at the same time. Legion\u2019s skull was fractured and a good amount of his mask fragments were destroyed. Legion staggered back, leaving himself open for Hitsugaya to tackle him to the ground. As the Arrancar\u2019s forehead healed, Hitsugaya bound the man to the ground by freezing his hands and legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! You think this can hold me? Na\u00efve fools!\u201d Legion said as he started to heat up his body. No matter how hot his skin got, however, the ice would not melt. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why won\u2019t this ice melt?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is.\u201d Hitsugaya replied, his hands outreached and pointing at Legion. \u201cI\u2019m just regenerating the ice at a rapid rate so you can\u2019t melt it fast enough!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamnit!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta approached Toshiro, holding his bleeding head and bruised stomach. \u201cDamn this guy! He ruined another one of my shirts!\u201d Jinta complained as he removed his hand, revealing a big hole burned into his shirt which made his abs visible underneath. Hitsugaya also sported similar damage to his own clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u2019s not the time for that! We have to hurry up and finish this guy, I can\u2019t keep this up forever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah. Let me just grow until I\u2019m big enough to squash this guy like an insect. He won\u2019t be able to regenerate from that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, just don\u2019t crush me along with him.\u201d Toshiro told the other giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t. What do you think I am, heartless?\u201d</span></div></div>",

He intended to grind this fool of a Hollow under his heel until there was nothing left! He hated  having his authority undermined, he hated his clothes getting ruined, he hated bugs who got to full of themselves and thought they could become gods, and, most of all, he hated getting hurt! Gods were not supposed to get hurt! He would make Legion pay for even THINKING of bruising his gorgeous body. He had to make sure Snow wasn't smashed though. He had been a lot of the things that Jinta hated, but he was now a loyal slave...sort of. A little conditioning and he'd be just as good as Ichigo and Hisagi...but he'd have to work to get into as high a position as they were in Jinta's eyes. Well...as high as a speck can get in a god's eyes anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Jinta was big enough to crush Legion underfoot but he didn't stop there. He kept on growing. He wanted to totally smash this Arrancar and the only way to do that was to make sure his godly foot was big enough to exert the force necessary to destroy his very molecules. His body stretched out in all directions, his massive feet on either side of the Arrancar and Soul Reaper. Legion, seeing Jinta's smirking face quickly disappearing high, high, HIGH above him, started panicking and struggling to free himself. Hitsugaya started sweating with the effort of holding the supreme Hollow in place. If Jinta didn't hurry up his prey would escape! Hitsugaya wanted to shout up at the god teen to just get on with it already but knew that yelling at him while he was this size would no doubt earn him a place next to Legion as a smear on the red head's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta stopped his growth when Hitsugaya and Legion were nothing but specks to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Snowy!\" his voice bellowed out over the landscape. \"Move aside and let me crush this wannabe god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya didn't need to be told twice. With a burst of energy he solidified the prison around Legion before escaping a good distance away. Legion immediately began heating up his body, the ice cracking and melting all around him but Jinta wasn't about to let the speck escape. He lifted his mammoth foot above the struggling Hollow and slowly brought it down. Legion could only stare up in horror as the massive flesh colored object descended from the sky on top of him. When the foot was mere feet away from obliterating him, he broke free from the ice, got to his feet, and held his arms above his head. Miraculously, he caught the foot and stopped its descent! Jinta frowned and forced more pressure on his foot, but Legion held fast, holding the god at bay. Jinta started getting annoyed and put all his weight on the foot. Legion was forced to lower the foot closer to his body, his arms shaking, but he still managed to hold Jinta off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You damn bug! Die already!\" Jinta started increasing his size again, forcing more weight and pressure on the Hollow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya watched nervously for a second before looking around for Aizen again. He was focused on creating the King's Key now and wouldn't be able to draw his sword. This was the best time to find him and crush him. Aizen was the last major threat to the world. Hitsugaya had confidence that he could stop Jinta. He still felt a pang of guilt at all this. Then he remembered Jinta's atrocities. It really was for the best. When this was all over Jinta would be punished but he'd make sure the punishment wasn't too severe. Jinta was a monster who had destroyed millions of lives but he was also a small boy. To him, the world was a toy to be played with or broken. From his immature perspective he didn't even believe what he was doing was wrong. It was really the slime that had had started this whole fiasco. Never again should such a weapon be available to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegion's arms started growing weaker and weaker. He was fighting a losing battle. Jinta could increase his size infinitely. Sooner or later, his foot would be coming down on the hollow. Jinta was totally unconcerned with the anything going on except crushing this Hollow into a pancake! He grunted and shoved and continued enlarging. Soon, the shadow of his foot was starting to cover Hitsugaya again! Hitsugaya looked up at the truly terrifying size of Jinta's foot, filling the sky above him, balanced on the single point of a stubborn Arrancar. The whole thing defied the laws of physics and reason but it was happening right before him! Perhaps the laws of the universe truly meant nothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya started increasing his own size, running to get out of the shadow of the god's foot. He was neck in neck with the edge of it when Legion's arms finally gave out, the bones snapping like dry twigs, allowing the foot to come crashing down on top of him. Hitsugaya dove at the last second and just managed to avoid getting crushed, the wind of the appendage's descent blowing him away. The force of Jinta landing decimated the already destroyed area, sending fissures out into areas of land that had, thus far, remained untouched. The Americans were witnessing destruction that blew the destruction Japan had faced out of the water. When Jinta was sure that Legion had been ground into nothing he sighed and fell back on his butt, the tremors creating even more devastation while his ass took out miles and miles of land. Jinta scratched his exposed abs and said, \"That was more work then it should have been...damn bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a squeaking sound filled his ears and he looked down between his legs. A teensy white speck was yelling at him...or something. Jinta could attune his hearing and understand what he was saying perfectly...but he wasn't about to get lectured by a speck. He rolled his eyes and said, \"I don't care what you're yelling about Snowy! I took care of it so just shut up! One more word out of you and YOU'LL be a stain under my foot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed his foot down next to Hitsugaya for emphasis. Hitsugaya, his temper cooling down after that display, looked up at Jinta and shouted, \"Fine! But shrink down so we can look for Aizen now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta looked around at the destruction and snickered, \"Hey! Maybe I already took him out.!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed at the idea of having taken out Aizen, who had been feared by so many, as a side note, as collateral while fighting someone else. The whole thing was too funny!</span></div></div>",

Aizen would have had to escape pretty far to avoid Jinta\u2019s colossal foot, so he would need to expand his search. Hitsugaya started walking around the area, pushing his senses outward to detect the faintest hint of the bastard\u2019s spiritual pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro couldn\u2019t sense Aizen\u2019s spiritual pressure anywhere. Did he already complete the key and make it into the Spirit King\u2019s realm? No\u2026they would have sensed that. \u201cThis\u2026can\u2019t be.\u201d Toshiro mumbled to himself, rejecting the idea that Aizen really had been just collateral damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, you mean I was right?!\u201d Jinta exclaimed when he saw Toshiro\u2019s dumbfounded face. \u201cOh\u2026wow\u2026I think\u2026I think I\u2019m gonna\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta fell onto his back, crushing even more of California, and started bellowing with uncontrollable laughter. He rolled around like some immature child, trying to keep his laughter in check\u2026and failing miserably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya ignored the tremors caused by Jinta\u2019s laughing fit. He was still trying to wrap his head around this. Aizen, the man who he had hated even more than Jinta. Aizen, the man who had betrayed Soul Society and was feared by everyone. Aizen, the man who always gloated and acted like he had already won before the fight started. He was crushed without either of them knowing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, snowball?\u201d Jinta asked, finally regaining his composure and sitting back up. \u201cAizen\u2019s kicked the bucket. I thought that\u2019d make you happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro was happy, somewhere behind his amazement. His only regrets being that he didn\u2019t see the look on the Soul Reaper\u2019s face right before he was crushed and the fact it wasn\u2019t HIS foot that had ended him. There was another reason why he wasn\u2019t as thrilled as he should be: this victory wasn\u2019t permanent. Aizen\u2019s death would need to be undone, just like everything else. Letting him stay dead would cause a number of problems Hitsugaya wouldn\u2019t even begin to try and comprehend. At least, when everything was back to normal, they would have a chance of beating Aizen with their own power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, whatever. The specks are gone.\u201d Hitsugaya heard Jinta say. He turned around to see Jinta starting to shrink back down to his \u201cnormal\u201d size. The teen was stretching his sore muscles as he shrank. \u201c\u2026hey, speaking of specks.\u201d Jinta glanced down at his shoulder. \u201cHey, carrot top and 69 face, you two still alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo and Hisagi were both slumped over Jinta\u2019s shoulder, beat red and with very sore arms from having held on to Jinta\u2019s t-shirt for so long. They were still conscious, amazingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re fine, Lord Jinta!\u201d Ichigo shouted up to his master. \u201cWe never let go, not even for a second!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were amazing, Lord Jinta! They way you worked so well with Hitsugaya\u2026and the unbelievable size you grew to\u2026your powers are limitless, master!\u201d Hisagi praised, making Jinta grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap, Renji!\u201d Toshiro dug into his hair and fished out the red head. When he plucked him out, the small man looked as worn out as Jinta\u2019s slaves did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m okay, Captain. Did you beat him?\u201d Renji asked, having not seen the entire fight from within the boy\u2019s hair. It was a good thing too; the sight of his worst enemy and his friend working side-by-side probably would of made him sick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, time\u2019s a wasting! Time to take God\u2019s throne!\u201d Jinta shouted as he started to rip a hole in reality connecting to the Spirit King\u2019s realm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a sec!\u201d Hitsugaya shouted after Jinta, making the red haired menace stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?! Aizen\u2019s dead, what more reason do I need to stay here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026it\u2019s just that, are you sure that\u2019s a good idea? I doubt you\u2019re going to let the Spirit King just hand his throne over to you, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not! I\u2019m going to challenge him for it. I won\u2019t accept myself as the Spirit King until I turn the old one into a sniveling bug at my feet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you think you can do that in our condition?\u201d Hitsugaya pointed at Jinta\u2019s bruised and battered body. The red head examined himself and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point\u2026I guess I may as well rest up for the fight. These wounds will heal by tomorrow, I guarantee it!\u201d Jinta decided before waving his hand over his stomach, repairing the ruined shirt in a flash. Hitsugaya did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, how about we find someplace to sleep. Preferably someplace away from any people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you, my mom? I\u2019ll sleep whenever and wherever I want.\u201d Jinta spat at Toshiro, walking off to examine the surroundings. Hitsugaya rolled his eyes and placed Renji on his shoulder. The older man suddenly spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is our chance, Captain! He\u2019s weakened from the fight with that Arrancar.\u201d Abarai stated, growing impatient with this little charade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet. In case you didn\u2019t notice, I\u2019m not at 100% either. Plus, I\u2019d feel a lot better once your powers finally awaken.\u201d the white haired teen explained to his speck-sized comrade. Renji just sighed and sat down, looking displeased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jinta looked around, he came across the crater Legion had made using his little sparkle attack. Jinta\u2019s crushing of the land had filled the crater with debris, but one gravity power later and the crater was once again empty and even a little wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Snowy, I think I just came up with a way to use your powers efficiently!\u201d Jinta called the false god over to him as he directed his attention to the crater. \u201cThe bottom of this crater is really hot; there must be an underground volcano around here somewhere. If you were to toss a big chunk of ice in here, it\u2019ll melt and turn into a nice hot bath!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Hitsugaya inquired, shocked. His powers were the only reason hey had managed to escape that battle with their lives, and now this brat wanted him to make a hot bath for him? \u201cWhy do you need to bathe? You can just remove the dirt off yourself with your abilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s nothing like a nice hot bath to ease the body. You can even join me, if you want. It\u2019ll help comfort our wounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya hated the idea of using his powers for such a meager purpose, but it was hard to refuse. For once, Jinta was speaking logically. A nice hot soak would feel nice after that fight\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hitsugaya hesitated before sighing and holding his hand out. A huge chunk of ice appeared in the air and fell down into the crater. A sharp hissing noise filled the air and the ice instantly began melting. Renji yelled out, \"Captain, what are you doing?!? You can't take a bath with that kid! This isn't the time to be fooling around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, Hitsugaya was sick of Renji's constant complaining. He sighed and said, \"You didn't just spend the last eight minutes getting beaten black and blue. I'm need some time to relax and heal so just deal with it alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji heard the weariness, and annoyance, in the young giant's voice so he merely sat down, crossed his arms, and stayed silent. Jinta rubbed his hands together excitedly as he watched the ice melt, steam rising up from the crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work Snowy! Took a little longer than I liked but we'll work on that...or not. When I'm God I'll be taking away your powers. But hey! At least you get to be one of the personal slaves of God! That's a pretty good deal I think, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed loudly and took off his shirt. Hitsugaya ignored the comment and added a bit more ice to the crater, filling it up so that the water was just about overflowing. Hitsugaya was too tired to even think about answering Jinta's jeers. He didn't know where the boy turned teen even got all of his energy. He never seemed to be tired and was constantly moving about, laughing and talking. He looked up at the boy and as shocked to see he was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! Put something on! You can't go in there naked!\" Hitsugaya sputtered, his face turning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta raised an eyebrow at him and said, \"What's your problem Snowy? Don't like my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned and started flexing, his muscles jumping up impressively. He was quite muscular thanks to the slime enhancing his body to near perfection. When he got the Spirit King's powers, and surpassed them, he'd be even more perfect. He walked over and slung his arm around Hitsugaya's neck, nearly crushing Renji. \"Listen Snowy, you gotta get over these feelings of modesty. Look at us! We're giant gods! Well...a giant god and a slave to god who just happens to be a giant, but you get my point. Who cares if anyone sees us? Besides we look awesome! Here, let's get a look at your body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta instantly starting stripping Hitsugaya of his clothes. The young captain struggled, trying to stop Jinta from disrobing him but the boy was stronger than he was. Hitsugaya hadn't noticed it before, but the red head's muscles were bigger than his own and he was slightly taller. Hitsugaya finally let him strip him naked because it was better than having his clothes torn off. Jinta looked Hitsugaya over and said, \"Not bad Snowy. Not like ME of course, but who is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta laughed again, his hands on his hips, his chest muscles shaking with the laughter. He then sat down at the edge of the water and stuck his legs in. It was hot, but not unpleasantly so. He slid his body in, sighing in contentment as the hot water soothed his wounds and bruises, his aching body relaxing. Ichigo and Hisagi, who were on his shoulders still, which were above the water, watched their god relax happily. Jinta cocked an eye down at them and said, \"You two be careful. This water might not be hot enough to hurt me but it'll boil you two alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded and said, \"I wouldn't dream of relaxing in your bath without your permission Lord Jinta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not our place!\" Hisagi agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta nodded and said, \"Good.\" He looked up at Hitsugaya who was looking at him in embarrassment. \"Stop standing there and get in! I'm losing my patience with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya slowly eased himself in opposite Jinta and sighed as he felt the hot water caress his aching body. Jinta smirked and said, \"See? Doesn't that feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya nodded and closed his eyes, relaxing up to his neck. He had placed Renji on his clothes before getting in so he wasn't in any danger of getting cooked alive like a lobster. The two teens stayed silent for a moment, relaxing in the tub, just letting their aches and pains get eased away. It was the first time in the last few days either one could relax totally. There was absolutely no threats left to the world...except Jinta. Maybe it was better to say that Jinta was the most relaxed he had been in days. Hitsugaya, while relaxed, still had the looming threat of Jinta hanging over him. If Jinta took down the Spirit King he would be God. Nothing could ever hope to touch him. The only thing that would be capable of challenging him would be Hitsugaya and Renji and Jinta planned on taking them down either before he became God or first thing he did after he became God. Either way their lives were in danger...unless of course they just...submitted to Jinta. Hitsugaya shook his head. No! That was idiotic! He couldn't do that! He had to stop him! Still, there was a niggling little doubt in the back of his mind that basically said, \"Hey, if you help him out you'll live! If you oppose him, he might just kill you. What's it going to be? Guaranteed life? Or only the CHANCE at life?\" Needless to say, he was ignoring that voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta stared up at the sky and said, \"Looks like it's already getting dark. Man, what a day this has been. I gotta say, I'm going to miss this struggle to the top. It's been great dominating the world piece by piece. But, when I'm God, I'll be able to just resurrect and kill these specks as much as I want! Not to mention I'll have a whole universe to dominate! Man, I can't wait to take out the Spirit King!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya felt his resolve strengthen hearing this spiel. He HAD to stop Jinta or the whole universe would be nothing more than his plaything. He couldn't allow that. The question was: When should he finish the kid off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta snapped his fingers and said, \"Hey Snowy! Are you listening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya broke out of his thoughts and said, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta looked angry as he said, \"I SAID after I'm done taking out the Spirit King tomorrow morning I'll come get you and the moocher and you can start worshiping me to prove your worth. You not listening to me isn't a great start for you you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya frowned and said, \"Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta moved closer and said, \"Sorry...WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya grit his teeth and muttered, \"LORD Jinta...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta smirked and patted Hitsugaya on the head. \"That's right. Good Snowy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya wanted to tear the red head's freaking arm off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two gods relaxed in the bath for about an hour. Most of that hour, neither giant spoke and just focused on the warm water caressing their bare skin. They were so relaxed that if anyone stumbled upon them (not likely, since Jinta had wiped out every living thing for miles), they might think the duo were fast asleep. Ichigo and Hisagi, while not in the water itself, were also relaxing. The steam rising from the crater felt really good and the two slaves wanted to whip off their clothes and just bake on Jinta\u2019s smooth shoulder. That would have been disrespectful, however\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmhh\u201d Jinta sighed as he stretched his arms toward the sky. Hitsugaya, who had been in a relaxed state until now, was thrown back into reality upon hearing Jinta\u2019s detestable voice. \u201cThat felt great! Time to get some sleep, Snowy. I don\u2019t want to be half-asleep when I\u2019m forcing God to lick my soles.\u201d Jinta gripped the side of the crater with his hands and, using his powerful upper body strength, hoisted himself out of the water with little effort. Hitsugaya caught himself staring at the red head\u2019s muscular torso and legs as they glistened in their wetness. He blushed and turned his head before Jinta noticed him. \u201cYou getting out, Snowy? Hurry up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter climbing out, the two gods used their powers to collect all the water from their bodies and slipped back into their clothes. Jinta left his shirt off, claiming it was more comfortable and letting his slaves use it as a bed. Since they were in the middle of a wasteland, it would be pointless to search for a specific place to sleep. Hard ground was hard ground no matter how you look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning\u2026\u201d Toshiro muttered to his <i>master</i> as he set his eyes on a random spot to sleep on. Before he could take a single step, he felt Jinta\u2019s strong hand grasp his right shoulder and hold him in place. The Soul Reaper didn\u2019t turn around, but felt Jinta move closer to him until he was literally breathing down his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sleep with me tonight, Snowy?\u201d Jinta asked in a seductive voice, chuckling. Toshiro\u2019s face turned beat red and, as gently as possible, removed Jinta\u2019s hand from his shoulder and backed away. Was this brat seriously just a kid awhile ago? What had that slime done to him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be shy. I\u2019m a god and gods have specific needs. You\u2019re a slave, and slaves have the duty to fulfill those needs,\u201d Jinta looked over Toshiro\u2019s body and smiled. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll fulfill them quite nicely\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya was speechless. He couldn\u2019t want him to do\u2026<i>that</i> could he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack off, kid!\u201d Renji yelled, making Jinta glare at the small man. The glare was enough to make Renji back away for fear of being squashed. Jinta looked back at Toshiro and smirked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave you to your tiny boyfriend for tonight.\u201d Jinta joked as he turned around and walked slowly to his own chosen spot. \u201cIf you ever change your mind, I\u2019ll be right over here.\u201d Hitsugaya was left staring at Jinta\u2019s bare back as he walked away. That broad, muscular back. Toshiro just wanted to run over there and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArrg!\u201d Hitsugaya held his head as it ached. <i>What\u2019s happening to me?</i> he though to himself. <i>I can\u2019t be falling under his spell! I can\u2019t become a slave like Kurosaki and Hisagi! Not after what he did to Soul Society and all those innocent people.</i> Hitsugaya looked at his hands and noticed they were all sweaty and shaking. Something powerful was taking a hold of him. He was supposed to be a god just like Jinta, so why wasn\u2019t he immune to the monster\u2019s influence? Was he THAT intimidating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He killed everyone. Momo, Rangiku, Kira, everyone! All the Soul Reapers\u2026every one of them\u2026each and every petty, inferior, insignificant\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain Hitsugaya!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro gasped as he was tugged back into reality. His eyes fell upon his left shoulder, where Renji was standing and looking up at him with a worried expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright, Captain? You were shaking so much I almost fell off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry. I must be more tired than I thought after that battle. I\u2019m fine\u2026don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Hitsugaya laid himself down on his back and placed Renji on his chest. After telling the small man to get some sleep, Toshiro rested his head back and shut his eyes. Renji laid down as well and snuggled up in Hitsugaya\u2019s black kosode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Renji still couldn\u2019t fall asleep. Jinta was snoring so freaking loudly that it was just impossible. Were Ichigo and Hisagi able to sleep with this racket? The vice-captain tried looking up at the stars, but was met with the giant replica of Jinta\u2019s face replacing the moon. Sighing, the long haired Soul Reaper stood up and glanced over Hitsugaya. He had only been sleeping for a few hours, but it looked like his wounds were already closed up. Jinta\u2019s were probably the same, unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to get some sleep. I\u2019m sure the Captain will find me if I sleep elsewhere.\u201d Renji told himself before jumping off Toshiro\u2019s body, landing on the spirit particles in the air and taking off. He was literally running on air, so he was covering a lot more distance than normal. Despite this it still took over an hour to get far enough so Jinta\u2019s snoring couldn\u2019t be heard anymore. Renji sighed as he fell back to Earth and collapsed on the ground. Thanks to his fatigue, he probably would have fallen asleep in seconds\u2026if he wasn\u2019t snapped awake by a sudden rush of power coming from deep with in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vice-captain scrambled to his feet, now feeling like he had slept for an entire day. He looked at his hands and watched as his body was engulfed in a golden light. He grinned widely as the slime finally started working its magic and turned him into a god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time, you stupid slime! You better make the wait worth it!\u201d Renji shouted as he felt what seemed like limitless power course through his body. Slowly he started to do what he had been waiting days for: growing. Growing bigger and bigger; reaching the height fit for a god. Not wanting to wake his enemy up, Renji kept his growing spiritual pressure hidden (as apposed to Hitsugaya, who had let it flood out to get the Infinity Corp\u2019s attention). In under a minute, Renji had grown to a towering being of gold. Knowledge of his new powers filled his head and power like never before filled his muscles. The power he felt from his Bankai was nothing compared to this might!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the golden light faded, Renji was standing taller than even Jinta by a few inches. He looked over himself coiled his hands into fists. Fists that he was going to use to knock that brat\u2019s teeth out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is perfect! With this power, we\u2019ll finally be able to take that brat down!\u201d Renji grinned and looked in the direction he had come from. \u201cSorry, kid, but your journey to the top ends tonight! I\u2019m kicking you back down to Earth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji walked over to where Hitsugaya and Jinta were sleeping. To avoid waking anyone with his mighty footsteps, he walked on the spirit particles in the air. It was a lot more difficult that normal, as the spirit particles couldn\u2019t support his weight for more than a second. Nevertheless, the distance that had taken him an hour to transverse now only took him a few steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Renji, his perfect plan to get the jump on Jinta while he slept was propelled out the window when he discovered\u2026 </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Renji got closer to Jinta's slumbering form, his snoring now just the average noise of a teenager as opposed to the deafening cacophony it had been before, he noticed something seemed...off. Jinta's body appeared to be twice as thick as it was before, and horribly misshapen. A thrill of horror passed through Renji as he thought that, perhaps, this was a side effect of the slime that had taken much longer to manifest than anything else. As he got even closer though he realized this was not the case although it did nothing to curb his horror and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya was laying on top of Jinta, his arms wrapped around the bigger, stronger red head, his face showing nothing but total submission and devotion. Jinta smirked at him as he loomed over the white haired giant's body, his big hands roaming over the smooth, pristine body. Both teens were naked and both were hard as a rock. Renji quickly hid himself behind a large pile of debris that had once been a mountain and masked his spiritual pressure totally. He didn't want to be seen right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...took you forever to come over to my side Snowy.\" Jinta said, leaning down and biting the Soul Reaper's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya hissed in a breath and said, \"P-please...not there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta laughed and bit in the same spot, Hitsugaya's face flushing. \"Sooner or later everyone who spends enough time with me comes to my side. You're getting major points for being able to get intimate with me like this. But I'm still pissed you've got the same powers as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya looked worriedly up at Jinta and said, \"Lord Jinta...if I could I would get rid of this slime in an instant so that I could join the other two living on your body. It is my place as a slave to a god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta nodded and said, \"All in good time Snowy. Once I'm God I'll blast that slime out of you and you'll be able to worship me like the speck you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya smiled and said, \"That sounds amazing Lord Jinta. You'll surely have no trouble removing the Spirit King from his throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji wanted to puke. Talk about disgusting! Captain Hitsugaya had always been so clean cut and proper. To hear him talking like this...to see him DOING things like this...it was beyond weird and ultimately cringe worthy. Luckily Renji still had a chance to sneak up on the brat. Once he was done doing his thing with Captain Hitsugaya he'd be worn out, tired, out of breath...if Renji were to attack at that moment he would be able to beat the crap out of the kid before he knew what hit him. So until then, he just would have to endure this display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta had locked lips with Hitsugaya and was dominating him with his powerful tongue. The smaller, weaker Soul Reaper could only cling to Jinta's body like a needy child and get swept away. Jinta licked his fingers and whispered, \"Alright Snowy...I'm going in. Get ready for your god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further warning Jinta shoved his fingers into Hitsugaya's virgin hole, stretching it as he pushed his way in. Hitsugaya covered his mouth and whimpered, wanting to scream out at the strong fingers probing his insides. He had to contain to himself...he didn't want to wake up the others. After feeling around inside for awhile, slowly stretching it out as much he could he pulled his fingers out and positioned his dick at the hole. Slowly, he pushed his way in, slowly, slowly, until his entire length was inside Hitsugaya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Hitsugaya, it felt like getting split in half. His whole body was on fire and the pleasure was shot through with moments of pain. He winced and whimpered, struggling before Jinta's strong body forced him to be still, his hips slowly bucking. This was the first time for both of them so the movements were slow and clunky but still burned with the pleasure of sexual desire. Jinta saw Hitsugaya's fingers tremble and they slowly lowered from his mouth. To prevent the smaller male from screaming out in either pleasure or pain he forced their mouths together, his tongue once again entering the willing mouth, licking at the teeth and pushing Hitsugaya's tongue back. Pre started leaking out of his slit, allowing a smoother entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji plugged his ears, trying to drown out the primal grunts and moans as well as the gasps and whimpers. This was so far from being right it looped back on itself. They were supposed to stopping this monster of a kid not pleasuring him! Renji shuddered as he thought of himself in this situation. That's the last thing he wanted...but would he, too, succumb to Jinta? It was already hard being around him while he was so much bigger than him and now he could see just how spectacular the kid...no, the teen looked and he felt his heart rate starting to increase just thinking about him and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji mentally shook himself. What the hell was he thinking?!? Was one of this kid's powers some kind of super seduction? Whatever it was he needed to keep a clear head if he was going to take him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta suddenly moaned loudly and increased his thrusting. He was getting closer to climax. Hitsugaya arched his back, his sphincter closing even more tightly around Jinta's throbbing cock as he choked and whimpered more, tears clearly standing out in his eyes. Jinta suddenly grunted, \"Relax Snowy! It's almost over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the noises Hitsugaya was making he was clearly enjoying what was happening as his cock suddenly spewed forth a volley of cum, splattering over Jinta's abs and chest, dripping back down on his own body. That seemed to send Jinta over the edge as his body tightened and he released his seed deep inside Hitsugaya. He sighed and collapsed on top of the white haired teen, kissing him. \"Good work Snowy. Your god is pleased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji knew that this was it. It was now or never.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After kissing Hitsugaya, Jinta sat up for a moment to get another look at his equal-turned-bitch. If you don\u2019t count the Infinity Corp (Couldn\u2019t that be considered self pleasure?}, this was his first time. Not so bad for God\u2019s first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to remove those powers from you and turn you into another speck on my body.\u201d Jinta said as he pictured the weaker giant becoming even weaker and clinging to his massive body while kissing it with affection. \u201cHowever, I might occasionally make you big again so we can do this another time.\u201d Jinta leaned down and kissed Toshiro on the forehead. The white haired slave smiled at his god, displaying a face that showed he\u2019d like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t get the chance, you little shit!\u201d Renji muttered under his breath before diving out from behind the mountain and dashing toward Jinta at his fastest speed. As soon as he made his move, a sly smirk spread across Jinta\u2019s face. Renji noticed this expression\u2026just as he ran into an invisible wall. The newest god slammed into it so hard that he was flung backwards, his back hitting another invisible wall. These two impacts caused the walls to ripple for a moment, revealing that they were part of some kind of cube formed around Renji. It was a barrier created from warped space\u2026when had Jinta set it up?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta bellowed with laugher as he witnessed Renji fall face-first into his trap. Hitsugaya looked in Renji\u2019s direction, his eyes full of pity for the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stupid, stupid moocher! Did you think I didn\u2019t notice you growing, or that you were listening to us? You think I\u2019m stupid or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I do!\u201d the vice-captain replied before starting to grow inside his prison. He continued to grow until his body began to press against the walls of the invisible cube\u2026in which the growing came to a halt. Renji groaned in pain as the walls wouldn\u2019t budge, not matter how much he grew. Eventually he was forced to shrink back down to avoid being permanently squashed into the shape of a cube. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why can I break out of here? I\u2019m supposed to be a god now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTough luck, moocher. That barrier was made with both Snowy\u2019s and my power. A single \u201cgod\u201d like you won\u2019t be able to break it easily.\u201d Jinta explained to the false god as he picked himself off Toshiro. As he got up, he almost lost his balance and fell back down again. Sex had made him disoriented and short of breath. If it wasn\u2019t for his damn barrier, Renji would have been able to charge the punk and beat the living shit out of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to prove Jinta wrong, Renji began using his new powers against the barrier. He pelted it with blasts of gravity, but nothing seemed to happen. He began throwing volleys of energy blasts at it, something neither Jinta or Hitsugaya appeared to be able to do (Although that didn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t.). Jinta just watched Renji blast away at the barrier until he used up so much energy that he had to sit down and rest. Jinta laughed at the poor performance and began walking toward Renji, something that was really difficult in his current, drowsy state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou finished, bug? No, I bet you\u2019ll keep doing that all night, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I will! It may not seem like it, but I know this barrier is slowly weakening! I\u2019ll break out of here and smash your smug face in!!\u201d Renji shouted at Jinta, making the teen even more amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you probably will break out if given enough time. But, you know what?\u201d Jinta leaned in closer to Renji, so close that if there wasn\u2019t a barrier separating them Renji would of punched the brat right in the nose. \u201cBefore you do break out, I\u2019ll have gotten a good night\u2019s sleep and be ready to deal with you. By all means, keep blasting away at that barrier. I\u2019ll be sleeping with your former captain\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta chuckled loudly and walked back to Hitsugaya. Renji slammed on the barrier walls and yelled more threats at Jinta, but the red haired deity didn\u2019t seem to be listening. Jinta laid down next to Toshiro and gathered the former captain in his strong arms. Hitsugaya snuggled into his master\u2019s buff chest and before long they were both asleep. It wasn\u2019t a peaceful sleep between lovers, though. As soon as Jinta fell asleep, he began snoring obnoxiously again. It wasn\u2019t as bad as when Renji was normal sized, but it was still terrible. He would have to listen to this all night! The Soul Reaper just urged himself to ignore the sound and continue attacking his prison. He attacked it with all his might, hour after hour. Every now and then he would need to rest for a few minutes to gather his strength back. A few hours later, the sun had risen over America and lit up the deserted wasteland. The barrier was no longer as perfect as it once was, now covered in cracks from Renji\u2019s relentless assault. It wouldn\u2019t be long now\u2026just a little more and he\u2019d be free. Unfortunately, the yawning of a certain nude god told him that his time was running out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last time I\u2019m sleeping on the ground.\u201c Jinta complained as he stretched his arms high into the sky and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. The red head looked down at his sleeping partner and began shaking him awake. \u201cRise and shine, Snowy! Today\u2019s the big day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya\u2019s eyes flickered open and a smile spread across his face as they were met with the eyes of his god. \u201cGood morning, Lord Jinta.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, Snowy.\u201d Jinta replied, giving Toshiro a quick kiss. \u201cYou ready to have those powers blown out of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait, Lord Jinta. I want to be weak and completely in your power.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll in due time\u2026\u201d Jinta rustled Hitsugaya hair as the two giants stood up and started getting dressed. Before putting his shirt back on, Jinta woke up Ichigo and Hisagi and placed them on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Lord Jinta!\u201d they both shouted at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two slept like a couple of logs last night. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t wake up.\u201d Jinta said as he pulled his white shirt over his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? Did something happen last night?\u201d Ichigo asked, glancing around. His eyes fell upon the giant Renji nearby. \u201cWh-what the-? When did you grow, Renji? And why are you trapped like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s imprisoned because he tried to attack Lord Jinta.\u201d Hitsugaya replied, bringing another shocked face to Ichigo upon saying \u201cLord Jinta\u201d. How much had they missed last night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got that right!\u201d Jinta grinned widely, no longer drowsy and full of energy. \u201cAnd you know what happens to false gods that dare to go against me.\u201d Jinta cracked his knuckles and approached Renji. His three slaves knew what he was intending to do, but they didn\u2019t seem to care. Their god was so close to his final ascension; anyone who got in his way at this point needed to be dealt with swiftly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain, you have to snap out of it!\u201d Renji screamed at Hitsugaya, who just stared at him blankly. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to return everything to normal? Don\u2019t you want to go back to how things used to be before this monster came into existence?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was a fool to want that.\u201d Hitsugaya replied. \u201cOur old life was meaningless. We were ruled by a king who never showed his face. He were all probably going to be killed by Aizen. Now, Aizen is dead and Lord Jinta is going to be our king. He\u2019s going to be the god that rules over all the pathetic insects like ourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHitsugaya\u2026he\u2019s going to kill me. Don\u2019t you care at all?\u201d Renji was on the brink of tears. After all that time they had spent together plotting against Jinta, he was now being betrayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Abarai.\u201d Hitsugaya shrugged. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have gone against the will of Lord Jinta. You brought this upon yourself\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHear that, moocher?\u201d Jinta cackled evilly as he smirked at the trapped Soul Reaper. \u201cYou\u2019re all alone now. Only thing left to do now is become my energy pill before the big showdown!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you just say?!\u201d Renji yelled in shock. Energy pill? He didn\u2019t mean\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, insect! All that talk about taking me down and teaching me a lesson while waiting for that slime to activate; in the end you\u2019re just going to be my pre-fight vitamin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Jinta started to enlarge himself before Renji. The betrayed Soul Reaper watched in horror as his worst enemy became bigger and bigger, all while grinning sadistically down at him. The red haired vice-captain shook his head and snapped himself out of the trance. This wasn\u2019t the time to be paralyzed with fear. He had to break out of this barrier! If he managed to do that, he may still have a chance. He didn\u2019t survive this long just to end up helping the brat in his conquest for power! Renji gathered up as much of his godly power as he could and forced it against the barrier in a massive telekinetic wave. The barrier rippled and cracked some more. Renji did the same thing a second time, watching the barrier slowly begin to collapse under the pressure. Each one of these blasts held enough power to level an entire city. Would Renji be able to destroy the barrier before it was too late?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Watching Renji struggle, Jinta just laughed and laughed, stretching higher and higher into the sky. It was so amusing watching the pathetic insect struggle in fear for his life. The situation was just so perfect. Renji had waited, and schemed, and slowly endured, all in the hopes of getting enough power to smash Jinta into the ground...and now he was totally helpless, a \"god\" for the space of a night, now reduced to a bug once again. In a few more seconds, Jinta would reach the perfect size for tossing the incompetent moocher in his mouth and swallow him whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jinta's shadow proceeded to cover him completely, his massive feet rising up on either side of him, Renji continued to force his power against the barrier. But Jinta and Hitsugaya had built it strong. There were many layers, each one set uniquely in a different position. He was forced to break it down, layer by layer, which was taking far too long. He had made progress but there was no way he'd be able to escape. Renji refused to just give in and lie down though. No matter how futile it was he wanted to go down fighting. He refused to give Jinta the satisfaction of him giving up and pleading. Renji glanced to the left and saw that Jinta's big toe was wiggling unconcernedly next to his prison, the slight movement creating a powerful \"BOOM\" sound that shook the ground. The massive digit rose above him like a monolith. His prison was effectively pill sized next to the gigantic teen. This was it. He increased his efforts, shattering another layer...but there was many more to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta grinned and reached down, lifting the prison up between his enormous fore finger and thumb. Renji watched as Jinta's muscular body rose slowly in front of him, passing by his towering legs, his massive organ that put any man to shame, his ripped abs, his bulging arms, his pumped chest, and, finally, to his grinning face. Renji felt his knees go weak and, despite his best efforts saying he wouldn't, he gave up and stared helplessly into those cruel, cold, and sadistic eyes that were clearly enjoying every second of this. Jinta turned the prison over a few times, looking in at Renji from every angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow moocher. After all that effort to attempt to reach my level, you ended up right back where you started. Maybe if you had been a proper slave to me, like Snowy, you wouldn't be in this position. But when I digest you, your slime will become mine and I'll have a nice little power boost for when I make the Spirit King lick my soles. So, hey, maybe you were good for something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bellowed laughter as he said this, the prison shaking from the force of his voice. Hitsugaya, not much more than a bug himself, watched from the foot of his god. He had climbed on top of it to avoid being crushed when Jinta had started growing (though Jinta knew he was there and wouldn't have crushed one of his slaves) and was now watching the events unfold with a smile on his face. He was totally complacent in watching his former comrade get eaten alive like a candy. He knew it was all for the good of Lord Jinta and his ascension. He was proud that he was going to be able to witness it. Ichigo and Hisagi, who were watching from Jinta's shoulder, were watching with the same devotion. Did they care a man they had called friend was about to be devoured by a egotistical kid on a power trip? Nope. No one would help, no one would feel bad. Renji was totally alone in his final moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well enough suspense building!\" Jinta said, patting his abs with one hand. \"I need me a morning snack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, Jinta tossed the prison into his mouth. Renji screamed as he was tossed onto the huge pink muscle, saliva dripping from all over the place,his teeth huge and glistening. Saliva pooled on the prison, small amounts of it plopping in on Renji through the cracks. Jinta swished the imprisoned slave around in his mouth and gulped, sending Renji tumbling down his gullet. The tight throat muscles massaged against the prison, pushing it down, down, down until Renji felt himself dropping into the stomach. He splashed into a puddle of...something and looked around in a daze. There was nothing in the stomach. The slime had turned Jinta's digestive system into an efficient machine, breaking down everything sent into the stomach to it's most basic construction, obliterating the waste and using the proteins and other chemical make ups to make him as big, healthy, and strong as possible. And that same process was now going to be put to work against Renji. Almost instantly the stomach was flooded with acid, dissolving the barrier in an instant and dropping Renji into the burning soup. Before he could so much as scream, he was submerged, the acids dissolving his clothes, then his flesh, until nothing was left but a skeleton which quickly dissolved as well. Soon, there was nothing left of the former Vice Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta sighed and patted his abs again. It felt so good to put an uppity bug in his place. He shrank himself back down to his base height and wrapped an arm around Hitsugaya, pulling him close. \"Alright Snowy! Time for me to put the Spirit King in his place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya smiled and held Jinta close, rubbing his face against the teen's pecs. \"I can't wait to see you destroy him, become God, and reduce me to my proper place. It shall be the greatest moment in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta laughed and said, \"That's the spirit! I'm glad I have at least three slaves who can get with the program and worship me as God! Now, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to open a portal to the Spirit King's realm when he felt a huge pressure building up inside his body. He groaned and bent over slightly, grabbing his stomach. Hitsugaya rubbed his back, a concerned look on his face. \"Lord Jinta! Are you alright? What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta panted a little, sweat beading on his forehead, but grinned. \"I'm fine Snowy...that wannabe god's slime is just finally bonding with me! I can feel my power growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said this, his spiritual pressure suddenly spiked upward, blowing Hitsugaya away, along with Ichigo and Hisagi. Luckily the two specks crashed against Hitsugaya, who gathered them in his hands as they watched Jinta change. His spiritual pressure climbed, higher and higher, the force of it pushing down on Hitsugaya, Ichigo, and Hisagi. Jinta laughed as he stood up, his body glowing, his muscles pulsing with power. He began to grow, his base height increasing, doubling. He climbed higher and higher into the sky, his feet encroaching on Hitsugaya. He crossed his arms, his muscles bulging larger, as he watched Hitsugaya get to his feet, moving backward to avoid getting crushed under his god's increasing feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Snowy! You're becoming a speck just like carrot top and sixty nine face!\" Jinta smirked as he said this, hands on his hips to better see the tiny Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya tripped as he moved backward, landing on his butt as the toes finally reached him. Luckily, he ended up between the big and second toe, avoiding getting crushed by his god. Finally, it seemed like Jinta's body had stopped growing. Jinta carefully pushed his toes apart and scooped up Hitsugaya onto on his finger. He raised the finger up to his eye and laughed to see the tiny Soul Reaper on top of it. \"Hey Snowy! Looks like you got your wish! Though I plan on making you even smaller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Hitsugaya, Jinta was god like, enormous and intimidating. To Ichigo and Hisagi...Jinta blew their minds. He was so fantastically large, so massively huge, that he defied comprehension to their tiny bodies. They were in total awe of him. They grinned into that eye and knew that their god was now only one step away from taking over the universe. Jinta set the bug and specks on his shoulder and opened a portal to the Spirit King's realm. He was ready to take his throne.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta couldn\u2019t wait any longer. As soon as the portal was big enough to accommodate for Jinta\u2019s massive size, the young god leaped through and waved Earth goodbye. The next time he saw it, he would be the \u201cGod\u201d so many of its inhabitants worshiped. He thought about all the things he could do to the planet once he was Spirit King. Since he could just recreate the planet indefinitely, any damage he caused to it didn\u2019t have to be permanent. These destructive thoughts, among others, kept Jinta amused the entire ten seconds it took to travel through the dimensional tunnel connecting to the Spirit King\u2019s realm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jinta exited the portal, his feet landed on something other than the elegant floor of the Spirit King\u2019s palace. Instead, it was a jagged and rocky surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs\u2026is this the Spirit King\u2019s realm?\u201d Hitsugaya asked as he looked around. This wasn\u2019t how Jinta remembered it. Instead of a gorgeous palace, Jinta now stood in the middle of some king of asteroid field. Each piece of space rock was large enough for the massive Jinta to stand on. In addition, several celestial bodies that Jinta didn\u2019t recognize could be seen in the distance. These planets were far closer to each other than they should be, however. It looked like they\u2019d crash into each other if they continued on their path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Spirit King! Come out! Don\u2019t tell me you died while I was gone!\u201d Jinta shouted out into the void-like realm. As if to respond to his voice, a lone asteroid floated into Jinta\u2019s line of sight. This asteroid carried a throne on it, and the Spirit King was seated on that throne. Jinta was happy, but not surprised, to see that the deity looked just like him again. Hitsugaya, who had never seen the Spirit King before, felt the urge to question why he looked the way he did. He didn\u2019t, though, as it didn\u2019t matter. This \u201cGod\u201d would soon feel the might of his one true god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou took your time in coming here.\u201d the Spirit King said, staring at Jinta emotionlessly. \u201cWhy did you not come here the moment you defeated Aizen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI felt like taking a little nap. I need to be at 100% when I beat you. Actually, I feel like I\u2019m at 200%!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. I have no intention of fighting you, only to give you the title of Spirit King.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I refuse your offer! I hate the idea of you looking down at me for even a second! I don\u2019t want the ultimate power handed to me, I want to reach out and grab it myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, that is not nece-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is necessary!\u201d Jinta clenched his fist and glared angrily at the Sprit King. \u201cI won\u2019t be satisfied in taking your throne until you\u2019re under my foot where you belong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026nothing I say will change your mind?\u201d the blue-haired Jinta asked, staring coldly at the red head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. I will give you the fight you desire. However, know this: If you fail to defeat me, I will absorb you into my body and use your spiritual energy to replenish my power. No matter what happens, there will be a Spirit King to sit upon the throne.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, why didn\u2019t you just absorb me from the start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been Spirit King for an unfathomable amount of time. Do you know how long it\u2019s been since the universe was formed? You have no way of possibly knowing how long I\u2019ve lived. I grow bored of it, and I would much prefer not to repeat this life again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want to die? Ha, I\u2019ll gladly grant your wish as the new God!\u201d Jinta cracked his knuckles and readied himself for the last showdown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think\u2026you can kill me?\u201d the supreme being asked as he stood up from his throne. Without lifting a finger, the asteroid he stood on collapsed under his massive spiritual pressure. The spiritual pressure was so powerful that it visibly cut at the walls of space. While Jinta\u2019s slaves could not stand under the pressure, Jinta just stood there with a big smirk. \u201cThen by all means, Jinta Hanakari, show me the power of the one who will become God!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spirit King gave a primal howl as a golden light engulfed his form. There was no one in the universe that didn\u2019t see this light, even if it was just a glint in the sky. Jinta quickly covered his slaves with his hand, for this light would have surely burnt out their eyeballs. Jinta himself had to throw up an arm to shield his eyes. He spotted the light start to expand and he jumped back to avoid being sucked into the golden figure. The asteroids and space debris seemed become a part of the slowly growing light. If Jinta didn\u2019t keep moving, he\u2019d lose this fight before it even started! When it appeared that he was running out of asteroids, Jinta opened a tear in reality and jumped through it. He reappeared a few miles from the expanding light and watched the last of the asteroid field get absorbed. By this time, the light started to fade and reveal the figure within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spirit King had revealed his true form to Jinta. A few things were different about the blue-haired deity now. First, his pupils were gone and his eyes were like white voids. Second, his hair was moving as if there was wind in this realm. Third, his long robes were gone and he was naked.  Despite having Jinta\u2019s form, his muscles were even bigger and more powerful than Jinta\u2019s. You could tell just by looking at him who would win an arm wrestling match. Finally, the most obvious difference was the Spirit King\u2019s size. He was\u2026huge. The only objects bigger than him now where the celestial bodies that existed in his realm\u2026and not by very much. Jinta, despite having just gone through a new growth spurt, was nothing but a fly to the Spirit King. The red haired god looked up at the current true God with his eyes wide and his mouth gaped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought\u2026I though you said you were weakening!?\u201d Jinta shouted up at the titan before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>I am. My current power output is only 30%.</b>\u201d the humongous creator stated calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be joking\u2026\u201d Jinta, who was standing on the spirit particles in the air, stepped back a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>It\u2019s not too late. You can still have my throne and we can avoid this battle.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget it! You don\u2019t scare me, pal!\u201d Jinta rooted his feet to the spot and glared up at the Spirit King. \u201cI don\u2019t care how big you get! I\u2019ll stomp you like any bug who thought they were bigger than me! My power is limitless!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Limitless? Do not be na\u00efve. Nothing in this universe is limitless. Even I, the Spirit King, have a limit. As the one who gave you the ability to grow, I know more than anyone that there is a limit to how much you can grow.</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s see who\u2019s right! I\u2019ll show you just how big the great Lord Jinta can get! I never needed your throne to be the most powerful being in existence! I just want the perks your power carries.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta gathered up all the strength he had and used it to fuel his growth ability. The Spirit King folded his arms across his chest and watched his chosen successor attempt to rise above him. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta was fuming. How dare this insignificant soon to be speck tell him he has limits? If he had believed that he had limits he would have been killed a long time ago! He would have been decimated by the army, crushed by Grimmjow, broken entirely by the Infinity Corps, fallen to Aizen, lost to Hitsugaya, get betrayed by Renji! In other words, if he had believed he had limits he wouldn't be where he was standing right now, powering himself up, getting ready for the mother of all growth spurts. He was going to show this would be god, this so called \"King\" and force him into submission! Anyone who dared have power that didn't immediately submit to him, that actually TOLD him he couldn't do whatever he wanted, had to be eradicated. Who needed this punk's power anyway? Jinta's was limitless! He would burst through the canopy of reality and create his own if he needed to! All of the power of the universe wouldn't stand up to him when he was done! This was it! The final moment of his ascension!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spirit King watched as Jinta clenched his fists, his spiritual pressure rising dramatically with every passing second. He sighed as he watched this ridiculous display. This child had been given a godliness that wasn't true, a man made power that someone had gotten drastically out of control. However, the Spirit King was willing to step down to this boy since the vacancy of Heaven needed to be filled. But now this? He would have to put this silly red haired child in his place and seek out another to take his place. Hitsugaya was the third strongest in the universe, perhaps he could be convinced to take the throne? He had recently had his mind broken by Jinta's will. With a little more prodding and convincing his mind might be turned toward doing what the Spirit Kind wanted. It was really his only option at this point. Jinta was too stubborn to merely take the throne when it was offered. The Spirit King turned to Jinta again and saw the boy was still gathering energy, preparing to try and outgrow him. How sad. This was getting to be almost embarrassing. To Jinta, this was an ultimate display of his soon to be superiority but to the Spirit King, it was merely a futile effort that would be snuffed out within seconds. The perspective between the two was devastating. He decided to let this charade continue for a few more minutes before he crushed Jinta. It was sad that all this time had been spent grooming this red haired maniac and now...for nothing. Oh well. There was still time, still options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Spirit King thought this, though, something strange happened. He knew that Jinta was reaching the threshold of his limits, that he would soon stop powering up and start growing, reaching only the size of his shin if he was lucky, but...he was still taking in vast amounts of power! His intake should have been slowing down but it was still as strong as ever! That was simply...impossible! The Spirit King's once inscrutable expression suddenly wavered. He wasn't used to this feeling of apprehension...for millenia he had ruled over the universe as the strongest being in existence! But now...now he was actually being challenged by another...whose power was exceeding the limits placed on him! For the first time in a long time...he was starting to feel fear. Jinta grinned as he felt so much power flooding his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! I would have done this a long time ago if I knew I could get more power THIS easily!\" He laughed as he looked up at the Spirit King. \"Look out you pathetic bug! I'm coming to get you and there's nothing you can do to stop me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spirit King knew he was right. Jinta had officially shattered his limits and was now drawing in more and more power, power that was getting to be beyond his own! The intake of power seemed to be increasing with ever second! Jinta's spiritual pressure was actually starting to break apart and disintegrate the smaller celestial bodies surrounding them. The slaves on Jinta's shoulder were totally overwhelmed by their god's power and were capable of nothing more than staring at Jinta as he prepared for to take the throne of Heaven. The Spirit King felt his primal survival instincts kick in and moved forward, to crush Jinta under his toes. He lifted his foot and brought it down on the red haired usurper, hoping to swiftly crush the life from him. It was not to be, however. Jinta merely raised his left arm, his non dominant one, and easily caught the foot. His body was pulsing with power, a red aura surrounding him. He was drawing in power naturally now, with no conscious thought or effort. He smirked up at the Spirit King from between the once great being's toes and said, \"Game over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Jinta began to grow. Within seconds his body was half the size of the Spirit King. With little effort he pushed and the Spirit King fell flat on his back, looking up at the still growing Jinta in terror. He had never known a power as great as this, a power that literally defied all logic and did the impossible. Jinta put his hands on his hips and effortlessly grew larger and larger. The Spirit King kept craning his neck back more and more to see Jinta rise into the sky. The clothes that had been provided with his power slowly shrank on the boy, showing off his ever developing, muscular body, until the shirt was bunched up around his chest. Within a few more seconds, rips split all over it, the fabric exploding when he so much as breathed. His shorts soon followed, hugging his massive thighs before splitting off, leaving him in just a pair of briefs. These, too, met their end, leaving Jinta totally naked, showing off his hot bod for all to see. He kept on growing, becoming more and more massive. The Spirit King shakily got to his feet and began to run, to avoid those gigantic toes that were slowly getting closer to him. Jinta noticed this and smirked again, crossing his arms. He grew faster, watching his toes chase the Spirit King who was becoming more and more speck like. He kept up just behind him, never moving, just growing, watching the Spirit King slowly get more and more tired. Soon, he collapsed on the ground, spent, totally at Jinta's mercy. Jinta managed to grab the less than speck like monarch from the ground and lift him up to his eye. He bellowed laughter out at the minuscule creature shaking with fear and said, \"Now, who was it you said had limits? Everything wasn't it? Well, here's one thing that DOESN'T HAVE ANY LIMITS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer force of his voice obliterated every sense the Spirit King had. He was suddenly nothing more than a blank slate, laying dumbly on the fingertip of a true god. Jinta knew this and, now mostly just posturing for himself, said, \"Don't have anything to say to that, huh? I guess it's time to show you who the true god is around here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta tossed the Spirit King in his mouth. The tiny body didn't even hit the tongue. It merely sailed down Jinta's throat and landed with an inconsequential splash in his belly. Jinta patted his stomach and sighed happily. It was done. He was now officially God.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The being once known as \u201cGod\u201d didn\u2019t even last a second inside Jinta churning gut. Moments after patting his stomach, Jinta felt the Spirit King\u2019s power become one with his own. However, no matter how mighty the blue-haired look-a-like was, the power boost was comparable to a droplet of water in an ocean. Even though Jinta didn\u2019t feel his power grow at all, he did feel strange new power course through his veins. He suddenly felt familiar with all of reality, as if he had walked every inch of it. He was now the new Spirit King, and could do anything he wished. He couldn\u2019t wait to test out his new abilities as the one and only god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bugs ready to see a show?\u201d Jinta asks his slaves as he cracks his knuckles. When he hears no response from the trio, the red head looks down to his shoulder to see his three slaves cowering. Jinta was just so impossibly huge for the three Soul Reapers to comprehend. They couldn\u2019t even tell where they were anymore, let alone watch whatever Jinta was about to do. It was only thanks to Jinta\u2019s divine senses that he could still see the germ-sized mortals. He could see that they were shaking under his massive spiritual pressure and incapable of even responding to his booming voice. \u201cHmmm\u2026well, you guys just hang tight for a minute. Try not to get crushed by my presence!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta directed his attention back in front of him and grinned widely. He outstretched one of his massive, god-like arms and opened his hand. Without warning, a small planet the size of Earth formed in his palm. The planet was beautiful, much like his former home, and could even be called superior to the blue planet. Next, Jinta materialized an entire population on the planet\u2019s surface. With a couple mere thoughts, Jinta had created a new planet and new life. An even smiled curved across the god\u2019s lips just before he closed his fist and grinded the celestial body into dust. It took just a little more effort to obliterate his creation; he actually had to move his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeeeeaaaaah\u2026\u201d Jinta murmured as he wiped the space dust on his abs. \u201cBeing God is going  be an eternity of fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta folded his arms across his chest and glanced around. If he was going to be Spirit King, he would need a palace. The last wimp had one, so it was only fair he did too. Jinta leaned back as if to sit down and his new throne materialized under him. Just as his sculpted buttocks hit the cushioned throne, the void around him began to change. Space and time warped and in a few seconds a \u201croom\u201d had been formed around the deity. Unlike the last Spirit King\u2019s realm, this one didn\u2019t look like a regal throne room at all. Instead, it looked like part of a teen\u2019s dream house. Posters sporting Jinta\u2019s likeness decorated the walls and statues of Jinta posing rested along those walls. A mini-fridge filled with soda cans laid next to the throne and Jinta reached over for one, popping it open and downing it in seconds. He burped loudly before crushing the can and disintegrating it in his hand. He looked around the room, satisfied with his work so far. There were a few doors leading to other rooms, but Jinta decided to create those rooms later. He had all the time in the universe to create his realm the way he wanted and he could fill it with whatever he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting his slaves to die under his spiritual pressure, Jinta shrank himself (and the room around him) down a bit so his slaves were back to being mere specks again. Now able to move and see their lord\u2019s face, the trio began praising their god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Lord Jinta!\u201d Ichigo yelled, his face showing nothing but compassion for his master. \u201cI had no doubt in my mind that you could defeat God! You\u2019re truly the most powerful being ever to exist!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, thanks a lot, carrot top. Don\u2019t stop there, though. Keep the praise coming!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they did. His three slaves showered their god with compliments while the red haired Spirit King leaned against his throne and poofing cans of pop in his hand to down in three gulps. After his fifth victory can, Jinta waved for his slaves to quiet down. After they obeyed, he plucked Hitsugaya into his hand and brought him up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready to shrink, Snowy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya nodded happily as Jinta brought a single finger up to Toshiro and pushed it against him. The slime inside the inferior god gathered onto Jinta\u2019s fingertip and his white haired slave began to shrink back down to his normal, speck-like size. Hitsugaya looked down at himself and smiled proudly as his god-like body returned to its normal, only slightly muscled appearance. After the deed was done, Jinta gathered the two other Soul Reapers into his hand, stood up, and placed the trio back onto the seat of the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou insects can get back to servicing me after I experiment with these powers of mine some more.\u201d Jinta told them as he stuck his finger into his mouth and ingested Hitsugaya\u2019s slime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake us with you, Lord Jinta!\u201d Hisagi pleaded a she got on his hands and knees and looked up at his towering master like a puppy. \u201cWe can\u2019t stand being away from you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry, 69 face! I\u2019ll only be gone for a bit. Take this time to rest, since you\u2019re going to be doing some slave work when I get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Jinta was gone. He didn\u2019t open a portal like he used to, he simply wasn\u2019t there anymore. As the supreme being, Jinta no longer needed to transport himself from one place to another. He could simply choose to exist wherever he wanted. His three slaves sighed with disappointment and sat down to rest. With their god gone, they did the only thing they could think of: talk about him. They discussed their favorite things about him and what they thought the universe was going to be like now that Jinta was in charge. Ichigo and Hisagi even asked Hitsugaya some uncomfortable questions about the previous night when he slept with him. The entire conversation would have seemed strange to most, but to the trio is was normal. To them, their god was the only thing that mattered anymore. No, not <i>their</i> god. THE god.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As of yet, the universe had yet to feel the true extent of what had happened. After Jinta had left the Earth to destroy the Spirit King, things had settled down. No one knew what what had happened or where the giant red head had gone. There was a distinct calm that pervaded the planet. People began to slowly emerge from hiding, those that had survived the massacre wrought on the planet by Jinta, Grimmjow, Hitsugaya (unintentionally), and Aizen and his Hollows, daring to hope that they would survive this whole ordeal. The planet was ruined, entire countries brought to their knees. Japan was utterly devastated, holes covering the area, entire cities and towns crushed, destroyed, or eaten, people broken and dead or living and fearing the return of the gods. The United States was little better off, millions of people dead, major states wiped out during the battle between Legion and Jinta. The people emerged, hope finally blossoming in their hearts after all of this cruel destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that hope was ultimately meaningless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta disappeared instantly from his new home realm and reappeared on the Earth's surface. His massive naked body was a sight to behold, and the power he now wielded was evident in his perfect shape and form. Not a single person who laid eyes on him had any doubt that this teenage giant was God, through and through. Jinta laughed as he looked out over the ruined planet. \"Man! We really did a number on you bugs didn't we? Well, good! This planet will make the perfect tool to test my new powers on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to grow, his body stretching up and out, his feet doing damage on a massive scale without him even having to move. The humans ran and screamed, trying to avoid the massive appendages and ultimately failing as the feet bulldozed over them. Jinta was eager to see how much abuse this planet could take. How much weight it could withstand. Soon, his feet covered all of the United States of America. The country sank under his unfathomable tonnage, the ground shattering under the weight, magma already starting to rise up and consume the area, the oceans rushing over the land until there was nothing left. Jinta shook his head and said, \"This is the most powerful country in the world? What a load of crap! It wouldn't even make a good footstool for a god like me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved on, still growing, his feet taking out entire countries in one step. He was a force of nature, a force that couldn't be challenged or stopped. The human race was at the whim of a cruel child who had gained mastery over the entire universe. Soon, Jinta had escaped the atmosphere, his massive upper body jutting out into space. Looking down, it was like he was striding over a road map of the world. He snickered at how pathetic everything looked from his height. He stopped moving and just stood on the most northern part of the planet, growing bigger and bigger, slowly crushing the world under his weight. He picked up the moon, still shaped as his face, and played with it like a human would with a ball. He inadvertently crushed it when he grew too big to handle it properly but merely created a new one and kept playing. He barely even had to think about it. Massive cracks started running over the planet, the core warping under the sheer weight of Jinta, magma flooding the Earth and turning it into a barren wasteland of destruction, the skies clouded by ash and smoke. All of this registered as nothing more than a pleasant tickle on Jinta's feet. He stepped off the Earth just before he smashed the thing into oblivion and sat down next to it. He slowly brought his feet together, rubbing the Earth between the enormous, soft soles, before bringing the feet together, smashing the Earth into dust. It was no more. The suffering of the human race had finally ended...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of his fingers, Jinta made the planet reform, all the humans present on it once more. Those who had been smashed or eaten in Karakura Town back when Jinta was merely hundreds of feet tall, now looked up in horror as the sky was filled with the eye of Jinta. That was all they needed to see. The malice, the cruelty, the joy of destruction in his eye was the same no matter his size. Some of the humans were sure they were still dead and this was their personal Hell. Others thought that Jinta was a second coming and was preparing to take them all to Heaven. Still others, and these were the fatalistic minority, knew what Jinta really was and were prepared to be a plaything for as long as Jinta was interested in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta sighed and gale force winds suddenly ripped South America apart. He laughed at how easy it was to harm the planet and said, \"I can't believe I used to live on this pathetic little mud ball! Look at it! Size of a baseball...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly grew larger. \"Size of a ping pong ball...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grew larger still. \"Size of a marble! Pathetic! I can balance it on one finger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive fingertip rose up and obliterated half the planet, the other half barely surviving as it ground to a halt in its rotation on Jinta's finger. He bellowed laughter at this and said, \"Damn! I barely have to do anything to destroy you microbes! But that's okay, because I can just bring you all back again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mere thought the Earth was whole again. He shrank himself down until the planet was the size of a basketball to him. He held it in his hands and peered down at the people. Without him even having to say anything they were worshiping him as God. He nodded approvingly and said, \"It's about time you specks understood! I'm God and you all survive on a whim! Tomorrow I might decide the Earth is a rotten place and crush it! And then, if I'm particularly mean spirited, I might not even bring it back! But as long as you all keep worshiping me and do exactly as I say, there won't be a problem! Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta couldn't hear the entire world unite as one to agree with his proposal, but he knew they got the message. He crushed the Earth between his hands again, tearing huge chunks of it off and eating it, using various parts of his body to destroy it, until it was gone again. *Snap!* And there it was again, same as ever. Jinta was loving every second of this. There was an entire universe out there for him to toy with. And he had all the time in the world to enjoy it!</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m going crazy!\u201d Ichigo screamed as he paced back and forth atop the gigantic throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, Kurosaki.\u201d Hitsugaya told the older-looking male. \u201cIt\u2019s only been five minutes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get used to this.\u201d Hisagi told him. \u201cA real god can\u2019t be cooped up in his realm for all eternity. He\u2019s probably going to do this a lot, and we won\u2019t be brought along every time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Ichigo pouted, but continued to pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust stop pacing, you\u2019re-\u201d the former captain stopped mid-sentence and glanced to his left. He stood up and continued looking to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Toshiro?\u201d the orange-haired teen asked. He didn\u2019t get reply and noticed Hisagi also standing up and looking in the same direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s another spiritual pressure here. Something\u2019s coming\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s coming?! I don\u2019t sense anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a small piece of Jinta\u2019s realm began to ripple as a doorway appeared out of thin air. The door just sat there for several seconds and the three Soul Reapers stared at it. It slowly creaked open until the opening was big enough for a lone figure to step out. Ichigo, Hisagi, and Hitsugaya were stunned at the appearance of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there!\u201d Urahara greeted, waving a hand at the three men-turned-slaves. Despite everything that had happened, the older man had never lost his joyful and unworried smile. As the former 12th Division captain stepped out of the door, his other hand came into view and was revealed to be carrying a King\u2019s Key. That would explain how he gained access to the realm, but where had he gotten it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKisuke! Where have you been all this time?\u201d Toshiro asked as the bucket hat wearing shop owner approached them and tucked the key into his robes. The doorway behind him faded away a quickly as it had appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiding. I was watching the entire time, putting my faith in you and Renji. Unfortunately, it would appear things did not go as planned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the best. A world ruled by Lord Jinta would be better than a world ruled by a dying coward\u2026or Aizen. I hope you haven\u2019t come to stand against Lord Jinta. It\u2019s pointless, Kisuke. You could down several gallons of that slime and you would never become a god that could defeat the one true God.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know. No one has any hope of becoming a god more powerful than him.\u201d Kisuke replied, waving hands to settle Hitsugaya down. \u201cI\u2019ve come to surrender myself to Lord Jinta. If you can\u2019t beat them, join them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Well, I guess it\u2019s fine then!\u201d Ichigo cut in, grinning at Urahara. \u201cI\u2019m sure Lord Jinta will make you his slave, since you are the reason his accession to godhood began. Don\u2019t think he owes you anything, though. The first Spirit King helped Lord Jinta a lot and he was rewarded with a one-way trip to our god\u2019s gut! You try to make yourself any more important than you are and I assure you you\u2019ll regret it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get it, Ichigo. I\u2019m just another insect to Lord Jinta, that\u2019s all. Now, how about we all just relax and have some tea? I can see our lord isn\u2019t here at the moment, so why not enjoy ourselves?\u201d Kisuke reached into his robes and pulled out a large tray, complete with four teacups and a kettle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026where were you keeping that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Five minutes later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, this is nice.\u201d Toshiro muttered as he sat back with a cup of hot tea in his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like drinking some nice tea while basking in the majesty of our master\u2019s domain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can think of a few things.\u201d Hisagi replied. \u201cWhat about drinking sake while basking in the majesty of our master\u2019s domain? That would be relaxing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re both wrong.\u201d Ichigo cut in. \u201cNothing can beat drinking our lord\u2019s own sweat while basking in the majesty of his own godly body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four males nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe universe sure is going to be interesting with Lord Jinta in charge.\u201d Kisuke said as he poured some more tea. \u201cIt was a lot of fun watching him climb to the top. He went through a lot of battles to get here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were all intense battles, too.\u201d Hisagi said, recalling all the fight she had witnessed while clinging to his master\u2019s body. \u201cNow, however, he\u2019s the Spirit King and no one can challenge him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not entirely sure. There is one being that could have challenged him\u2026if he was still alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? Lord Jinta is GOD. What can fight that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Spirit King is not only a title, but also a force. All forces have an opposite, including the Spirit King. If he consider the Spirit King to be \u201cGod\u201d, then its opposite would not be a god, but a demon. A \u201cDevil\u201d, if you will\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way. Are you saying there\u2019s really such a thing as the Devil?\u201d Ichigo asked, not buying Urahara\u2019s story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, you could call it the Devil anyway. You\u2019ve seen the gates of Hell, haven\u2019t you? Deep inside that realm is the throne of the Hell King, a throne that has been empty for countless years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of this \u201cHell King\u201d\u2026\u201d Toshiro repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot surprising. Not many people do. He hasn\u2019t existed since the only carrier of the title was defeated by the original Spirit King long enough. The Spirit King destroyed the Hell King\u2019s body and threw his spirit into Hell. Over time, the spirit faded away and now only his unimaginable energy remains\u2026sealed inside his worn down throne.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026there\u2019s nothing to worry about then. The only being that could challenge Lord Jinta has long since been dead.\u201d Ichigo went back to smiling and drank another cup of hot tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue\u2026but his power is still there. Just as Jinta absorbed the power of the Spirit King, one could travel into Hell and take the power of the Hell King. That person would have enough power to fight Lord Jinta on equal terms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026and who\u2019s going to do that?\u201d Hisagi laughed, followed by his two companions. Kisuke also chuckled a bit and brought his cup to his lips. His eyes looked from Ichigo to Hisagi to Hitsugaya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who indeed\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrahara used his free hand to feel around in his coat. His fingers came upon a glass syringe containing a yellow liquid. This liquid, if his research was correct, would clear the mind of one who was brainwashed by Jinta. His researched showed that these three had somehow become corrupted by just being around the giant teen. Was it some kind of energy he radiated, or perhaps it was just his B.O. that had a unique property to it. Whatever the reason, it could be undone with his antidote. He only had enough to use on one of them, though. After he made his choice, he would bring that person to his side and then\u2026well\u2026send them to Hell.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Out of all the Soul Reapers here...Ichigo was the obvious choice to use. He was the strongest of the three and he had been in servitude the longest. When he got his will back and realizes all he has had to do, all of the things he had said, and the way he had prostrated himself as a lesser being before a kid who had gotten too big for his britches...he was going to be pissed. He had to be quick and careful though. If Jinta came back it would be incredibly difficult for him to inject Ichigo and get him to Hell's throne. He had to act now. Thinking fast, he looked up and over the other three's heads and said, \"Look! Lord Jinta has returned!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them turned their heads to look, smiles on their faces. Urahara moved fast and stabbed Ichigo in the neck, covering his mouth as he did so, pressing the plunger and injecting the teen with the antidote. Ichigo instantly stopped struggling and went limp in Urahara's arms. Before the other two could even turn their heads back Kisuke used the King's Key to return to his hiding place with Ichigo. Hitsugaya and Hisagi turned around with frowns on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lord Jinta isn't...huh?\" Hisagi looked around as he noticed they were missing two people. \"What's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya looked angry as he said, \"Kisuke tricked us! He wasn't coming here to join Lord Jinta at all! He's kidnapped Ichigo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi clenched his fist and said, \"That bastard! We have to go after them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya sighed and said, \"We can't! The only way we could follow him is if we had a King's Key. We'll have to wait for Lord Jinta to return and inform him of what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi crossed his arms and said, \"I don't like it...but you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the two Soul Reapers waited restlessly for Jinta to return. Meanwhile, Ichigo's head was finally clearing up, Jinta's influence no longer controlling him. He looked at Urahara and said, \"Ow, my head...What's been going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll remember soon enough Ichigo.\" Kisuke said with a serious look. \"But we don't have a lot of time to dilly dally so listen up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo wasn't listening. His eyes grew wide as he remembered his experiences being broken, beaten, and servile to Jinta. He clenched his fists, his whole body shaking with rage. \"That bastard...I'M NOT GOING TO LET HIM GET AWAY WITH THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked ready to charge back into battle, but he was lacking Zangetsu. The sword had long since been absorbed into Jinta's body and was now unable to aid Ichigo. Urahara sighed and said, \"Listen Ichigo, I know you're angry at Jinta but you can't do anything with your current power. Now you really are less than a germ to him. He could end your life a thousand different ways in less than a second, torture you to the end of time, and do anything he wants with your body. He is God now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo punched the wall and said, \"I don't care! I can't let him get away with this! Even if there's no hope I still want to try and beat him down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisuke whipped out his fan and said, \"Oh sure, that sounds like a great plan. Run right back to Jinta and have him rip you into tiny pieces, or throw you into the vacuum of space, or boil you in acid, or make you pleasure him, or make you rub his massive feet before crushing you, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright already! I get the point! What am I supposed to do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrahara smacked Ichigo on top of the head with his fan and said, \"You're not listening Ichigo. Remember what I said just a few minutes ago? I didn't tell you that story about Hell and the Hell King for nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo blinked and said, \"Oh yeah...Hey! If I get that power I'll be able to stomp Jinta for good!\" He grinned and slammed his fist into his other hand. \"That's your plan right? Give me the Hell King's power so I can finish Jinta off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisuke smiled and said, \"Exactly! Now you're thinking! But it's not going to be easy. You're not just going to be able to traipse down into Hell and steal the Hell King's power. There are nine circles to Hell, each circle guarded by a demon of vast power. The Hell King's throne is in the ninth and final circle, his power contained inside his throne. To get his power, you'll have to battle through each circle, defeat each demon guardian, and then shatter the throne to absorb the power that lies within it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's mouth dropped open. \"You've gotta be kidding me! I can't do that! I don't even have Zangetsu with me! I won't stand a chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet you were so willing to go and try and beat Jinta who is billions of times more powerful than any demon in Hell. I'm not sending you in without help.\" He reached into his robe and pulled out a brightly glowing vial. \"I still have some of that slime left over. This will give you enough power to help get you through Hell. The first few guardians will probably fall pretty easily to you after you ingest this. The ones after will be more difficult to take down. The one guarding the ninth circle...well, hopefully this slime is fast acting or you won't have it in you to kill him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care how tough they are! Anything is better than being forced into servitude by that bastard!\" Ichigo grabbed the vial and popped the cork out, downing it in one gulp. \"How long will this stuff take to activate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrahara pulled a watch out of his pocket and said, \"Let's see...about fifteen minutes. I was working on refining it further while I was gone. Like your friends said, no matter how much of this slime you take you won't be able to reach Jinta, not even close, but it should be enough to get you to the power that can challenge Jinta. Now, I can't come with you since I'd just be a liability down there. So I'm going to reveal the gate and the rest is up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisuke twisted the King's Key around until it had a warped shape. It glowed red and black, malevolence oozing from it like an evil miasma. \"This...is the Devil's Key. It's made the same way as the King's Key but only one ever existed. The original Spirit King never wanted anyone to even try and claim Hell's power so he hid it away. When he died, I was able to find it and obtain it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and pointed the key at thin air. Fire erupted from the ground as everything around them grew dark, an oppressive air pressing down on them. Kisuke turned the key slowly and a loud clunking noise was heard, as if massive tumblers were turning in a gigantic lock. When the sound echoed into silence the fire coalesced until the Gates of Hell were visible, the two skeletal doorkeepers holding the handles. Urahara smiled and said, \"There you go! Head on in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo stepped forward, sweating slightly. He didn't know what to expect on the other side of this door but he knew he had to overcome it, no matter what. He was about to touch the door when Kisuke suddenly said, \"Oh! Two things before you go! One: The guardians of the circles all contain a tiny portion of the Devil's power. You're going to have to absorb each one as you go to get the full strength of the Hell King. Two: Jinta can't follow you. The Spirit King is unable to enter Hell and the Hell King is unable to enter the Spirit King's realm. In order to fight, you're going to both have to meet on the neutral ground of our universe. That's the only way you two can settle this. So, it's either stay in your own realms and let bygones be bygones for eternity, or fight. I'm sure you'll make the right choice Ichigo Kurosaki. Good luck~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo kept all this in mind as he kicked the door, hard. \"Hey! Open up! I want in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gatekeepers slowly pulled open the doors, revealing a dark, swirling portal. The first circle awaited him. Without a second thought, Ichigo jumped into the portal, the doors slamming shut behind him. Urahara sighed and pulled his hat down over his eyes. \"Well, it's all up to him now.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The decent into Hell took a lot longer than Ichigo thought. The next ten minutes was a fast decent down a hellish tunnel. Around him, Ichigo could see flames and the outline of people flash by him. He wasn\u2019t fully focused on the sights, however. He spent the entire ten minutes thinking about everything he had done while under Jinta\u2019s influence. He had watched so many of his friends die, sat on the boy\u2019s shoulder as he destroyed countless lives, and allowed him to ascend to God\u2019s throne. Hisagi and Hitsugaya were under the same spell, and neither of them knew it. Ichigo knew he had to become the Hell King to set things right. Perhaps after Jinta was finally put down, he could absorb the power of the Spirit King and turn everything back to the way it was. Ichigo was reminded that he was falling when the scenery finally changed. he was spat out of the tunnel and saw ground quickly approaching. He braced himself and crashed into the ground, creating a large dust cloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw\u2026that\u2026didn\u2019t hurt as much as it should have, actually.\u201d Ichigo said to himself as he stood up and dusted himself off. As the dust cleared, he took a gander at the realm around him. Hell looked pretty much like how he imagined it; pools of lava, a wasteland of brimstone, and a scorching heat. At first Ichigo thought he was alone, but was quickly corrected when the ground around him began to crack to life. Humanoid creatures began burrowing their way to the surface, having sensed the disturbance. These creatures were nor human or Hollow, but perhaps once were. Their faces looked like they were covered in masks of stone and their fingernails looked like someone had forgotten to cut their nails for a few years. When one of the demons approached Ichigo and spoke, the Soul Reaper saw that his mouth was not filled with teeth and a tongue, but a blackish void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is this possible? You are here, and yet you are alive. This should not be\u2026\u201d the creature snarled, its eyes lighting up red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Ichigo Kurosaki, I\u2019m-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t care who you are, mortal.\u201d another demon interrupted him. \u201cWe only care that you are alive. A living soul\u2026we are curious as to what it would taste like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo glared at the hungry-looking demons as he instinctively reached for his sword. When he remembered it wasn\u2019t there, he muttered a curse as the group of demons roared and dove at him. Ichigo did the only other thing he could: turn around and run the hell away. The group of soul eaters were in fast pursuit, and their numbers seemed to multiply with every step. What was once a group of twenty or so demons had quickly become more than a hundred. Ichigo continued to run for his life, refusing to die just minutes after arriving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, slime, hurry up! I\u2019m not going to become dinner for a bunch of demons!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this, Ichigo looked ahead and spotted a second group of creatures. He stopped himself before he ran right into the demon\u2019s hungry claws. Spinning around, his pursers caught up with him and surrounded him. There was no place for the orange haired teen to go; he was surrounded by snarling demons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour presence here must mean that the seal on Hell\u2019s gate must have been broken. After we have dealt with you, we will storm the world of the living and turn it into another Hell!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demons cried out as they charged for Ichigo. The former slave shut his eyes and waited for the pain to come, but instead felt a burst of power come from within him. He opened his eyes and smiled at the demons. The creatures slowed down as they noticed their prey begin tot rise. Ichigo\u2019s body quickly grew and took up more space, forcing his opponents to step back. In just a matter of seconds, Ichigo had grown to the size where the once frightening demons now appeared like five-inch tall toys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026good enough.\u201d Ichigo commented a she examined his body. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll grow more along the way, this is good enough to deal with the small fry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, the mortal has a few tricks up his sleeve. No matter, a bigger you just means a bigger meal for us! Attack!\u201d one of the demons yelled, signaling his companions to continue the charge. Ichigo got into his fighting stance and the fight began. While he lacked a blade, his fists and legs were the only weapons he needed. The horde of demonic creatures attempted to jump and attack him from everywhere, but Ichigo\u2019s dodging and counter speed allowed him to fend off most of the attackers. It only took a swift punch or kick to dispatch a demon. If they weren\u2019t killed on contact, they were probably killed when their body landed after being sent into the distance. Before long, Ichigo made short work of the demons and he was surrounded by their broken carcasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that their taken care of, time for the guardian.\u201d Ichigo looked at the ground and spotted a surviving demon. He grinned and snatched him up, bringing him to his face. \u201cWhere\u2019s the guardian of this circle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-the g-guardian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, t-the g-guardian.\u201d Ichigo repeated, mocking the demon\u2019s stuttering. \u201cTell me where he is so I can kick his ass!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpit it out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m the guardian!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo stared at the small demon for a few moments before covering his mouth with his free hand to suppress his laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU? You Don\u2019t look any different from the other wimps!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t group me with them, mortal! My battle skills outclass everyone on this circle, so I was given the privilege of being its guardian!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, sure\u2026\u201d Ichigo chuckled a bit more. \u201cWell, let\u2019s see your skills.\u201d The giant opened his fist and let the demon fall to the ground, hitting the brimstone with his demonic buttocks. \u201cI\u2019ll make the first move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-?\u201d The guardian started to say, before he was forever silenced by the giant\u2019s huge bare foot. He did even get the chance to get off his butt, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was easy enough\u2026\u201d Ichigo said as he picked his foot off the flattened demon. He watched the squashed remains turn into a black mist that flew up and sank into Ichigo\u2019s chest. A black tint covered Ichigo as he felt a new power inside him. \u201cThis power\u2026it reeks of the most evil spiritual energy I\u2019ve ever sensed. This has to be part of the Hell King\u2019s power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Soul Reaper scanned the ground and saw one of the defeated demons twitching. He scooped him into his hand and brought him up to his eyes. The demon\u2019s legs had been nicked by one of his punches, shattering them and leaving him immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, how do I get to the second circle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026well\u2026there\u2019s a giant hole to the east that leads to the second circle. Each level has one and it\u2019s the only way to get to each floor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Ichigo mumbled before chucking the demon over his shoulder and began walking east. He soon reached the edge of the hole the demon had spoken of. Ichigo peered down into it and saw nothing but a black abyss. Without a second thought, Ichigo leaped into the hole and continued with his trials. Something told him their would be A LOT of falling during these trials\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo headed down into the Second Circle of Hell, where the demons were bigger, stronger, and more numerous. As Ichigo continued down his journey Jinta was still having fun with the Earth. He had picked it up, tossed it around, ate it, crushed it underneath every part of his body, and he still wasn't bored. He was about to crush it between his toes for the tenth time when he felt a sudden uneasiness rush through him. He had no way of knowing it, but Ichigo had crushed the second guardian. With every bit of power that was added to Ichigo, Jinta felt an emotion that he hadn't felt for a long time: Uneasiness. It was not a full fledged fear. Jinta felt like he could never be afraid again. His mind had been hardened and strengthened by surviving the Infinity Corp. But he still didn't like this feeling. It felt like something was coming up from behind him. The hairs on the back of his neck prickled. The longer he tried to ignore it, the more it prickled. Finally, after Ichigo bested the third guardian, Jinta finally got fed up with it and decided to go back to his realm to figure out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up you microbes!\" He addressed the planet. \"I'm leaving you to take care of some business! When I get back I'm going to keep playing with you! So don't go anywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bellowed with laughter as he said this. The humans could understand his laughter. There was no place they could go to escape the young vengeful god. No place in the universe was safe. Jinta blinked out of existence and reappeared in his realm, directly in front of his throne. Hisagi and Hitsugaya jumped as Jinta suddenly reappeared. Jinta frowned as he saw that Ichigo was missing, his unease growing as Ichigo finished off the fourth guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is carrot top?\" Jinta asked in a low, dangerous voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya and Hisagi immediately threw themselves on their stomachs and began babbling an explanation, scared by the expression on their Lords face. Jinta's face darkened further and he shouted, \"SHUT UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice wrapped around Hitsugaya and Hisagi and froze their bodies and voices. Jinta pointed at Hitsugaya and said, \"Snowy! Tell me what happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya was able to sit up and speak. \"It was Kisuke Urahara. He came from out of nowhere claiming to be surrendering to you. We assumed he was sincere since trying anything against you at this point in time would be useless. Unfortunately, he kidnapped Ichigo! I think he's planning on using him to unleash the power of Hell on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta's eyebrow arched as he said, \"Hell? What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed at Hisagi who said, \"Urahara talked about a power that could rival God's. It was that of the \"Devil\", a being that fought with the original Spirit King. He lost and was sealed in his throne in Hell. Eventually, only his power remained. We believe Urahara is using Ichigo to reclaim that power and use it to fight against you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta snorted and laughed. He kept laughing, holding his stomach as it began to hurt. When tears were starting to stream down his face he sighed  and said, \"That's a good one! Even if carrot top got a power that could rival the original Spirit Bug I'm a lot more powerful than he ever was! I'm infinite! Nothing can stand up to me! Carrot top's just going to have to get beat down again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cracked his knuckles with a grin as he said this, the growing uneasiness replaced with growing excitement. Now that he knew what was coming he wanted to face Ichigo again on semi equal terms. His defiance would be a refreshing reminder of the old days when he played with Ichigo like a toy instead of dominating him like a bug. Eventually he'd get bored and drain off the power that Ichigo gained and everything would be back as it was. He stretched and said, \"I can't believe I was getting all worked up over something so stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crossed his arms as he looked down at his remaining slaves. \"Move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited exactly six seconds, watching his slaves scramble in opposite directions to avoid their god's giant ass coming down on them. Jinta settled into his throne and said, \"Man, torturing and playing with the Earth really took it out of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached down on either side of him and lifted his minuscule slaves up to his face. \"I'm down one slave so you two each get a foot to yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and dropped them down, the slaves floating down to his feet. He stuck them out in front of the former Soul Reapers and said, \"Get to work! Whoever finishes first gets to help me with something else! Whoever loses, gets punished underneath my foot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all it took to spur his slaves into action. They would have gladly serviced their master's foot without the threat of punishment. Nothing could hurt them worse than the thought that they had failed their god. So they threw themselves into their work, wanting to move on and help Lord Jinta with whatever he needed.</span></div></div>",

Keeping track of time was difficult, but it was a good guess to think that he\u2019d been down here at least three days. Most of that time was spent searching for each circle\u2019s guardian,  who was always a weak little thing that was too chicken to approach the giant Ichigo. Urahara had greatly underestimated him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, only the final 9th circle was left. It was the smallest floor and not a soul lived down there. It was a frozen wasteland enveloped in silence. That several thousand year silence was finally broken when out of the large hole in the ceiling fell a lone figure. The figure smashed into the ground, creating a loud boom that echoed through the realm and covered him in a white cloud. Two red eyes peered out of the cloud and the owner of those eyes slowly walked out of the smokescreen. In seconds, Ichigo\u2019s entire form was revealed to the empty floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager had undergone a grand transformation during his time in Hell. His orange hair, once short and spiky, was now wild and drooped down to his waist. He had grown so much in size and muscle that the last guardian he had defeated was the size of gnat. Most of his clothes had torn off, save for his tight pants that were starting to show signs of tearing. The Substitute Soul Reaper\u2019s eyes had the ability to turn red at any time and his teeth were razor sharp, putting even Grimmjow to shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo walked through the 9th circle for several minutes until his eyes fell upon his ultimate goal. There, at the center of a frozen lake, was the throne of the Hell King. Unlike the Spirit King\u2019s throne, it was not elegant or beautiful at all. It looked like it had been built in three minutes and was starting to fall apart, but Ichigo didn\u2019t care. He had come here to get the throne\u2019s power and become a being to rival Jinta; nothing more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one more guardian and I\u2019m done\u2026\u201d Ichigo muttered to himself as he scanned the base of the throne, thinking the guardian was hiding somewhere at its base. As he approached it, he suddenly felt a piercing pain in his chest. The orange haired teen\u2019s eyes bulged as he grabbed his chest in agony. The pain was unbearable\u2026like something inside him was trying to dig its way out\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ehehehehe\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo became surrounded in a red glow as he fell to his knees. His eyes turned bright red as his arms flew outward and a strange, white goo emerged from his chest. The slime-like substance flowed out of him like torrent from a hose and collected onto the throne. Slowly the white substance began to shape itself. First arms became visible, than legs, a torso, a head. When the figure had fully formed, Ichigo peered up into the smiling face of\u2026himself. His white-skinned self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowdy, king. Kneeling before me already?\u201d his Hollow self joked, smirking amusingly. Ichigo glared at the Hollow angrily as he got to his feet. He didn\u2019t just look like him, he looked like his current appearance. The long hair, sharp teeth, bare torso, everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow? I thought Jinta-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou thought Jinta trapped me? Don\u2019t make me laugh, Soul Reaper! As you absorbed the Hell King\u2019s power and grew in power, so did I! I managed to break out of that weak barrier days ago, but I\u2019ve been waiting silently as you absorbed even more power. You didn\u2019t noticed, did you? You never noticed that you were only getting HALF what you took!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo\u2019s expression turned into shock. This awesome power he had\u2026it was only <i>half</i> of what he should have? He already felt like he could challenge Jinta!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I guess that makes you the last guardian, right? I defeat you and all of the Hell King\u2019s power becomes mine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly. I don\u2019t know what happened to the last guardian, but it looks like he got bored of guarding the last circle where no one ever came. He sealed his portion of the Hell King\u2019s power\u2026inside this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHollow Ichigo cackled insanely as he gripped the armrests of the throne. Almost immediately the throne glowed with a dark spiritual energy that flowed into his Hollow self through is arms. The white skinned Ichigo\u2019s eyes turned red and Ichigo though he saw sparks of energy crackle from them. His inner Hollow threw his head back as the power surge ended, as if just climaxing. Ichigo watched the teenage-looking being chuckle as he picked himself off the throne and stood before Ichigo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeeeaah, now I\u2019m the king, baby!\u201d Hollow Ichigo yelled as he clenched his fists and looked over himself. \u201cSee me now, Soul Reaper? We\u2019re no longer equal! I have more of the Hell King\u2019s power in me then you, so there\u2019s no way you can win! I\u2019ll take the power you absorbed, stomp <i>Lord</i> Jinta for trapping me in that prison, and send the entire universe into chaos!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mad demon laughed manically, the very volume of his voice cracking the lake around them. When he was finished, he peered at Ichigo and saw that\u2026 </span></div></div>",

His Hollow self looked at Ichigo in surprise and said, \"Hmph...You're not worried at all! You're not screaming! You're not fighting! You're not doing anything! What's the matter with you?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo smirked and said, \"I was just waiting for you to finish making a fool of yourself. I think it's hilarious that you think you can even put up a fight against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white skinned Ichigo snorted and started laughing again. \"Such bravado! I suppose I should expect if from the likes of you. You've always managed to put me away before but now what gives you such confidence? I have the majority of the Hell King's power! I know how to use it in ways you've never even dreamed! So what makes you think you can stop me this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo laughed himself now. \"Dream on! While you've been trapped behind that barrier I've been hanging around with Jinta! I've seen him, Hitsugaya, Hollows, Grimmjow and even Renji for awhile using these kinds of powers! I know more about them than you ever could!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHollow Ichigo suddenly dashed forward and punched Ichigo as hard as he could in the stomach. His speed was blinding. Ichigo grunted and spat up blood, the force of the punch rupturing some of his internal organs. The demonic creature laughed wildly and said, \"See?!? SEE?!?!? You're weak! You're pathetic! You're nothing more than a bug to me! I'm going to rip you to shreds and suck out the last vestiges of power you have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo laughed weakly and said, \"Wow...I can't believe it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, are you finally realizing that you were incredibly foolhardy to even THINK of challenging me?\" the Hollow mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo shook his head and said, \"I can't believe...you fell for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smirk was wiped off Hollow Ichigo's face as he felt a massive kick hit the back of his head. He went flying forward, skidding across the ice, slamming into the wall. Ichigo cracked his knuckles and said, \"Part of the Hell King's power is the powers of sin! I created a clone of myself using the power of Deceit! You were so busy gloating that you didn't even realize I was hiding right behind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloned Ichigo disappeared while Ichigo slowly moved towards his Hollow self. He was laying on the ground in a daze, the kick muddling his mind. He knew he had to move, to think fast or else Ichigo would continue to beat on him but he couldn't seem to string two coherent thoughts together. Ichigo grabbed the creature by the throat and slammed him against the wall. He began to pummel him, punching him at every available point, his punches strengthened by a demonic power, making his fist harder, faster, and stronger. \"And now..*Punch* I'm using....*Whack* The power of *Smash* Treachery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis last punch smashed Hollow Ichigo in the face, breaking several teeth and smashing his nose into a bloody stump. He was in horrible shape, his arms and legs broken, his organs obliterated, his insides bleeding. He did indeed have more power than Ichigo...but he had failed to use it when he had the chance and was now unable to do anything to defend himself. Ichigo grinned as he held up the hand that wasn't holding his Hollow self. It glowed black and he said, \"And now...I'll use the power of Envy...and take what's yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed his hand against the broken being before him and began to draw out the power that dwelt inside. Swiftly the once fierce creature before him began to dwindle in size until he was nothing more than a broken bug pinned to the wall. Ichigo drew out the last of the Hell King's power within him and shuddered. Such power...it was filling him to overflow! He had never felt such power! He felt like he could take on anyone and win with ease! Without a second thought he smashed the pathetic creature that he was holding and walked over to the throne. His other self had drained most of the power out of the throne and Ichigo had subsequently drained that power from him so there was only a few vestiges of power left in the throne. However, Ichigo wasn't about to let such delicious power go to waste. He sat on the throne and gripped the hand rests tightly, dark energy surging out of the weak structure and filling his body with a malevolent power. Ichigo started growing as he devoured the last of the Hell King's power, his bulk causing the throne to buckle and smash until he had crushed it completely under his body. He grinned and looked himself over. He looked the same, just much bigger, his muscles bulging, but the power he felt inside was limitless. He knew that Jinta would be nothing more than a child to him again. With the same powers, he was older, more experienced as a fighter, and more determined to win against the giant brat. He wasn't going to lose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Ichigo ascended, Jinta felt a foreboding presence in the back of his mind. He shivered involuntarily and said, \"What the hell was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya and Hisagi, who were still rubbing their god's feet, looked up at Jinta seemed distracted. They couldn't sense anything so they had no idea what was wrong. Jinta stared into space for awhile trying to determine what the feeling was but couldn't. He got frustrated and crossed his arms, glaring down at his slaves. \"Hey! Stop gawking and pick up the pace! I'm in a bad mood and might just punish you both if you don't work up to my standards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two slaves instantly went back to work, massaging as much of the massive foot as they could. Still...Jinta couldn't shake the feeling that something was up. He knew Ichigo was trying to beat him...but he had never expected to feel a power so much like his own. Could he be...equal to him? Jinta shook his head. No! What a stupid thought! No one in this or any universe was as powerful as he was! When that pathetic slave of his finally arrived to fight, he would destroy him completely and suck out that ridiculous power that had so troubled his predecessor! All he had to do...was wait.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNo point in waiting around!\u201d Ichigo shouted to the empty circle as he stepped away from the rubble of the word down throne. Despite is words, Ichigo did not leave Hell immediately. Wanting to reassure himself of the fact that he could thrash Jinta once and for all, the new Hell King summoned a giant mirror of crystal. The god-like demon stood in front of the mirror and looked himself over. He was no longer a Substitute Soul Reaper. He was no longer a human. He was no longer part Hollow. He was something else\u2026something that lacked a name. After flexing a bit and seeing that his new form was perfect in every way possible, Ichigo snapped his fingers and vanished just like that. He did not poof out of existence like Jinta, but disappeared in a burst of black fire. The sheer force of his exit was so powerful that it tore a crater into the ninth circle. Every soul in the realm felt their King leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo reappeared somewhere in the depths of space, far away from any celestial body he knew of. It was a completely different galaxy. Ichigo folded his arms over his chest and thought about how he was going to call the Spirit King here. Why not just tell him where he was? Or show him? Ichigo did just that and began releasing as much of his spiritual pressure as possible. His evil and dark spiritual energy washed over the galaxy, drenching any planets and stars in came across. Anything his spiritual pressure touched was doomed to die. Unfortunately for the civilizations that happened to populate this galaxy; their deaths were not quick. Ichigo\u2019s spiritual pressure did not simply crush the planets, it singed them like an invisible fire. People found themselves bursting into flames for no apparent reason. They watched their forests, their homes, and even their water sources combust into fire. After just one minute of releasing his spiritual pressure, every planet within the first four solar systems were turned into black orbs of ash that broke to pieces if Ichigo so much as sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jinta was leaning back in his throne with his eyes closed trying to figure out what was bugging him so much. Suddenly, his eyes shot open and he leaned up as if he had just woken up from a bad dream. Hisagi and Toshiro were oblivious to their lord\u2019s troubled mind and kept on rubbing his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove.\u201d Jinta commanded for the second time that day. His two saves scurried out of the way to avoid being squashed when Jinta placed both his bare feet onto the floor. Once the new Spirit King was standing, he looked down at his two servants and said, \u201cI\u2019m heading out again. You two wait there for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Hisagi shouted in disbelief. \u201cNo, Lord Jinta! Please don\u2019t leave us again! Why can\u2019t you take us with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a couple bugs to look after while I want to have some fun. I only played with Earth the last time, and there\u2019s a whole universe out there for me to toy with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but, master, it\u2019s so hard being away from you! We need you as much as we need food or water!\u201d Hitsugaya pleaded, dropping to his knees by the god\u2019s giant toes. Jinta shot the white-haired boy an angry glare that sent shivers down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you actually putting your needs above mine? You wanna be punished, snowball?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no! Forgive me, Lord Jinta! I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m a fool.\u201d Hitsugaya blurted out, bowing before his lord and master. Jinta sighed and knelt down to get a closer look at his slaves. They were trying to hide it, but both of them looked tired and hungry. Jinta waved one of his hands over the floor and, out of nowhere, a giant plate with a single giant rice ball appeared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou both haven\u2019t eaten in awhile. Chow down on this while I\u2019m gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh\u2026thank you, Lord Jinta.\u201d Hitsigaya said, bowing again. He and Hisagi ran over to the giant plate and grabbed handfuls of the giant snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is delicious, master! Your generosity is, like everything else about you, unmatched!\u201d Hisagi praised as he took another bite. When he looked back up, however, he noticed Jinta was already gone\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red haired deity tracked down the source of the overwhelming spiritual pressure and warped close to it. It didn\u2019t take him long to notice the huge figure in front of him. The figure had his back turned to him with his long hair flowing as if it was caught in a breeze. When he noticed Jinta\u2019s presence, the figure stopped releasing his spiritual pressure and turned to face Jinta with a toothily grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time, brat!\u201d Ichigo exclaimed. \u201cI was starting to think you weren\u2019t getting my message.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! You may as well hold up a big sign saying \u2018Here I am, come get me\u2019.\u201d Jinta replied, giving Ichigo a similar grin. Both titans stared at each other in silence before a sigh from Jinta broke it. \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed in you, carrot top. You were my most loyal slave, and now look at you. What did that bastard Urahara do to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe simply freed me from the spell you put me under. We were never truly following you; you had us under some kind of hypnosis!\u201d Ichigo pointed a finger at Jinta as he declared this. Jinta, however, just shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what your talking about, carrot top. You followed me because you knew I was bigger, stronger, and more powerful than you could ever be. You knew that it was either following me or ending up dead. You made the wise choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore! I\u2019m going to pay you back for everything you did to Earth, to Soul Society, and to me! You climbed to the top, now I\u2019m knocking you back down and burying you! Once I kill you, I\u2019ll rip apart your soul so you can\u2019t even go to Hell! The great and almighty Jinta\u2026gone! Like he never even existed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep dreaming, carrot top! I\u2019m taking that new power from you and turning you back into a sniveling slave. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, and nothing you do is going to change that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spirit King, Jinta Hanakari. The Hell King, Ichigo Kurosaki. The two titans got into their fighting stances and glared at each other. Ichigo glared at his former master. Jinta glared at his former slave. One of these two kings would be left standing to decide the fate of the universe. The other\u2026well\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two stared at each other, feeling each other out, their bodies tense with inaction, preparing themselves for whatever happened. Both of them had devastating powers at their disposal that could be activated with a mere thought. Anything could happen. Finally, Jinta made the first move! He charged forward, preparing to punch Ichigo in the face but his fist met with a powerful barrier. Ichigo smirked and grabbed Jinta's head, slamming it down on his knee. Jinta's nose connected with the appendage and burst into a flower of blood. He stumbled back and held his streaming nose glaring at Ichigo. The orange haired teen didn't let up. He ran forward and punched Jinta as hard as he could in the gut, his fist strengthened by his massive spiritual pressure. The air was forced from Jinta's lungs, blood splattering out of his mouth and speckling Ichigo's body. Ichigo laughed and said, \"Some God you turned you to be! You're already coughing up blood and I haven't even broken a sweat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-shut up carrot top! I'm just getting warmed up!\" Jinta held his hands out in front of Ichigo and pushed him back with his gravity powers. Ichigo was flung backward, crashing through planets, stars, solar systems, galaxies, his body tearing through them like they were paper, before coming to a halt a distance away. Before he could recover and do anything a fist appeared next to him and slammed him across the face, but didn't stop there. Fists appeared from all directions, crashing into Ichigo's body, bruising it, cutting him in places where the knuckle grazed, the fists powered by his own spiritual pressure. Jinta smirked from his position far away, watching as Ichigo's body was pushed around by his fists. With a grin he jumped up into the air, made a portal open beneath him, and slammed both of his feet, hard, onto Ichigo's head. Ichigo stopped his body from plummeting too far down in the void of space and glared up at Jinta who was laughing at him. \"See? Told ya so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo held up his hand and shouted, \"By the sin of Lust, I command you to come over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the perfect incantation but it served it's purpose. Jinta felt his body obeying a compulsion that wasn't his own, forcing him to plummet after Ichigo at break neck speed. He couldn't stop himself as Ichigo kicked him, hard, in the stomach. Jinta was flung back but only a few feet before getting tugged back towards Ichigo. A kick slammed into his face, forcing him back once more. Every punch and kick that hit Jinta forced him back but the compulsion of Lust kept bringing him closer to Ichigo, his body unable to move itself. Jinta spit out a tooth that got kicked loose and shouted, \"STOP IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for him, the power of his voiced orders had enough authority over Ichigo to stop the Lust spell. Jinta wiped his mouth, his face pretty badly bruised and said, \"Not bad slave. Looks like you picked up some new tricks. But just try and stop this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his hands out and started cutting space and time around Ichigo, forming a barrier around him. Jinta brought his hands together, the barrier contracting around Ichigo, slowly crushing him. Jinta grinned at his success only to have that grin turn to a look of shock as Ichigo shouted, \"Sin of Pride! Reflect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barrier expanded and turned inside out, twisting away from Ichigo and forming around Jinta! The only thing that stopped Jinta from getting crushed was his quick cutting, making a hole in the barrier before it crushed him. He glared at Ichigo who had crossed his arms, a smile on his face. \"You're a worse God than the Spirit King ever was! He at least managed to seal the Hell King in their fight. All you've done so far is get your ass kicked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo laughed at that while Jinta fumed, his anger at Ichigo growing. \"Don't count me out yet bug! I'll show you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that Jinta was bruised, broken, and bloodied, he still had his fierce determination which had helped him out many times before in these kinds of fights. His indomitable will to survive had kept him going against even the toughest of opponents. He got into a fighting stance and charged, aiming a punch at Ichigo's face again. Ichigo rolled his eyes and held his hand out. \"Sin of Greed! Barrier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta's fist slammed into a powerful barrier once again. Now he knew what had stopped in the beginning of the fight. He kicked out but hit the same barrier. \"Dammit! I'm going to kill you!\" Jinta screamed in a rage. Ichigo pulled back and punched through the barrier, hitting Jinta in the face once again. \"Give it up kid! The only reason you won so many damn times against me was because you were so much bigger than me! On equal footing you're just a snot nosed brat who bit off more than he could chew in pissing me off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo grabbed Jinta by the collar and punched him again and again, raining blows down over his body. Jinta was losing...badly. But he still refused to give up! He had gone into this fight blindly, without knowing what Ichigo's powers were. Now that he did know...a plan was forming in his mind. A plan of retaliation!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo gave Jinta one last punch to his face before putting a stop to the beating. He took a moment to gaze over Jinta and smirked at what he saw. Jinta was bruised all over, his face especially ruined. The teen sported a black eye, split lip, and a mouth that was missing one or two teeth. Ichigo cackled as he squeezed the boy\u2019s throat harder, causing him even more pain. Since they were both such godly beings, they no longer required oxygen to survive. Ichigo wasn\u2019t going to kill Jinta by lack of air, but his strong hold did threaten to snap his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look terrible, brat. Those were punches fueled by the power of Treachery! How did they feel, my former master?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBarely\u2026felt a thing.\u201d Jinta replied, smirking. Ichigo glared at the overconfident boy and clenched his fist. Jinta watched the Hell King\u2019s hand burst into black flames, casting an eerie shadow on Ichigo\u2019s demonic face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are the Flames of Wrath. Once punch fueled by these suckers is gonna feel like ten of those punches I just gave you!\u201d Ichigo warned. Jinta, however, still didn\u2019t sway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo your worse, carrot top!\u201d Jinta exclaimed as he raised his left hand. Before he could do anything with it, Ichigo grabbed it with his other hand. As his hand held Jinta\u2019s around the wrist, the Flames of Wrath burned the flesh and made Jinta clench his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! In a few seconds, your hand\u2019s going to be burnt to a crisp!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that!\u201d Jinta screamed in Ichigo face right before he suddenly kneed him in the crotch. Ichigo\u2019s eyes bulged out of his head as he howled in pain and released Jinta. His hands immediately flew down to his family jewels and covered them. No matter how much of a deity-like being he was, Ichigo was still male\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid that hurt?\u201d Jinta asked sarcastically as he looked at Ichigo\u2019s pained expression. \u201cNah, couldn\u2019t have! You\u2019re the big bad Hell King! I bet this won\u2019t hurt either!\u201d Jinta cracked a grin and kicked Ichigo right in his covered crotch. Ichigo screamed again as the blow sent him backwards. Jinta didn\u2019t let him go very far, however, and flew after him. He caught the older man by his leg and stopped him in his tracks. As all the blood rushed to Ichigo\u2019s head, Jinta waved his hand and formed a small \u201croom\u201d of warped space around them. He then began thrashing Ichigo around the room, smacking him into the walls, the floor, and the ceiling numerous times. Ichigo, who was still nauseous from the double blow to his weak spot, could only endure the blows. After the fifteenth impact, the room couldn\u2019t take anymore and shattered into tiny fragments. Jinta kept his firm grip on Ichigo\u2019s ankle and held him upside-down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou understand now, carrot top? You mess with me\u2026\u201d Jinta grabbed Ichigo\u2019s other ankle and spread his legs apart. He then positioned his foot so it was at the perfect angle to stomp Ichigo where it really hurt. \u201c\u2026and you get nothing but pain!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!!!\u201d Ichigo cried out just as Jinta brought his foot down. Before it could hit its target, it hit something else. Jinta looked down in confusion to see a small, concentrated barrier blocking his foot. Jinta snarled in annoyance and tried to force his foot through the barrier, but it\u2019s smaller form made it very durable. The pain in Ichigo\u2019s stomach began to subside and he took this opportunity to swing himself at Jinta, grabbing his own legs. The muscle bound devil pulled, surprising Jinta enough to release his own legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnoying pest!!\u201d Ichigo shouted as he tossed Jinta away. Jinta easily regained his balance, but when he looked up at Ichigo he saw him directly in front of him with his finger touching his forehead. \u201cSin of Sloth! Disable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta felt every fiber of his being freeze in place. He couldn\u2019t move his arms, legs, or even his eyes. He could only look directly in front of him as Ichigo wrapped his fist in the Flames of Wrath and reared it back. The next second, Ichigo had the same fist buried into Jinta gut. Strangely, despite his pervious warning, Jinta didn\u2019t feel a thing. Hell, the blow hadn\u2019t even budged him an inch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Flames of Wrath? More like Flames of Sissy!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta mentally laughed. When he could move again, he was going to show this bug what a real punch felt like. Ichigo smirked at Jinta and waved as if to say \u201csee ya\u201d. Why was he\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGAAH!!!\u201d Jinta spat out blood as the effects of disable wore off. His stomach pushed into his body as if an invisible fist had collided with it. The next thing he knew, he was spiraling backwards through space. Just as Ichigo before him, planets and other solar systems were brushed aside as his body crashed into them like a missile. Jinta only managed to stop himself by digging his fingers into the wall of reality and using it to slow him down. When he finally came to a halt, he had made several huge tears in space and time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta clutched his stomach and glanced down at it. It looked as if he had just been stamped with a searing hot piece of metal. His once perfect abs were barely visible now; as if they had been smoothed right off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBastard!\u201d Jinta cursed through his teeth. He glared over at Ichigo, who was slowly approaching him and cracking his knuckles as he went. Jinta decided it was about time to show him that his pesky Hell King powers were nothing compared to his own abilities. \u201cKeep on smirking, carrot top, you should know by now how I end all my battles. I grow until my opponent is nothing but a bug at my feet!\u201d</span></div></div>",

How wonderful it would be to smash Ichigo into paste under his single toe, drain all of his insignificant powers into himself, and teach Ichigo a lesson he'd never forget. His body slowly started growing, his height doubling in seconds, then tripling. Ichigo stopped as he saw the teen suddenly expand high above him. He smirked and shook his head. \"What an idiot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up his hand and simply said, \"Sin of Pride! Reflect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta's growth instantly halted. The teen looked around in shock, wondering just the hell had happened. Before he could even begin to guess, his body swiftly began shrinking, passing down, down, down, until he was as tall as Ichigo...and he continued to shrink! Ichigo, using his powers of Pride, had gained control of Jinta's growing power and was using it against him. He could shrink him down as much as he wanted. Unfortunately, after he stopped using the power, he would be able to grow back to any height he wanted. Ichigo would have to move fast. Jinta continued to shrink down, his body half Ichigo's size, than a quarter of it, shrinking down until he was up to Ichigo's ankle. He slowed the shrinking down, so that Jinta was only losing centimeters instead of inches and feet. He looked down on Jinta and said, \"Now you're becoming the bug you really are! How does it feel? You put so many other people in this position, so how does it feel to be the one facing down a foot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo picked up his foot and hovered it over Jinta. Jinta looked up, not impressed by Ichigo's threat. \"Yeah, so what? It's just a stupid foot! It's nothing like my godly foot It's the foot of a powerless, subordinate, SLAVE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo moved his foot and held his hand out over Jinta. \"Fine. Then I guess I'll have to show you what I mean first hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta began to rapidly shrink after this. His body dwindled past Ichigo's toes, the toes themselves turning into monolithic structures that stretched high into the sky above Jinta, each one stretching seemingly endlessly to either side of him. Jinta could tell, through his godly senses, that was he was shrinking down to human size, a size so tiny that Ichigo was an incomprehensible being of supreme size and power. Jinta couldn't see anything beyond the one, massive toe in front of him. He gulped a little, his heart racing just a bit faster. Ichigo was huge and he couldn't change his size...but he still had other powers! Ichigo wasn't going to crush him today. He was about to open a door into space when Ichigo's voice boomed down from on high, loud and rumbling like thunder, a voice of such commanding presence that Jinta couldn't help but stop and listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SEE? HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE THE HUMAN UNDER A SO CALLED GOD? NOW...JUST STAY STILL AND DIE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humongous toe disappeared from Jinta's eye sight, the entire foot rising high, high above him. Jinta could see the entire sole, Ichigo raised it so high. Beyond the sole, he could barely make out the towering leg rising far above his sight. Jinta, for the first time, realized what it was like to be an insignificant being, helpless, about to be crushed under a foot of mind boggling size. The appendage hovered unmoving for what felt like an eternity then...started falling with great force toward him! Jinta panicked, freezing. Then, his mind gave him a swift kick. What was he doing? He was a GOD! He held up his hands and ripped them down, tearing a big hold in space. He dove through it and ripped another hole, appearing high above Ichigo. He watched as Ichigo forced his foot down, making a barrier under his foot, grinding it down. He smiled, satisfied that he had obliterated Jinta. He held up his hand and said, \"Sin of Envy! Absorb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was attempting to absorb the powers Jinta had. By destroying his body, the power had to go somewhere. Ichigo was going to absorb it, enter the Spirit King's realm and collect Renji and Hitsugaya. Then, he could go about setting things right again. This whole nightmare would finally, FINALLY, be over. Unfortunately for him, he had no idea that he had completely failed in killing Jinta. The red haired boy snickered as he watched Ichigo. Now it was time for him to get the drop on Ichigo and take him out. He cracked his knuckles and began to grow. In space, he cast no shadow so as he grew and grew and grew without Ichigo noticing. He suppressed his Spiritual Pressure, wanting to hide himself until the right moment. Ichigo was becoming less and less to him, his body becoming a speck, then less than a speck. Jinta finally believed he had grown enough and let his Spiritual Pressure flow out. Ichigo was floored by it, unable to move. Jinta spoke a single command. \"Come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's tiny body was bound by Jinta's words. He rose up before Jinta's face, staring into the eye of one who would definitely, surely, kill him. Jinta smirked and said, \"ONCE A SLAVE, ALWAYS A SLAVE CARROT TOP! NOW...THE ONLY QUESTION IS, HOW DO I DEAL WITH YOU?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo simply floated there in front of God\u2019s giant eye. He couldn\u2019t speak nor could he even think; as if his mind couldn\u2019t comprehend the sudden change in the situation. Why was Jinta still alive? Why wasn\u2019t he a stain on the bottom of his foot? Why was he so massive?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLOOK AR YOU, CARROT TOP.\u201d Jinta\u2019s booming voice spoke; Ichigo couldn\u2019t even tell where it was coming from. Jinta moved to pinch Ichigo between two of his fingers. Ichigo watched as two gigantic walls of peach-colored flesh appeared on either side of him. Slowly the walls came together until Ichigo was compressed between them. It was amazing how, despite the immeasurable size difference between them, Jinta could still hold Ichigo between his fingers without popping him. \u201cYOU\u2019RE EVEN SMALLER THAN YOU WERE <b>BEFORE</b> YOU TURNED INTO THE ORANGE HULK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-h-how\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHOW? DON\u2019T ASK SUCH A STUPID QUESTION, CARROT TOP. I JUST SLIPPED PAST YOU AND GREW UNNOTICED. YOU NEVER EVEN NOTICED ME BEHIND YOU.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo didn\u2019t understand. How did Jinta travel from under his foot to behind him in such a short time? The answer hit Ichigo like a ton of (solar system sized) bricks; Jinta\u2019s space tearing ability. His cheap, freaking space tearing ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOW, I\u2019M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO TEACHING YOU A LESSON, SO LET\u2019S FINISH THIS.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he finished saying this, Jinta released Ichigo who began to plummet. How was he plummeting downward in the middle of space? Jinta was using his gravity powers, of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be happening!\u201d Ichigo shouted as he fell. \u201cI refuse to lose to this brat after all that work!\u201d Ichigo reared back his fists and unleashed a barrage of Treachery punches upon Jinta\u2019s chin. These punches, which had defeated his Hollow self, didn\u2019t even register with Jinta. Ichigo wasn\u2019t going to give up, however, and wrapped his fists with Flames of Wrath as he passed Jinta\u2019s humongous chest. He began to beat on the god\u2019s left pectoral, unleashing one devastating punch after another. After ten of these destructive blows, the only thing Jinta did in response was scratch an itch on his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No, no, no, no, no! Why won\u2019t you just DIE?!\u201d Sin of Lust! Pull!!\u201d Ichigo summoned countless planets and stars and threw them all toward Jinta. Unfortunately, even the largest celestial object was smaller than a grain of salt to Jinta now. Those planets and stars never made it close to the Spirit King and were blown apart by his unmatched spiritual pressure. Jinta brought his hand to his mouth and yawned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFIGURES. YOU LOSE YOUR ADVANTAGE AND YOU TURN INTO A WHINY CRY BABY. I\u2019M REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU, CARROT TOP.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta moved that same hand downward and used his power of creation to form a brand new planet at his feet. This planet was the second biggest thing in the universe, being roughly half Jinta\u2019s current size. When Ichigo turned around and saw it, he wondered how something like that could appear so suddenly. When the Hell King looked back up at the red headed brat, he saw him lift his foot over the planet\u2026and him. Their roles were now reversed and Ichigo didn\u2019t have any cheap space tearing powers\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSEE YOU SOON, CARROT TOP.\u201d Jinta spoke before he brought his foot down upon Ichigo. The Devil incarnate tried to think of some way out of this, but came up with nothing. He had so many abilities, but all of them were useless before the mega god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta sole hit Ichigo like a flyswatter hitting a fly. Most of his muscular body was crushed upon impact, but he remained alive. Jinta\u2019s bare foot descended into the planet\u2019s atmosphere and Ichigo\u2019s body burst into flames. He howled in agony as his broken body began to burn turn a charcoal color. He was close to the planet\u2019s surface non, but still the Hell king clung to life. Once his consciousness vanished\u2026that\u2019s when the real horror began. Death wasn\u2019t the end\u2026not by a long shot. Jinta would revive him, good as new, and punish him for his betrayal. He never stood a chance against Jinta\u2026and now he was fucked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJJJJJJIIIIIIIIINNNNNNTTTTTAAAAAAA!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red haired titan\u2019s foot impacted the planet, tearing a hole in it and smashing through layer after layer. Jinta closed his eyes and sighed as he felt every rock under his foot split and crunch. Most of all, he felt the crisp remains of Ichigo flatten and get pushed into the planet\u2019s inner magma. Just like that, the Hell King was gone\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026sort of. Jinta still needed to get rid of that foul smelling spiritual energy. He tugged his foot out of the planet and replaced it with his hand. He quickly drew in the Hell King\u2019s power, which had been crammed into the very core of the planet. Jinta also absorbed the life energy of the planet and used it to restore his body. The cuts and bruises on his face disappeared, his lost teeth reformed, and his smoothed out abdominals returned to their former, perfect glory. In a mere minute, Jinta appeared as if he had never suffered any injuries at all. As for the Hell King\u2019s power, it was tossed into the vortex of Jinta\u2019s spiritual pressure, lost and consumed. It would never be used again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sucking the planet dry, Jinta backhanded the sphere and watched it dissipate into space dust. The remnants of the dead planet scattered through the cosmos, and Jinta took notice of the fact that his fight with Ichigo had practically turned several light-years of space into an empty void. Perhaps he would come back here in the future to fill it back up\u2026if he ever got bored. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jinta cracked his knuckles and sighed, putting his arms behind his head. Finally, it was over. Ichigo had never been a legitimate threat, just a minor annoyance that had lasted longer than he should have. Jinta had never questioned his dominance over the Substitute Soul Reaper, not even when it looked like he would be crushed. He had faced so many threats to his dominance he had gotten used to upstarts who think they're stronger than him. Well, now no such being existed. Jinta was free to rule over the universe has the true God. He grinned as he looked around. All the stars, planets, galaxies, black holes, quasars, comets, and all other celestial bodies were his to do with as he willed. He could destroy this entire universe and easily recreate it, or build a new one in its place. He was in total command and now absolutely nothing could stop him. He knew Kisuke was still alive somewhere, but why bother worrying about him? He had lost in his gamble. There was no way he could do anything to match him. He could create slime for the rest of his pathetic life but Jinta's powers were ever growing. He would continue to grow more powerful, stronger, faster, better, and he would never be matched. The power of the Hell King was the last threat to his dominance and he had dominated it with his Spiritual Pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the Hell King's power, it was time for carrot top to get what was coming to him! Jinta grinned wickedly as he imagined the coming tortures. He was going to make Ichigo suffer greatly for daring to fight against him. He stretched and popped out of existence, instantly reappearing back inside his realm. He calmly pulled out a can of soda and began to drink it. His slaves had instantly moved to the edge of his throne and bowed down, prostrating themselves instantly before their God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Jinta! We're so glad you've returned!\" Hisagi said devotedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dispatched whatever it was that was out there as swiftly as we knew you would!\" Hitsugaya said with passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta finished drinking the cola and smashed the can in his hand. He grinned and said, \"You know it snowball! He never stood a chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was it Lord, if I may ask?\" Hitsugaya asked, not looking up at Jinta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta laughed and said, \"It was carrot top all right. He got the Hell King's power and tried to stand up to me. I put him in his place!\" He smashed his fist against his open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two slaves cheered and said, \"Good work Lord Jinta! Your power is unlimited! No one can stand up to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta crossed his arms and just took in the praise. \"And now...I'm going to punish him for what he's done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi looked confused and said, \"Do you have him here Lord Jinta?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta snorted and said, \"Get real sixty nine face! I crushed him into paste a thousand times over! I'm going to bring him back right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi cringed and said, \"Yes my Lord! Sorry my Lord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta made a waving gesture with his hand and said, \"Don't worry about it. Just enjoy the show you two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi and Hitsugaya eagerly sat back and watched, enraptured as Jinta held out his hand, a glow emanating from it. Within seconds Ichigo appeared on the floor before Jinta, his normal human size. He glared up at Jinta with a look of pure venomous hatred. He had been expecting this, his return to the World of the Living. Jinta put his hands on his hips and smirked down at Ichigo. \"Well, well, well....Here we are again carrot top! You rose from the position of slave speck to false god speck. But now you're finally back down where you belong. Under my foot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed his foot down on Ichigo, instantly crushing half of his body. Ichigo gritted his teeth in pain and coughed up blood, slowly dieing already. Jinta laughed and said, \"This is so cool! I can torture you all I want and it doesn't matter how broken or battered you get! Because I can just do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's body suddenly reformed itself, the pain staying inside of him, but now 100% healed. He got to his feet and muttered. \"You bastard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled forward and defiantly punched Jinta's toe. It obviously didn't register to the red haired god but it amused Jinta. \"This is just like old times, eh carrot top? Back before my true ascension, when you were so sure you could escape and take me down, or hoping that your friends could help you. I'm really going to enjoy breaking you down again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo spat on Jinta's toe and shouted, \"Fuck you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta pushed the toe down on top of Ichigo and wiped it across his tiny body. It came apart like a rotten piece of wood. Within minutes, Ichigo had bled out, leaving nothing but a bunch of bloody pieces. Jinta smirked and, once again, the body reformed. Ichigo coughed and winced, the pain and memories still inside his head. Jinta gestured with his finger and Ichigo's body flew upward, the gravity for him reversing. When he was level with the giant god's abs Jinta said, \"Remember your second imprisonment? My good old belly button! You spent quite a bit of time in there, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's eye twitched as he remembered being folded up inside of the sweaty fleshy cave. He flew up past it and stopped around Jinta's chest. \"And, of course, prison number one! You made a crappy necklace carrot top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe floated up even higher, over to Jinta's ear. \"I'm sure you remember prison three! After I found you crammed inside my navel you became my second accessory in my line of Soul Reaper jewelry! Sixty nine face was number three, but now he's just my obedient slave. You'll be there again soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo floated over to the side and was soon before Jinta's face. Jinta grinned and said, \"Now, remember where your sword went?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta licked his lips as Ichigo remembered watching this behemoth swallow it down his throat. He knew where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little trip will be good for you. I hope you enjoy having your body dissolved by my far superior body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta's mouth opened wide, strings of saliva clinging to his pearly white, perfectly aligned teeth. Ichigo floated serenely forward and landed with a wet plop on the massive tongue, his gravity returning to normal. Almost instantly he was covered in the thick saliva, his body weighed down by the sheer amount of it. Jinta flicked his tongue and Ichigo was tossed about, slamming into teeth, the upper palate, crushed underneath the tongue, and smashed into the uvula before he slipped down Jinta's throat, the muscles massaging his body as he was forced downward, the end of his trail suddenly widening so he fall face first in a pile of muck. He sat up and whipped his head from side to side, the bodily fluids flying left and right. A deep, booming sound echoed deep within Jinta's body and Ichigo realized the twerp was laughing at him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it feel in there carrot top? Nice and warm? You were barely a snack! I give ya about ten more seconds to live before my perfect body starts breaking you down. It's sure to be painful! Remember, when you're ready to submit, the pain will stop and you'll be my loyal little slave again! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly the digestive juices began to work on Ichigo's body, the flesh burning and turning an ugly red color before being stripped away completely. Ichigo howled in pain, his bones dissolving into paste. A normal human's digestive juices wouldn't be able to dissolve something like Ichigo so quickly but Jinta's digestive system was a work of art. Ichigo was soon deader than dust, his body already being used to fuel Jinta...not that he needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta burped a little and said, \"Alright, let's move on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo reformed once more, a haunted look already appearing in his eyes. The torture was already starting take it's toll.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo had reformed down by Jinta\u2019s titanic feet. The young god looked down at the orange haired bug from high on his throne, grinning with amusement. What should he do to him next? Put him between his toes and make toe jam out of him? Crush each one of his limbs and watch him bleed to death? There were so many ways to torture his teenage slave. Eventually, Jinta decided to make Ichigo offer him service. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen up, carrot top,\u201d Jinta boomed as he raised his foot over the tiny bug. Ichigo thought he was about to be stomped and braced himself for another humiliating and pointless death. However, Jinta just kept the foot hovering over him. \u201cI want a foot rub. That\u2019s not so bad, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m not your slave!\u201d Ichigo shouted, his haunted eyes still carrying a bit of free will in then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Well, I guess I\u2019ll just go back to killing you. I WAS going to end the torture if you gave me a good foot massage\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo\u2019s eyes widened as he screamed, \u201cWAIT! I changed my mind; I\u2019ll rub them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, good boy. Do a good job and maybe I\u2019ll even release you from your enslavement.\u201d Jinta said as he watched Ichigo approach his sole and start rubbing. Jinta\u2019s feet had gotten really sweaty during their battle and Ichigo felt his hands tingle as they were soaked to the bone with the teen\u2019s heavy sweat. As Jinta enjoyed watching Ichigo humiliate himself, his eyes glanced over at Hitsugaya and Hisagi. \u201cHey, you two! I have another foot over here, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Right, Lord Jinta!\u201d Hisagi said as he and the former captain ran past Ichigo and began working on Jinta\u2019s other foot. Jinta smiled and relaxed back in his throne. While Ichigo was clearly sickened by Jinta\u2019s smelly feet, his two fellow slaves were the complete opposite. They enjoyed every second of rubbing their master\u2019s feet and only wished they had the stamina to do it for eternity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile, Jinta looked down at Hisagi and Toshiro and said, \u201cGood job, boys. As a reward, why don\u2019y you kiss my feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, Lord Jinta? Thank you!!\u201d the snow haired slave praised as he and Hisagi began pecking their master\u2019s sole with kisses. To them, the foot of their god was better than any partner they could of had in their old life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for you,\u201d Jinta looked down at Ichigo, who was still rubbing his foot. With a wicked grin, Jinta began lowering his foot and forcing Ichigo onto his back. His sweaty sole soon covered him and he started to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-What are you doing?!\u201d Ichigo shouts as he tries hopelessly to push the giant\u2019s foot off him. \u201cI thought we had a deal?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilly bug; God doesn\u2019t make deals! Besides, you did a sucky job on my foot. You deserve only punishment, carrot top.\u201d Jinta chuckled loudly as he slowly pressed down on the screaming Ichigo. His two obedient slaves resisted the urge to look at Ichigo and only listened as his screams as they were put to an end with a soft crunch. Jinta started to hum as he pivoted his foot, smearing Ichigo over his sole.             <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo reformed again, this time on Jinta throne\u2026right in front of the god\u2019s balls. Ichigo stared up at Jinta\u2019s towering length, which had become somewhat stiff after feeling him crunch under his foot. Jinta grinned toothily down at Ichigo and said, \u201cYou did a bad job on my feet, so how about rubbing my balls? They want some attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo started to back away from Jinta\u2019s massive sex organs, but Jinta simply moved his hand behind the bug and pushed him face-first into his sweaty ball sack. Ichigo screamed as the hand threatened to squish him against the soft flesh, but Jinta thankfully let up on the pressure before that happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRub, carrot top!\u201d Jinta commanded. His voice had given him an order, and Ichigo found himself unable to refuse. He pulled himself off the teen\u2019s skin and started rubbing with all his strength. He didn\u2019t want to do this, but Jinta\u2019s power of command was too great. He was pleasing Jinta whether he liked it or not\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026at least that\u2019s what he thought, until he looked up at Jinta and noticed the unfortunate truth. The red head was staring down at him with a disappointed expression and his cock was starting to soften. He was failing miserably to arouse him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat the best you got, Ichigo?\u201d Jinta asked. \u201cI can\u2019t even feel you.\u201d Jinta sighed with displeasure as he lifted himself a few inches off the throne. Ichigo watched the ball sack he had been rubbing rise up. The Spirit King adjusted his position to that Ichigo was right under his balls before sitting back down. Ichigo whimpered as the fleshy texture of Jinta\u2019s two globes consumed him, covering him in sticky flesh. Jinta smiled as he felt Ichigo squirm under him. \u201cThat\u2019s much better\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo\u2026too heavy!\u201d Ichigo cried as Jinta\u2019s balls started to compress him into the throne. Jinta heard Ichigo\u2019s whimper and it amused him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Too heavy? Come on, carrot top, don\u2019t be a wuss! Are you really going to get crushed under my BALLS?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon saying that, Ichigo\u2019s body gave and smeared out under Jinta\u2019s sack. The teen god wasn\u2019t even trying to kill him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just pathetic.\u201d Jinta muttered as he adjusted himself again. With another thought, Ichigo reformed at the tip of his penis. The haunting look in the former high school student\u2019s eyes had gotten worse. He stared up past Jinta\u2019s godly body to his handsome face. When was this going to end? \u201cRub my cock, carrot top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo only now realized where he was. A tear fell from his eye as he started to come to terms with how much he had been reduced. Once he was proud teenager living a not-so-normal life, but now he was a bug at the tip of a giant dick. What had he done to deserve this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo started rubbing Jinta cock head, the action immediately registering with him. Jinta felt is dick harden until it was sticking up like a spear. He closed his eyes and concentrated on the feeling of Ichigo\u2019s hands on his hot flesh. Back on the ground, Shuhei and Toshiro were staring up at their master. His face told them he was enjoying himself, but they wished they were the ones that were making him feel this way. For now, all they could do was attend to themselves. Listening to this god make those sounds of joy while getting such a great view of his hot body\u2026the two males couldn\u2019t help but reaching into their pants and take out their own erections. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta\u2019s pleasure trip couldn\u2019t last. The god knew Ichigo would run out of strength before he came. In order to speed things up, Jinta took hold of his mighty rod and began stroking it. The sudden movement of his cock made Ichigo lose his balance and fall right over Jinta\u2019s slit. The former hero had just seconds to notice the rumbling beneath him before Jinta exploded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhhhh\u2026\u201d Jinta sighed with content as he released a torrent of man juice from his organ. Ichigo was jettisoned off his cock head and trapped in a big glob of white stuff. Hisagi and Toshiro, who had just finished their own climaxes, noticed the white rain that was about to fall. Without having the chance to fix their pants, the two males ran to dodge the globs of cum. At that size, just one drop of that stuff could probably break their necks. When Jinta finished, he rested his head against the back of his throne and glanced down at the floor. He almost immediately spotted a small pool of his cum that was moving. Ichigo had become trapped in it and the fall had broken several of his bones. He was unable to escape to freedom and Jinta watched as the movement slowly came to a halt. Ichigo had drowned in his semen\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta summoned Ichigo\u2019s cum drenched corpse onto his palm and breathed life into it once more. The teen instantly began spluttering and choking, Jinta\u2019s spunk still being in his mouth and throat. When he had recovered, he remained in a fetal position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was fun, wasn\u2019t it, carrot top? What should we do next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026no more.\u201d Ichigo begged, trembling in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? No more? Are you saying you\u2019re giving yourself to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I won\u2019t\u2026I won\u2019t be your slave!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re not making any sense, carrot top. If you want the torture to stop, you gotta surrender yourself to me. There\u2019s no other way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo felt like he was going insane. While Jinta was healing every injury he was sustaining to his body, his mental state was forever scarred. His mind was telling him two different things at once. One side told him he couldn\u2019t take much more of this, while the other told him that giving himself to Jinta was the wrong choice to make. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo battled back and forth in his mind, not knowing what to do. He held his head and fell to his knees, covered in Jinta's cum with the fingers slowly curling around him, ready to crush him again and continue this hellish torture. Something in his mind suddenly clicked. He remembered doing this before. He had gotten down on his hands and knees, had kissed and licked, rubbed and massaged, had devoted himself completely to this arrogant teen god. And...he had enjoyed it. He had been happy. Best of all, Jinta had actually been nice to him and had praised him for his work. He had been the most devoted of his slaves. He remembered everything he had been through. That life, the almost normal life of a teenage high school student, was impossible now. It was a dead dream. There was only Jinta now and if Ichigo wanted anything other than a life of nothing but endless death and destruction at the increasingly cruel hands of this boy, he would have to submit. He wasn't entirely sure if this was the right thing to do or if he'd be able to keep it up but it really his only option. He looked up, his face impassive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta's fingers stopped closing around him just as his middle finger was brushing against Ichigo's orange hair. He saw him looking up and smiled. \"Well carrot top? Got something to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded and got to his feet. He looked up into Jinta's godly eye and shouted, \"I SUBMIT LORD JINTA! I'VE BEEN A FOOL TO THINK THAT I COULD STAND AGAINST YOU! I'VE DESERVED EVERY DEATH AND PUNISHMENT YOU'VE GIVEN ME! PLEASE FORGIVE ME, EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT WORTHY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta smirked and said, \"Atta boy carrot top! It's about time you learned your place again! It was a lot easier this time. Then again, I'm a lot bigger and a LOT more powerful than I once was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and the cum drained off of Ichigo, leaving him totally nude, but clean, in Jinta's palm. \"I guess I could give you some clothes...but you don't need them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped Ichigo down next to Toshiro and Hisagi who looked warily at Ichigo. Ichigo smiled a little sheepishly and said, \"Hey guys...I'm back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya looked coldly at Ichigo and said, \"What were you thinking Kurosaki? Did you really think you'd stand a chance against Lord Jinta?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I always knew you were reckless and kind of an idiot but this is beyond ridiculous!\" Hisagi chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo sighed and said, \"You guys, it's not like I wanted to! Urahara messed with my head and clouded my judgment. I went back to thinking about who I was before Lord Jinta ascended. Remember what that was like? Imagine having all your devotion and love ripped away in a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth slaves shuddered and Toshiro said, \"No...I can't imagine it and I don't want to imagine it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either. I'd rather kill myself!\" Hisagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta chuckled and said, \"You three are so cute. It's good to have you all back in your place...serving me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed at Ichigo and said menacingly, \"But listen up Ichigo! You were my number one for awhile but after that little rebellion you tried to pull you're on the bottom! You're going to have to make your way to the top again, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded and fell to his knees. \"Yes Lord Jinta! I will make you proud of me once more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta nodded, his head resting against one hand. \"Yeah, yeah, talk is dirt cheap carrot top. You'd better prove it without a doubt in my mind. Snowball down there is my current number one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro looked proud while Hisagi looked disappointed. Jinta noticed and said, \"Don't like it sixty nine face? Then you'd better shape up and perform better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisagi jumped and nodded. \"Yes Lord Jinta! I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta called all his slaves into his hand and held them up to his eye. \"Look around you specks. This is the first day of the rest of eternity. And we're going to have some FUN!\"</span></div></div>",

His snoring filled the halls of the realm and was enough to keep an entire planet awake, yet it didn\u2019t seem to bother the boy\u2019s three slaves. The sound finally ended when Jinta\u2019s eyes fluttered open and he was brought back to consciousness. The teenaged god stretched his large arms into the air and yawned loudly. Before sitting up, Jinta glanced down at his expansive body and looked for his three servants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitsugaya was sleeping on his left pec, snuggled up against the pink nipple. Ichigo was inside his navel, since it had recently become a favorite of his. On the tip of his glorious cock was Hisagi. How many times did Jinta tell him that it was dangerous to sleep there? You\u2019d think he\u2019d realize this by now after he had accidentally rolled down into the slit a couple weeks back. Jinta was about to scold the black haired man when it dawned on the giant that he was erect. Looks like he had some morning wood to take care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026I feel like starting the day with a little <i>exercise</i>. Who should help me this time?\u201d Jinta pondered as he glanced from one slave to the next. His eyes finally rested on Hitsugaya. He had done it with him a few nights ago, but he was just so much better than the other two combined. Kind of ironic, since he was also the youngest looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta levitated Hisagi and Ichigo off his form and placed them on the floor somewhere. He then focused his power into Hitsugaya and watched the white haired teen quickly grow until he was just a bit smaller than himself. The sensation of growth that woken Toshiro, who rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and looked his god in the face. You\u2019d think he\u2019s be surprised by the change in size, but this had happened countless times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord Jinta? Didn\u2019t we already\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, Snowy, but I never get tired of you.\u201d Jinta said before he grabbed the back of his slave\u2019s head and forced him into a kiss. Hitsugaya\u2019s sleepiness melted away as he wrapped his arms around his master\u2019s neck and kissed back. As the two made out, Jinta\u2019s finger tips glided over Hitsugaya\u2019s body and touched him all over. He and Hisagi had long since abandoned their clothes like Ichigo, since there was no need for them. It wasn\u2019t like they needed to hide anything. Hitsugaya\u2019s years of service had worked his body hard; he was beginning to look almost as good as when he was a god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen two separated so Toshiro could breath, Jinta moved down to his slave\u2019s neck and starting giving him little bites. Hitsugaya moaned and strengthened his hold on Jinta. The Spirit King finished teasing Hitsugaya and, using his much larger muscles, easily flipped him over so he was lying down on him. Hitsugaya started at his god with lust filled eyes while Jinta just smirked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready, Snowy?\u201d Jinta asked as he gently stroked his servant\u2019s white hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m always ready, Lord Jinta.\u201d Hitsugaya answered with a smile. Moments later, the palace was once again filled with noise. This time is was the sound of erotic grunts and moans\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nA half hour later, Jinta waltzed into his throne room with his three slaves on his shoulder. He took a seat on his throne and dropped the three teens onto the floor. While none of them could be called Soul Reapers any longer, they still possessed the basic abilities of one. This allowed them to touch down safely without injuring themselves. Once their feet were resting on the ground, Hitsugaya was forced to kneel since a certain area of his was in intense pain\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s on the agenda today?\u201d Jinta asked as he rested his arms on the throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Lord Jinta,\u201d Hisagi began. \u201cIf I remember correctly, today is the day the planet of Scree promised to have a statue of you erected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScree?\u201d Jinta racked his brain as he tried to remember who they were again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the planet you saved from a meteorite, Lord Jinta. It was about three weeks ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right! You mean the planet I \u201csaved\u201d from the meteorite. All I did was sneeze\u2026\u201d Jinta chuckled before he raised one of his hands and summoned the planet of Scree into his throne room. He couldn\u2019t be bothered to go there himself, so he just made the planet come to him instead. Once the planet was hovering in front of him, Jinta waved his hand again and spun the planet around. \u201cNow, let\u2019s see, where was the capital again? \u2026ahh, here!\u201d Jinta stopped the planet so his eyes were looking down at the capital city. He peered into the planet closely and saw every citizen of the planet gathered around some structure. They were all waving at him; their savior. When Jinta looked at the statue they were surrounding\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d Jinta immediately asked, his eyes glaring at the population of Scree. \u201cThat statue doesn\u2019t look anything like me! My eyes are too far apart and my muscles are WAY more defined then that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-please forgive us!\u201d Jinta heard a voice say. It was probably the leader of the planet, who was staring up at him with fear. The rest of the citizens had also changed their expressions from joy into pure terror. \u201cLet us make another statue! We promise to correct our mistakes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope! Your god is insulted, but I\u2019ll still let you reward me in a different way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026what is it that you wish, sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta grinned evilly and moved his hand down to his stomach. \u201cBreakfast.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMoving the hand over the planet, Jinta shrank it down until it was a mere golf ball to him. He then took a single finger and pushed the miniature planet toward his mouth. The citizens of Scree could only watch as their new god opened his maw wide and pushed their home into his wet cavern. Jinta shut his mouth and rolled the planet around on his tongue. The entire surface of the planet was decimated by his pink muscle and drenched with acidic saliva. Once Jinta had tasted enough of the sphere, he tilted his head back and gulp loudly. Ichigo, Hisagi, and Hitsugaya watched as the planet made a lump in Jinta throat as it was pushed down by the strong muscles for its trip into his boiling stomach. Once he felt his meal drop into his gut, Jinta rubbed his abs happily and burped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was filling.\u201d Jinta commented before relaxing both his arms behind his head and sticking both his feet out. Without needing to say anything, his three slaves knew what it was time for. They quickly flew over to the god\u2019s soles and began licking them. This was their breakfast; the foot sweat of Jinta himself. The three males consumed it like it was the most delicious thing in existence. They needed to thank their god for this gift, so they eagerly rubbed the sole they were licking. After one hundred years of practice, they had become experts had rubbing the feet of God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, carrot top, toss it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of worship, Jinta brought his slaves into the depths of space for a friendly game he liked to call \u201cGalactic Ball\u201d. Today, the game was being played in the middle of the planetary system known as the Delta System. It was dubbed this by the highly advanced race known as the Durans. The Durans, who appear very similar to humans, live on the planet Axis Mundi. This planet is currently in the hands of a certain carrot topped human being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mega giant Ichigo, who had been grown by Jinta for this game, held Axis Mundi in his hands and prepared to throw it to his master. The giant slave believed the surface of the planet had already been smoothed out by his hands, but this was not so. Just before he snatched it out of its orbit, the Durans activated a force field around their planet that protected it from harm. Ichigo was completely unaware of the force field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere it comes!\u201d Ichigo exclaims before rearing back and throwing the planet with all his strength. The planet zipped through the Delta System and spiraled toward Jinta, who was ready for it with a bat in his hands. Just before the planet passed him, the red haired deity whacked it with the bat. The Duran race saw their shield crack from the blow, but that was all. The force field withstood the blow that should of decimated their planet and Axis Mundi was sent flying further into their planetary system. This was an unexpected event for the Duran race, but they did not believe it was the end of them. The giants had greatly underestimated them, for they possessed the necessary technology to send their planet back to its original position like nothing had ever happened. They were going to be fine\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s heading for that star!\u201d Toshiro shouted from Jinta shoulder, watching as the planet flew through space toward this system\u2019s sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Duran\u2019s even noticed, the heat from their sun ignited the force field and set the sky ablaze. Still the powerful shield held and the sphere of fire rocketed right into the star. As Axis Mundi sunk past the Chromosphere, the force field finally collapsed and the Durans were disintegrated from the pages of history. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, awesome!\u201d Jinta swung his bat over his shoulder and watched his \u2018ball\u2019 disappear into the sphere of fire. \u201cThat has to be at least three-thousand points!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat shot, Lord Jinta!\u201d Ichigo praised. \u201cShall we continue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! There are still a bunch of balls left!\u201d Jinta replied as he grabbed a nearby planet, tossed it up, and hit it with his bat. The planet was crippled by the blow and what remained of it flew into the distance. For the next hour or so, each one of Jinta\u2019s slaves were given the chance to toss planets for him to hit. The Spirit King whacked each one perfectly and sent them flying into other space objects, into a star, or right out of their galaxy. After the last planet of the Delta System was gone, Jinta tossed his bat into a portal for later use and relaxed back in the empty space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, that was easy! I haven\u2019t even broken a sweat yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we travel elsewhere and find more planets to use, master?\u201d Toshiro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, that\u2019s enough of this game for now. I really want to work up a sweat!\u201d Jinta thought for a moment and an idea popped into his head. \u201cI know! Let\u2019s visit my personal torture chamber! It\u2019s REALLY hot there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded when he heard this. He knew full when what his lord\u2019s torture chamber was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026it was the realm of Hell itself. After the Hell King was defeated and his power absorbed by Jinta, the red headed god was able to enter and manipulate Hell as he wished. It, like everywhere else in the universe, was his domain. It was here that Jinta imprisoned those that had wronged him and put them through an endless cycle of torment. His list of victims include Grimmjow, Aizen, Legion, Renji, and all the other Soul Reapers (he had banished them all here so he could keep his \u2018enemies\u2019 in one place). The torture they were forced to endure included full body worship to their god, suffering under the teen\u2019s spiritual pressure until it crushed them, being consumed and revived in the stomach so they were digested again and again, plus much, much more. Jinta would even shrink some of them to germ size and let his slaves have their way with them. There was nothing worse than being tortured by someone who was supposed to be a bug. That is, unless you were the Infinity Corps. Those four were at the top of Jinta\u2019s list and their torment was truly nightmarish. How bad was it? Well\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHE USED ME AS A FUCKING <b>CONDOM</b>!!!\u201d screamed one of the clones just after reforming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was you?\u201d asked a second clone. The two white haired Arrancars stared at each other before they both broke down into tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta\u2019s life as God was good, but what about his three servants? Shortly after the Hell King incident they were each given immortality by Jinta so that they could serve him eternally. They never aged and never sickened. They could still die, as they did many times due to accidents or because Jinta felt like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three slaves were also allowed to go down to Earth every now and then. They hated being away from their god for even a minute, but Jinta insisted. He needed them to go down there so they could spread his word among the mortals. They needed to know that he was their god and they belonged to him. It didn\u2019t take long before the three former Soul Reapers became celebrities and were given the titles \u201cGod\u2019s Angels\u201d. They refused the titles at first, saying they were just bugs like everyone else, but it eventually stuck. Through their words the planet was forever changed. All religions were abolished and Jinta became the one and only deity worshipped by all. Who would deny the existence of a god they knew was real?  Statues of Jinta were erected across the planet, replacing famous monuments like the Statue or Liberty or The Great Buddha. Books were written detailing Jinta\u2019s battles on Earth and beyond the stars. An American baseball team was even formed in honor of Jinta called the Red Batters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular day, Ichigo was sent down to the United States while Jinta spent some \u201cquality time\u201d with the residents of Hell. He was inside a local burger joint, dressed in casual clothes since the humans insisted he wore clothes when he was on Earth. Something about protecting the children\u2019s innocence. Ichigo thought it was funny, since they never complained when Jinta decided to jack off outside a city and watch it drown in his cum just for fun.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you carrot top?!\u201d asked a child-like voice. Ichigo looked up from his burger to see a young boy, around ten or so, staring back at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d he replied with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow! You\u2019re one of Lord Jinta\u2019s three Angels! I\u2019m a big fan of his! Is it true he used to be a normal kid like me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, along time ago. I don\u2019t like to remember those days, but I used to know him back then too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s so cool! I used to wish I could be big and strong like Lord Jinta, but my parents said it was wrong to wish that. So instead I want to grow up to be like you! Being around God all day and serving him up close\u2026I wish I could be one of his Angels someday!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, well I\u2019ll put in a good word for you, okay kid?\u201d Ichigo replied, his words making the boy\u2019s smile even larger. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name? It\u2019s\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the boy could answer, the two of them felt the ground rumble. Booming footsteps could be heard outside and Ichigo saw a giant bare foot appear outside. The next thing he knew, the roof of the burger joint was being torn off. Once it was tossed off, Jinta squatted down and peered into the restaurant. The god had shrunk himself down like he usually does when he wants to have fun on Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are, carrot top! I\u2019ve been looking for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies, Lord Jinta! I didn\u2019t think you were expecting me back so soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that. Something\u2019s come up.\u201d Jinta said as he reached down into the restaurant and grabbed Ichigo by the back of his shirt. The American boy watched as Ichigo was plucked right out of the burger joint and deposited onto Jinta shoulder. With that, Jinta stepped over the restaurant and left the speechless boy alone in the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s happened, Lord Jinta?\u201d Ichigo asked, looking up at his god\u2019s face. His answer did not come from him, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Kisuke.\u201d Hisagi said from behind Ichigo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKisuke? I haven\u2019t heard that name in years\u2026\u201d Ichigo replied, curious as to what exactly that man was up to now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe attacked the palace and has challenged Lord Jinta.\u201d came Hitsugaya\u2019s voice. Ichigo didn\u2019t know where it came from until he looked up and saw the white haired teen poking out of Jinta\u2019s red hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s he get into the place? I thought Lord Jinta made it so the King\u2019s Key wouldn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s that slime of his,\u201d Hisagi said, rolling his eyes. \u201cApparently, he\u2019s spent the last 100 years perfecting it into its ultimate form. He used it on himself and now\u2026well I didn\u2019t even recognize him when he appeared before us in Hell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now the piece of trash wants to have a bout in the middle of MY universe!\u201d Jinta exclaimed, slamming his fist into his palm. \u201cHe should of just stayed in hiding, because now I\u2019m going step on all his hard work and give him a one-way trip to Hell!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a doubt in my mind you can do it, Lord Jinta! You\u2019re the most powerful being in existence!\u201d Ichigo replied, making Jinta glance at him and grin. No matter how many times it was said, Jinta loved hearing it. It was the flawless and undeniable truth. \u201cSo\u2026if Kisuke has challenged you in space, why are we still on Earth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ichigo asked this, Jinta stopped at the edge of a baseball stadium. The seats were packed with people from across the globe, since today was the day the Red Batters played their first game. Unfortunately, they were doing terrible and Jinta was not pleased. The muscular, looming god licked his lips and grinned into the stadium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLunch.\u201d</span></div></div>",

On Earth he was considered the most powerful being in existence, or at least on the planet. On Earth his miles+ tall slave stood as a speck on his shoulder, while Jinta stood thousands of miles tall. None of this mattered in the Spirit King\u2019s realm though, since the thousands-of-miles-tall was the size of the Spirit King\u2019s toenail. Not even the big toenail, but one of the smaller nails. This was a being who over two million miles tall, while only being at 30% efficiency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Hitsugaya and the other slaves in his grip, it was insane. The Spirit King was terrible to behold, his size absolutely overwhelming them all.

Nothing was limitless, and Jinta was reaching his limits already. He was absolutely exhausted from the growth, giving it all he had drained his energy and it was for naught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta was barely bigger than the Spirt King\u2019s big toe.</span></div></div>",

The police hadn't been able to do anything. The army hadn't been able to do anything. Two major Soul Reapers, even three if he joined in, and a group of minor, probably unseated, Soul Reapers wouldn't stand a chance. When Jinta saw he had sat the fight out and was just waiting for it to be over he might get treated better. At the very least he wouldn't die. He sighed and watched the fight. It was going to be rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed it was. Jinta was an unstoppable force, greater than anything that had come before him. All of Hitsugaya's ice attacks were just shrugged off, Zabimaru might as well have been a fly it was swatted so easily, and the Soul Reapers on the ground alternated between kido which had no effect and sword attacks that were even more useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, is this really the best you can do? The Soul Society's full of nothing but wimps!\" Jinta bellowed stomping a few of the minor Soul Reapers flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this kid made of?\" Renji yelled swinging Zabimaru around again. The giant bone snake bared its fangs and bit down on Jinta's arm. Jinta grabbed it just behind the head and squeezed, crushing many of the links of the snake. Renji reformed it once again and tried tripping the monolithic boy. This failed as well. Jinta merely ripped it off and held the snake in hand. He tugged it and Renji, not expecting this, was pulled from the building he was standing on toward the boy. Jinta quickly grabbed him in his other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try moocher! I don't think you'll need this anymore!\" Jinta said with a malicious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Renji could so much as prepare himself Jinta ripped Zabimaru out of his hands. The snake like zanpaktou twisted in his grip until Jinta put the squeeze on it fully. Pieces of the snake fell down around his feet where they were stomped into dust by Jinta's feet. This took a toll on Renji who disbanded his Bankai. Jinta reached down and picked up the tiny sword that was left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what should I do with your toothpick bug?\" Jinta asked mockingly. \"Oh I know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta tossed the blade into his mouth and swallowed. Renji stared in horror as his only weapon was devoured. Jinta rubbed his belly and smacked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, your little monkey snake was pretty tasty! Now sit tight while I deal with your friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped Renji roughly onto the same building as Ichigo before turning his attention on Hitsugaya. Renji saw Ichigo sitting passively on the building and shouted, \"What are you doing Ichigo?!? Fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo glanced at Renji and said, \"No way. I can't beat that monster. If I tried and failed than he would have killed me. I wouldn't stick around if I was you. He's probably going to kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji spat angrily and said, \"What the hell did he do to you to make you like this? It's disgusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo laughed bitterly and said, \"He might make you his slave too. Then you'd understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this conversation was going on Jinta was finishing off Hitsugaya. No matter how cold or sharp his ice was, no matter how much of it covered the boy, Jinta was always able to break out of it like nothing. Even the boy captain's Bankai had worn itself out attempting to break Jinta. Jinta yawned theatrically as the last petal of Hitsugaya's ice flower shattered, his Bankai disappearing from him. Jinta grabbed the captain roughly and pulled his sword out of his grasp tossing it into his mouth like he did the other. With that done he turned his attention to the remaining Soul Reapers at his feet. He waved bye-bye and stomped the rest of them out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was a fun distraction. Now I have to deal with you two meddlers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta quickly grabbed up Renji, holding him in one hand and Hitsugaya in the other. He smirked down at Ichigo who was just sitting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a good little bug carrot top. I'm going to reward you for staying put...when I can think of something. In the meantime I'm going to deal with these two obstinate insects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded mutely, watching with a twinge of fear at what was about to happen to Renji  and Hitsugaya.</span></div></div>",

Things couldn't get much worse. Then Jinta decided he was bored with just letting Ichigo rub. Without warning the boy slowly lowered his foot until Ichigo looked up and saw the massive appendage coming closer and closer to him. Forgetting about rubbing the foot, Ichigo raised his arms above his head and tried to stop the foot's descent. Unfortunately this just wasn't possible. Ichigo lacked the strength to keep the foot at bay. Within seconds he was on his back fruitlessly pushing against Jinta's rough sole. Jinta just laughed and laughed as he felt his slave's struggles slowly cease until Ichigo was flat against the ground with Jinta's foot fully on top of him. Ichigo was totally covered in Jinta's foot sweat, his hair smearing with it while his clothes quickly became drenched. When he got out of this he was going to burn these clothes and shower for about a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only got worse, however, as the sweat found its way into Ichigo's mouth. Soon he found himself swallowing mouthful after mouthful of Jinta's sweat the taste salty and slightly gritty thanks to all the dirt and rock in the hidden room. Jinta just kept moving his foot back and forth loving the feeling of the tiny teen under his foot. It was amazing, knowing he had such total power over Ichigo. He could do this for hours. Back under the foot, Ichigo was starting to choke on the sweat that entered his mouth. If he didn't find some way to get to the outside air he was done for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt cool air hit his sweat covered face. Opening his eyes and blinking slightly in the sudden brightness Ichigo saw that his head was currently between Jinta's big and second toe. How did that happen? Did Jinta slide his foot off of him? Suddenly he felt his arms get hit by the cooler outside air, followed by his feet. He raised his arm and was shocked to see it slowly expanding. He was growing! But how? Actually, screw how! Ichigo grabbed either side of the foot and lifted. Jinta, who wasn't expecting any resistance, jumped in shock as Ichigo threw the foot aside. Jinta got to his feet as Ichigo did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell? How are you growing?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo grinned evilly up at Jinta whose head was slowly getting closer to his own. He was growing up past Jinta's waist when he punched the kid in the gut. Jinta had been expecting such an attack and tensed his abdominal muscles which absorbed most of the impact. It was still enough to make him stumble back which gave Ichigo ample opportunity to shove him onto his back. Slamming a foot down on his chest Ichigo leered menacingly at Jinta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well looks like the tables are turning little brat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinta felt a spasm of fear cross his face. Surely this couldn't be happening to him? He had only been in charge for a few glorious minutes! It couldn't already be over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, was it?</span></div></div>",

Luckily no one was home, so that meant he could have fun with his little sex toy. He could imagine it now, Jinta exploring his body, going between his pecs and abs, getting trapped in his armpit, playing with his gigantic cock, going inside his anus, playing with his tongue and worshiping his muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went into his room and started to strip until he was only in his underwear. He laid down on his bed, eyeing his humongous bulge. He then started rubbing it and squeezing it, rattling Jinta's dark prison. Suddenly Ichigo's hand peeled his underwear off, flooding Jinta's prison with light. JInta was dizzy and nauseous from the ride, he smelled like Ichigo's cock. He was sweaty from being inside a dark hot and humid place. Ichigo then grabbed his little slave and walked towards the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see his 8 pack abs, his bulging pecs and his large biceps. His cock was erect and was leaking a bit of precum. Jinta was intimidated by the muscular giant, any part of his body could crush him. A single toe could easily pin and crush him, his cock could slam down on him and crush him, his ass could swallow him whole. Ichigo then started to flex him muscles showing of his manliness to the tiny Jinta.<br>\r\n\"Wish you had this didn't you bug\" said Ichigo while flexing his biceps. Jinta felt humiliated, his pride crush and what worse he wasn't even considered a human, to Ichigo he was a bug to use for pleasure. He then brought jinta to his  cock and started rubbing his tiny little body on it, easily coating the little toy with precum and sweat. He was then brought to Ichigo's balls and squeezed it, fondling the giant globes with Jinta in hand. Jinta's whole body was covered by the ballsac.  He then started rubbing the tiny body around his sac making Jinta explore every inch of his sac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that he brought Jinta to his face and opened his mouth. jinta could see the wide mouth, the saliva pooling on the tongue, and the pinkish slimy walls coated with more saliva.<br>\r\nIchigo then brought half of jinta's body inside. His tooth easily dwarfing the size of Jinta's head. He then close his lips around the body and started licking, covering Jinta's upper half with saliva. He then puckered his lips and started sucking while holding onto JInta's legs. Jinta's body was thrust in and out covering almost all of his body with saliva.<br>\r\n\"Shit!, what are you doing carrot top!\" Jinta tried to say but was drowned out because of Ichigo's moans.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmmm, you taste good, like beef, with a hint of cum\" Ichigo moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he pulled Jinta's body out and brought him back to his cock. He set him down and told him to ride his shaft. JInta complied mostly because he was scared of being crushed. Suddenly Jinta's ride was shook up and down. Ichigo was flexing his cock shaking Jinta's ride. Jinta had to grip onto the shaft his body rubbing the shaft, making it harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Ichigo walked back to his bed and layed down with Jinta still griping onto his cock. <br>\r\n\"climb and rub my cock\" Ichigo commanded.<br>\r\nJinta then started to rub his body along Ichigo's shaft his face rubbing on the loose sweaty skin. Precum trickling out of the slit and pouring onto Jinta's body making him slippery. \"Ichigo I can't reach your head I'm too slippery\" shouted Jinta.<br>\r\nIchigo then grabbed Jinta along with his cock and started to rub up and down. Jinta's body being used to get off, the friction giving pleasure to Ichigo. Jinta's was becoming dizzy because of the movement and the smells of Ichigo's cock. He was brought up to the head of Ichigo's cock then back down to the base. Ichigo's hand then started squeezing.<br>\r\n\"Awwww, that hurts! I might be squished if this continues\"<br>\r\nJinta however was also getting rubbed because his dick was being rubbed against Ichigo's hard shaft making him also erect.<br>\r\nIchigo then put Jinta on his slippery cock head.<br>\r\n\"Jinta insert your dick on my slit and hump me'<br>\r\nJinta did as he was told and started to insert his dick on ichigo's slit and started humping. His cock going in and out of the slit, precum gushing out of it. ichigo's hips then started bucking. His hands playing with the cock and his nipples. <br>\r\n\"GONNA CUM!\" they both shouted.<br>\r\nhowever Jinta came first his load going inside Ichigo's slit. Suddenly he felt a rumble and white gold came out. The force propelling him along with the cum to Ichigo's mountainous abs. Plastering him there and coating him with Ichigo's hot cum. A few more loads came out One goign to Ichigo's face and pecs. The last spewed out and trickled down Ichigo's cock coating his balls with a coat of hot cum. Both exhausted, they laid down for awhile. Ichigo then sat up after awhile giving jinta a view of his handsome face and bulging pecs. <br>\r\n\"That was one of the best jack offs, I ever had' said ichigo.<br>\r\nNow where to keep you....</span></div></div>",

He had just returned from practically crushing Ichigo in combat, leaving him a somewhat broken man. He grinned to himself, remembering the adrenaline rush he felt, as he played around with such a pathetic opponent. Oh the sheer joy of batting around that little weakling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, thinking to himself how it could've been even better. He snickered to himself as he compared Ichigo to an insect. How much fun it would be to raise his mighty foot, and bring it down on the puny strawberry... Keep the pressure light... Make him think he can survive it, before bringing it down hard on the tiny man. He'd grind his foot into the ground, making a bloody mess of the little substitute soul reaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he got another idea. How about destroying the little man's hometown before his eyes under his feet, laughing darkly as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... That's what I'd do...\" He said, scratching his chest idly as he kept thinking of devious ways to make the soul reaper miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was doing it, he though of a new idea. \"Hey... That might work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second though, Grimmjow hopped right out of his bed, and opened up a portal to Karakura Town. Jumping right through, he set out on his mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived in the town of Karakura, high above the skies. \"Aw shit, it's still daylight out...\" He groaned. He hopped right out, and set off for lower ground where he could hide more efficiently than in the skies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking left and right, he hid in an alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where's that damned soul reaper's house...?\" He asked himself, peeking around the corner of the alley. He retreated back behind the corner. \"Dammit! I'm getting nowhere at this pace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, someone tossed a box into the alley, and drove off. Grimmjow glanced over. Curious, he walked over to the cardboard cube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the box, it clearly read...</span></div></div>",

Oh no way!\" Grimmjow grinned psychotically, staring at the box before him. \"This is exactly what I was hoping for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ripped the box open revealing dozens and dozens of vials filled with a dark red liquid. It almost looked like blood. Grimmjow laughed and said, \"Nice color! I like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to grab one vial when he found a small piece of paper folded within the box. He unfolded it and his eyes darted up and down along it. \"Let's see...experimental growth serum...causes extreme growth in subjects...results unpredictable...blah blah blah!\" Grimmjow crumpled it up into a ball and tossed it aside. \"Whatever! This is my one chance to totally decimate and destroy Kurosaki and I'm not giving it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe popped open the first vial and downed it in one gulp. He waited a few seconds to see if anything would happen...nothing did. He wasn't sure how long this was supposed to take before it started but he knew he wasn't a patient man that would wait to see. He popped open another one and downed it, then another, and another. Serum after serum disappeared into Grimmjow's toned stomach, the box slowly emptying, broken glass around his feet as he tossed the vials aside. Soon, there was not a single one left in the box. Grimmjow wiped his mouth and grinned, hands in his pockets, making his way to Ichigo's house. He had no idea what to expect, but he knew he was going to enjoy it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carefully hid himself in the shadows outside Ichigo's house, waiting, to make sure his opportunity was perfect. He didn't want any outside interference. Judging by the sun, Ichigo should be done with school and waiting innocently inside, maybe doing his homework, maybe just relaxing, not knowing that a world of torture was waiting for him! Grimmjow sneaked up to the house and peered inside a window. It didn't look like anyone was home. He grinned and knocked on the door. There was some muted sounds from within before the door was opened and Ichigo Kurosaki stood before the man who had personally stomped him into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what...?\" Ichigo stopped dead, his eyes widening as he saw who was at his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long time no see Ichigo Kurosaki!\" He instantly moved forward, grabbing Ichigo by the throat before lifting him into the air and throwing him back against the wall. He walked inside the house, closed the door, and locked it, barring the substitute Soul Reaper's only escape. \"I know I just kicked your ass hard enough to break ribs yesterday but I couldn't stay away! So, are you the only one in this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" Ichigo said, coughing slightly as he answered. His hand slowly pulled out his badge, aiming to release his soul and fight Grimmjow. Grimmjow stomped on the poor teenager's wrist a few times until he dropped the thing. He lightly picked it up and said, \"You won't be needing THIS anymore.\" He tucked it into his pocket and grinned at Ichigo. \"Now...let's have some fun, just the two of us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Grimmjow slowly got closer to Ichigo, sprawled in a heap on the ground against a wall, Ichigo noticed something that made his blood run cold.</span></div></div>",

Looking pretty small there, eh soul reaper?\" He said with a cocky smile. He looked down at Ichigo and saw him slowly sinking out of his sight. Ichigo could only watch as Grimmjow\u2019s pecs swelled up, pushing farther out from his body. Ichigo tried to move back, only to be stomped on his back by Grimmjow's lengthening, growing foot. Grimmjow's stomach filled, the hole that once proudly displayed itself vanishing behind abs that were popping up with unparalled strength, going from a six-pack, to an eight! Grimmjow\u2019s back flared out to match his pecs and his legs started to push further out at his pants. Grimmjow\u2019s thighs to his calves which were swelling with an alarming speed, matching the rest of his now enormous body.

Ichigo looked high up and couldn\u2019t even see Grimmjow\u2019s face from this incredibly low angle. Grimmjow\u2019s pecs were blocking it! Grimmjow's foot was coming down even harder now, without him even trying! The sheer size and mass was enough to keep the puny Ichigo pinned down to the ground. The thick beast could barely even fit in the entrance of the house anymore! All it would take was a mere move of his shoulders, and the room could come crumbling down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow managed to bend down over, and pluck Ichigo up by his shirt. \"You see that, Kurosaki?\" He said, \"Your puny human house can barely even handle my might!\" Grimmjow raised his arm, flexing a huge bicep, a long vein emerging along the peak. As Grimmjow grinned, admiring his own brawn, Ichigo pulled his fist back, and whacked Grimmjow across the face! Grimmjow's head twisted a little further, his neck making a sickly crack as it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Grimmjow's head moved back into place, cracking as it did. \"That it?\" He said, his voice deeper and darker than before. His arm stretched back, and threw Ichigo at the wall, making a huge dent in the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow started walking toward Ichigo once more, his footsteps ominous.

Pay attention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Ichigo looked as Tatsuki's fist was suddenly in his face, knocking him back against the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichigo, you have to pay attention!\" The teacher said from the sidelines. \"If you're not paying attention Tatsuki is always going to knock you down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo got to his feet and wiped his eyes a little before looking back at Tatsuki and holding his fists up again. Every since his mother had passed away a few weeks ago Ichigo had stopped crying, had stopped smiling, and had become a little more sullen and withdrawn. He seemed to be focusing more and more on his training, as though he was trying to get stronger for something...Tatsuki had noticed the more she fought him. He was actually getting better...but he still always got knocked down. It was like his heart wasn't in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, he wasn't. He had never been one for fighting as much as the other kids but ever since that day...he had a single minded need to get stronger now. It was to protect his family! He needed to be strong enough to protect them from anything or anyone! Karin...Yuzu...his fath--well, he could probably take care of himself now that he thought about it. He already knew he was a pretty strong boy, physically at least. After his mother passed away he had had....moments when he would tear around his room, punching and kicking things until he wore himself out. He had actually made a dent or two in the walls, despite the fact that his fists were so small. That was one of the reasons he didn't want to fight Tatsuki or the others. He knew he was strong. The other reason was because he was afraid of losing control. Whenever his emotions got too high or his anger overwhelmed him he seemed to be possessed and went around smashing and hitting things and people. Until he got his turmoil under control, he needed to be calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fifteen minutes went by and then class was over. Ichigo pulled on his coat and headed out the door. He had requested that he be allowed to walk home by himself after his mother died and his father had decided to allow it. It was one of the ways he was getting over her death. He sighed and stared at the ground as he walked. Little did he know that something very strange was about to happen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was about halfway home he heard a horrible beeping sound. He looked up and saw a truck speeding down the road, heading the opposite way he was moving. As it passed by, some kind of liquid was thrown over the small boy, covering him in a strange liquid. He yelled out and wiped his face, the liquid making his body feel numb for a second. He couldn't tell where from the truck the liquid had come, but it didn't improve his mood any. He felt his heart beat a little faster, anger evident on his face. For a second, it felt like his clothes were moving on his body...but Ichigo quickly gained control of his emotions and sighed. He turned and kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked...</span></div></div>",

His young, but strong toes felt as if they were being crammed into shoes that were a little too small for him. He ignored it, not thinking anything of it, and knocked at his door. He waited, and soon, his dad answered the door with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did ya have fun training, Ichigo? His dad asked, his fake smile not very convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchgio sighed. \"I guess... Tatsuki bet me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfffft! You'll beat her soon enough. You are a growing boy, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsshin rubbed Ichigo hair, slightly messing it up. Ichigo took off his jacket, and kicked off his tight shoes, luckily right there and then since if he would have kept them on, a little rip would've appeared at the front of them because of his slightly bigger feet and toes. He left his white, ankle high socks on, though he really couldn't feet a tightness in them yet. Ichigo's dad looked him over, noticing that his son's t-shirt was revealing about an inch or two of his slowly developing abs, his sleeves also straining slightly against Ichigo's biceps. His pants were also showing off his bare ankles now, his claves and thighs pushing out more than usual, his buldge poking out of his pants a little more. Isshin looked down at Ichigo's socked feet, and realized that it looked as if they were getting too small for his son's big feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe patted Ichigo's back. \"We're going to have to buy you some new clothes!\" He yelled, \"You really are growing so fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo smirked at his dad went into the kitchen, and he jumped onto the couch, lying down, his clothes feeling a tighter than before, very small rips appearing in a few places. He sighed and turned the TV on, flipping through the channels with his remote.</span></div></div>",

His face flashed into a mischievous grin as he realized he was getting even bigger! He was still undecided about what he would do if he kept growing but he just felt so good right now, he felt as if every cell in his body was just stretching and expanding with every inch he grew. The couch was now making groans of protest as his increase in weight just continued to add more and more pressure on it until it just couldn\u2019t take anymore and just broke underneath him and yet he just continued to grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the last frabics of clothing just falling away revealing his young, taut preteen body to the world as he stretched to almost two meters tall!  \u201cWow I just keep getting bigger and bigger!\u201d He said in a almost joy filled tone, he wanted to be big, bigger then any one he wanted to be stronger then any one. he never wanted to be hurt again to be beat again and with his body like this that would never happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026But he did not stop growing!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
