Not counting of course Scholar-General Kali-Nalla, Mystical-Advisor Shahn-Shatire, and Mobec Armen-jazheer. Okay,so you're the fourth most powerful mystical power the Sudeken,some say Sudekth, wield. That is still impressive mind you. You can cast illusions of entire armies, blind hundreds of men with a flick of your fingers, drive people and animals temporarily mad, and bind demons under oaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have it all, though today it seems that something is amiss. Whether it be the taste of your early morning coffee or the smell of your binding candles, some essential part of the universe has turned upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wear a distinctive green-bronze necklace depicting a rhino, the animal your mother named as your guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Third-Year Initiate Ava</b><br>\r\nIt is your first year at the college and yet for some reason everything has managed to blow up in your face!

And it was kinda your fault the Nasty Lads stole the entire kitchen staff's fingers. But you got them back right? Was it your fault that some girl accidentally drank <i>your</i> Gorgon's Breath potion. She got fixed eventually!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the only reason you haven't been kicked out of the college is both because of your mother's connections and your own considerable skill. Your a prodigy of summoning, considered Grand Magus' Shanadore's successor. So you have at least nepotism and pure skill going for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wear the distinctive green-bronze necklace of a oliphant, the elephant's dumber more destructive brother.

The ten or so other initiates stared as Ava came barreling in with all of her paperwork. Some even stepping back a little in fear of the papyrus the young lady carried. Professor Ali-Yajah peered down her beak-like nose in disapproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ava. You've cared to join us right on schedule.\" Professor Ali noted. Ava nodded and found her place in the semi-circle the students were formatted into.Ava dusted her initiate <i>skfah</i> as she listened in on the Professor's lecture;from beside her a voice whispered into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ava. Where were you?\" Kamala, her only friend in the college, questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was forced to go over my notes by an oath-spell I put upon myself. I forgot to calibrate my time, I was reading all the way up to one in the morning.\" Ava answered. Kamala grimaced at her friend's explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've asked Allahambra, he's a much better oath-spell caster than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he doesn't like me after the wind, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he got ove-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls?\" Professor Ali spoke \"Do you both have something to add?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Professor Ali-Yajah.\" Kamala and Ava said in unison. The professor nodded and went back to her lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To go over this once again, demons are prototypes of the god's hands. Hundreds of thousands of ideas that were cast aside as the world was slowly hammered into place. Now for why the god's didn't decide to execute these half-bred monstrosities, none can say.\" Professor Ali explained as she began to draw a circle of salt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor do we know why they respond to the calls of mortals. Well, no, we do know their reasons varies from demon to demon,but I meant to say why the god's have allowed this to go on unabated. Not to mention the horde of abominations that afflict the southern tip of our continent, but that is an explanation for another day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We, as in human society, have bargained with a select few demons over hundreds of year that we now have become somewhat familiar with their quirks and characteristics. We call these class of demons, devils. There are only one-hundred and thirty devils out of thousands of different demons. Only these demons are allowed to be summoned by practitioners,my students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Question, what if we summon a demon not on that list?\" A girl named Aljiarah questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you've screwed up and you should hope it's only stone-classed so you can easily strangle it where it stands. If not and you've actively summoned a demon, then you're a sorcerer and I shall personally cut your head from your shoulders.\" Professor Ali responded as she began to melt candle wax onto specific point in the salt circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now i'm going to be summon a silver-class devil for this demonstration. Higher than your stone, copper, and iron class that you initiates have hopefully read up on.\" Ali explained. She reached into her long cloak and pulled out a scroll. It was a black papyrus and blue letters glowed on its surface. Ali lit the parchment on fire and quickly planted it into the circle's middle, careful not to break it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe piece didn't collapse into a pile of ash but instead a shimmered like a mirage. A few moments later a figure materialized. It was over ten cubits in height, which caused the students to peer upwards. A tail of a snake slowly twisted up towards the body of a slimy, pale looking torso of a woman. Her stomach was reminiscent of an extremely pregnant goblin, but instead of soft flesh, it was a metal face with its eyes closed. Farther upwards,the devil's neck was long and as twisting as its tail. The neck terminated in one of the most gorgeous faces that Ava had ever seen. It was perfect, that was until Ava stared closer at it.She then switched thought of it as too perfect,it hit a valley of uncanny that made her shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a Sister Succubus. What task have you've chosen for me teacher of generations?\" The succubus asked. Professor Ali snapped her fingers and a assistant came rushing with an old looking rabbit. The poor thing's eyes were cloudy with age, it bucked  it's legs in silent pain.Professor Ali took the rabbit and gently guided it into the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish for a longer-life for this age wracked beast, sister.\" Ali gently spoke. \"I wish for a second chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus looked down at the grey rabbit and nodded. With a swift motion like a hawk on a squirrel, the rabbit was picked up and stuffed into the succubus' belly face's mouth. Three of the students gasped, Ava included. The face's eyes opened up and it began to shake. It soon coughed out a bundle of something and audible gasps came from several mouths. The slimy bundle ruffled itself for a bit,and to the student's amazement, it was the rabbit. Whole and de-aged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you ask of me,teacher?\" The succubus <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is all.\" Professor Ali spoke.\"Now listen closely students. <i>I relieve you of your duty,one who came before us.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus nodded and faded away, leaving behind the black papyrus. Professor Ali stretched for a bit and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe those things were supposed to be how new babies were born?\" She joked. \"But to explain what happened, that was, for all intents and purposes, a successful summoning. It should never take longer than that, they should never be conversed with for a long time, nor should you be rude to them. Now on to your own summoning, and if all of you follow your steps, these should be even shorter than this demonstration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students crowded around Professor Ali as she handed out piece of paper as well as partner students together.</span></div></div>",

It didn't move back up.The barbarian woman, five cubits in height, sent another ravaging hound across the snowy distance.The sound of cracked ribs could easily be heard as it landed in a heap. Ten wolves came to feast on a lone warrior, three had already fallen to her weapons. Her grandmother's staff was buried into the head of another beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come you bloodied curs, come mongrels of the snow tips, come man's enemies.\" Grune declared. She puffed her chest up to appear more intimidating. \"I wear on my shoulders a king of your kind. I killed him when him stalked into my tribe's longhouse, thought himself a ruler. I showed him, showed him he was't even worthy of my patriarch's time.But even then, he was a worthy creature. Tore meat from my body like the hunters of my tribe do to seals. I still killed him though, strangled him with my bare hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snarled at the wolves,who seemed to become fearful of the raving woman. She stalked forward and the wolves backed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet you lesser beasts think you could compare yourselves to him? Oh what ghastly little beasts you are,barely even a fart compared to the black wolf I wear now as my coverings.\" She spoke. \"So come, come closer and let me do to you what I did to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolves wisely ran off leaving their three dead to the barbarian woman. Grune laughed and set down her bone club to retrieve<br>\r\n the staff from the wolf's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weak.\" She mumbled. Grune looked around the white horizon, she did her best to find the tomb her patriarch spoke of. Rumors of a discarded tribe-tomb had recently been whispered among the clans. The tribe patriarch didn't speak much about it of course, rumors were not things to concern oneself with. It wasn't until a clan scout had spoken of seeing the rumored tomb that the patriarch decided it needed to be raided. It was decided Grune would be the first tribeswoman in to kill anything that might threaten their search party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barbarian jumped immediately onto the idea,and just as her patriarch had finished his declaration, had already rushed out to find the tomb. She had managed to get a copy of the scout's map, who already multiplied his notes, and set forth into the white wilds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had already been two days since she had went forth from her home. According to the map, she should've be around the area where the tomb was located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you my sweet flower?\" She whispered. Her eyes gazed like a hawk until she happily laughed in fruition. There! In the distance was the distinctive carved stone doors of a tomb. She laughed again and picked up her club. She then bound her staff onto her back, while she also placed a wolf carcass onto her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need some protein.\" She mumbled as she set forth. A hour later Grune was at the door, she gazed upwards. Two points high, one of the largest doors she'd ever seen. She shrugged and pushed, like all tomb doors, they surprisingly didn't offer much resistance to any force. She walked inside, quickly dropping her wolf carcass onto the ground, and readied her weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared but no monster came rushing at her. Grune was confused. She walked farther, now noticing the light that emanated from within. Rows of everlasting torches lined the walls of the room. Off to the other side she could see a door half-open. She looked down to the floor and noticed the corpses of long-dead Northernmen. Clutched between the ice-cold fingers of one of the men was an idol that caught Grune's eyes. She crouched closer to examine it.</span></div></div>",

She slowly unclasped the hands of the dead man and pulled the strange idol out from his hands. She felt warmth course through her hand as she examined the idol's curves and ridges. Grune laid her armaments down to the ground to slowly prod at the stature's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see no evil of the White Beyond.\" Grune spoke. She sat down and placed the idol near her side. The barbarian woman began to ponder what had transpired inside of the blaspheme tomb. What horrors could've ravaged these explorers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrune shook her head, whatever it may have been, she was chosen for a reason. Whatever she would fine, she'd kill it or drive it off, all for her tribe and clan. Unbeknownst to the barbarian, a subtle and invisible fiend had began pouring out of the maw of the idol. Slowly, like a creeping beast, it began to curdle and grope with airy hands. It drew itself ever so closer to Grune until it shot a misty hand straight through her body.

The heads of both Yasha, head of Strike Squadron Five, and Multiyada, head of Strike Squadron Seven, turned towards her.

Elven fire-marshals rushed towards the disturbance, as quickly as they could before the fire consumed the rest of their school. Upon arriving, the magicians did their best to quell and disrupt the elementals birthed in the ranging inferno. Moments later, a hurtling and screaming being rushed out of the fire. The marshals were just about to bind the fiery being, right before it burst in an explosion of water. There, panting in shock, was the bare form of Innara maah Tshaina.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh what the hell did I mix?\" Innara spoke. She looked around to see one of the fire-marshals rolling their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should've known.\" Another whispered right before he got back to containing the raging blaze. Innara huffed and quickly tapped her Domni ring. Specially crafted to act as a transporter for any Domni's personal items, Innara mainly used it to store her personal equipment. In just a flash, the white-haired elf was covered in her signature black cloak and purple scholastic robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Innara.\" The deep voice of head fire-marshal Nikhoro came from behind the alchemist. Innara turned to see the elven male with his distinctive glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikihoro.\" Innara responded. \"It appears that my latest endeavor has decided it wants to follow the path of its predecessors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it this time? Will we be dealing with mad homuncului again or what about incarnated imps?\" Nikihoro questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please,Nikihoro.\" Innara responded. \"Those only happened once and each several years apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet I can still see them in my sleep. So what was it you had cooking this time Domni Alchemist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. It was a study of transmutation that quite fascinated my mind.\" Innara began to explain. The pair moved farther away from the blazing door to allow more fire-marshals into the space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an Akantat mixture.\" Innara stopped as she looked at Nikihoro's face. The fire-marshal's eye was raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Yes. I know, that the dammed lizards are not to be trifled with, but these notes that I had managed to acquire were of the most excellent quality. They could've potentially revolutionize our plans against the <i>gakijin </i>and <i>dwarvana-oro.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess.\" Nikihoro interrupted. \"They were lost in the fire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not. I had them specifically coated by Mojimata. Those things could probably survive the eruption of this entire college if it came down to it. But I shan't elaborate on that subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't wanna think about the college erupting.\" Nikihoro chimed in. Innara waved him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, I was doing all the steps that were written on the paper, but it seemed that I accidentally translated 'I,G,C,' and 'D' for 'H,F,B' and 'C' in those papers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how'd you figure that out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it while I was burning. You know how my fire-proofing potion speeds up my thoughts. It helps bleed off that thermal energy and convert into my own.\" Innara happily explained. \"But yes, it seems that instead of whatever normal concoction I would've gotten if I had done it to perfect, instead I received a geyser of blue-gas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you require aid?\" Nikihoro questioned, concern on his face. Innara waved him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I believe i'm fine.\" Innara told him. \"Of course I was sputtering and cursing for a few moments, but in all honesty, I seemed to be quite well. That was until my concoction burst into flame, which caught fire on all the more flammable equipment, and now here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikihoro nodded as he digested her story. \"All right Innara, I heard enough. My elves and I will contain this mess, but you're lucky it wasn't Ishagojo this time around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes the boy is always doing his best to throw the book at me.\" Innara huffed. \"Now anyways, let me go explain to my colleagues what mishap I had concocted this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to walk off, Innara heard Nikihoro speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick question.

Innara placed a hand against her stomach and gasped in shock. He was right. She had somehow gained a small paunch where her normally flat elven physique was. Innara blushed, On a human this pudge wouldn't have been nothing, but on an elf? Ooh, it would've been the talk of the college if it got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere had she gotten this intake of fat from? She scratched her chin in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me for a moment.\" She spoke. Passing one of the fire-marshals, she stuck her head into the still raging inferno for a few moments. One of the younger fire-marshals gasped in shock and was about to rush into save the Domni, but was stopped by one of his older colleagues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Innara had brought her head back out, unlike before Innara seemed  more composed of her infernal wrappings. Nikihoro walked over and quickly snapped the fire away. Innara nodded to thank him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured out where this pudgy corpulence originated from.\" She happily said as she lead Nikkihoro away from prying eyes. The lead fire-marshal stared at the alchemist with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was supposed to be a potion of out-fusion has become one of infusion\" She joked with a small grin. \"It was supposed to turn one intangible, but it seems that my mistake has given me quite the figure. Large like a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to be okay?\" Nikkihoro questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite so.I just need my lab. After all this fire is put out, I shall easily search for a remedy for my affliction.\" She answered. Innara poked her stomach in joking assurance. Nikkihoro shook his head before he went back to help his men with the inferno.</span></div></div>",

If not for two qualities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne are their teeth which contain a poison. Non-deadly to anything larger than a cat, instead the effects are what worries people. Once injected into a living being system the poison will expand them to the point of immobility. While small animals will explode, larger being such as humans or elves would be all-right. Thankfully the effects are temporary, unfortunately it takes around seven to nine months to be reverted back to normal. And female Goblins are known to be quite bitey if they feel that their mates are endanger of being swoon away by another female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo is a three-month period that happens every five years. Called the \"Rambling\" by the Goblins and \"the Horror\" by the other species. In this period of time, Goblins of all the land come down with an urge to cause havoc.As added horror, the Goblins will do their best to spawn as many offspring as possible.The resulting boom of births,in turn, cause the Goblins to raid and feed their expanding families. Sometimes even expanding folks to use as hostages to leverage food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrcs:<br>\r\nPraetorian guards of the Akantati, Orcs were once the everlasting fear-mongers of the entire continent.Now with their masters ever so slowly becoming inert, Orcs have had time to contemplate their existence. Typically building communes around the base,and sometimes inside the lower levels, of the Black Towers of their Akantati overlords. Orcs are do not speak with their mouths, but instead through a system of mind communication.Which in turn is their greatest assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn orc versus any other species, both on equal footing, will lose. But once an orc joins with another of its kind, it changes. It becomes more refined, more dexterous, more deadly. The orc will complement the movements of its fellow as though both were one mind in two bodies. This deadly power multiplies with the more orcs that are in close proximity with each other.It is known that three-hundred orcs managed to fight against a thirty-five hundred opponents. All but nine-hundred and twenty were killed by these deadly warriors.</span></div></div>",

My clan had to wear loincloths to keep our relations in good order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun-Dune began to cut open one of the large,colorful fishes down the middle. The other she bit into, nonchalantly she placed the fish into a huge pot as it slowly began to swell. The fish bulged for a bit making creaking noises from its mouth. Sun-Dune quickly placed a cover over the pot and latched it tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even understand it either.\" Sun-Dune gesticulated. \"My body's covered in my goblin-gel, you can't even see my jiggly bits. Besides your chest is even larger than mine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTahsi huffed in offense. She covered her tiny bosom in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not that large.\" Tahsi exclaimed. \"You little frog.Even if I am large, it was because you cursed me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun-Dune grinned back at her, already finished preparing the fish for Tahsi to prepare her food. A little explosion echoed from the pot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gruel's almost done.\" She noted. \"and it was not me long-ear, not me. Its those ranckey artifacts we keep running across, and they like your magic more than they like mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have magic;only Akantat, elves, humans,demi-divine,harpies,and a select few chosen mortals have the touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me my luck isn't magic?\" Sun-Dune spoke with a tone of mock hurt. \"Unthoughthinkable. You're also telling me that my partnership with an elf isn't magic as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTahsi gaffed at that. \"We elves believe your kind to be one of few good things the Akantar have ever made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm honored.\" Sun-Dune spoke. She opened the pot to see the slushy remains of the fish still in it. She smiled as she sniffed the stew. Sun-Dune grabbed a bowl of water, some salt and pepper, and a pinch of crushed garlic, to swirl into the mix. Tahsi gagged and focused on her own dish. After twenty minutes, the two had prepared their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRefined suu-shin for Tahsi and whatever horrific gunk that was Sun-Dune's meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like my second sister used to make.\" Sun-Dune's eyes crossed for a moment. \"Or was it my third sister from my mom's second clutch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you're all set?\" Tahsi asked. \"Now can you please cover yourself up? Don't you worry of the weather afflicting you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not one bit, my partner. Lived in the stilt swamps all but two-years of my twelve year life.\" Sun-Dune declared. \"Ooh maybe this year I can experience my first on hand 'rambling'. I only got a good fifty-three years left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTahsi grunted in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best you enjoy your meal now because tomorrow we're heading into The Fleecer's Barrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun-Dune looked at her elven friend. \"You've been saying that for the past two-days now. What's so special about it anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides the fact its one of the last hundred or so unconquered treasure holds on this continent?\" Tahsi replied. \"It was home to The Fleecer, an Akantat thief, said to have stolen a god's weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf seemed more excited than the goblin, who only raised an brow at the mention of her master-god and the treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds splickty.\" Sun-Dune replied. \"I'll sleep good on that thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun-Dune pushed her pot away and began to clean her mess up. She wondered what tomorrow would bring her and her partner in hunting.</span></div></div>",

She slowly poured the powder into a pot that was off to the side of Rock-Bone's tent-home. The elf then took out a container, opening the top to pour in clear water into the pot.

She wiped her head and tugged at her armor piece, why was it so hot all of a sudden? She licked her slimy face with her tongue in worry. Many people were crying out besides their wrecked homes, while others did their best to put out the fires. A man quite familiar to Human-Kiss walked up to her, his hand gripped his shotel with quiet intensity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss.\" Ashbel spoke, making it obvious he was dropping the 'human' part of her name. Human-Kiss grimaced at the response, she and Ashbel were usually on much more cordial terms. Not today it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do so apologize.\" Human-Kiss spoke. \"It was an oversigh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AN OVERSIGHT!\" Ashbel screeched before his voice calmed down. He rubbed his eyes a little, sweat dripped down the sides.\"I remember my mother's stories about how your kind came in these numbers twenty-five years ago.Twenty-five years ago, your clan was supposed to have fixed the mistakes of the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuman-Kiss knew what he was talking about. This was an almost mirror of the Tribunal-Ramblings, the one that formed the tribunal in the first place. They were supposed to have planned against such a thing ever occurring again. How'd this become so destructive was an investigation Human-Kiss was not looking forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Townsman Ashbel, I know. It was a mistake and fourteen goblins who were associated with this have already been apprehended.\" Human-Kiss spoke. Her time with the humans had made her adopt a more \"sophisticated\" way of speaking compared to her kin,though she could still posses that distinct goblin dialect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow my children to assist you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshbel sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think the town is quite ready to see any more goblins at this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then allow us to help, let us keep our previous relations still strong.\" Human-Kiss pleaded. \"I've heard about the one poor miss that was bitten more than usal, please let me see to her at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshbel gave another sigh, but he straighten himself. \"Let's go see Dinah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked past Kiss and made sure to cover her from angry eyes. About one-third of the young folks of the town were spherical, or puffy, looking versions of themselves.Some yelled as Human-Kiss walked by, while others cried at the sight of her. Human-Kiss lowered her head in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can you tell me about Dinah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's our town arms-master, she takes care of our militia's stockade. In fact, the reason why she was bitten so many times was because she was trying to protect as many people as she could.\" Ashbel explained. \"Also, don't bring up her size at the moment,its not something she wants to dwell on,seeing as she's going to be like that for seven to nine months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Or more</i>.\" Human-Kiss thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two eventually came to the afflicted woman and Human-Kiss gasped in shock. Two children, one a baby the other a toddler, were right besides a large sphere of light-brown. She was larger than some of the mud-houses the town was made up of. Her breasts were huge,nearly the size of two goblins in a fetal position.Each tipped by dark brown nipples.Her womanhood was only protected by a sheet of linen and the fact she was placed onto her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinah?\" Ashbel spoke. \"Its me.

They both sat down and began to speak once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to start anything with those elves.\" Ashbel said. \"Its not that I don't have love for them, which I don't, but the town can't handle a strikeforce. They'll tear us apart if they'd come. I also need to make sure the town doesn't scream loud enough for the army to come marching onto your settlement. We'd both don't want that, do we? So what advice can you offer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can always offer three of my strongest children. They'll do it splickety.

Made mostly as messengers and Akantati hunter-chefs, these days the Salamandaria live a life of quiet solitude. They trade exclusively with Orcs, while sharing good relations with dwarves. Elves kill them on sight,though that could be when elves meet most Akantat species. Humans generally distrust them, though some communities have been known to work closely with these nomads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost Salamandaria, barring their eldest,appear human-like in their stature. However, they covert their horns over their figures, ignoring their supple forms. Many merchants looking for profit have been known to wear stylized helmet-horns as a way to appear more <i>attractive</i> for the Salmandaria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gnomes</b><br>\r\nSurprisingly not another \"up-lifted\" race, Gnomes came into the world relatively later compared to the other species on the continent. About three-thousand or so years, give or take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGnomes live in one city-state, many would consider such an idea unwise, if plague or war came where would they go? That is if not for the fact Gnomeoploi is known as one of the Ten Wonders of The World. It spans over thirty points high and over half a league in depth.Sky ferries land around their sprawling towers and even dwarven engineers look upon in envy. Their plumbing is fantastical, medical facilities are superb, and their weaponry fierce. Only their strict neutrality and erudite ways are they kept protected from the same fear and disgust that they Akantati possess. With barely any interference by Akantati hands,the gnomes are considered a 'pure' race by elves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGnomes are obsessed with hats,with the material and coloration being their set of standards. Silk,red, and tipped are considered the highest of their kind; blue,cotton,and floppy are considered the lowest of the common folk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGnomes are taller than dwarves, but are smaller than humans are average. Only their scruffy tails and almost hand-like feet are they distinguished from a smaller human.</span></div></div>",

I forbid him to go see the pleasure tents or the 'ascension' houses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgor stretched his body a little, his old bones creaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're a good lass and I wish for you to watch him, the same couldn't be said for the rest of his friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope smiled. \"Fine, I'll keep Wallace's hanse in line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgor offered her his hand, which she gladly took. The two shook and Penelope walked off towards the place Igor said Wallace would be. Soon arriving at the outskirts of the village, Penelope saw Wallace speaking to his group. Jeremiah, Lon-Zah, Shallah, and Turk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penelope! Hello!\" Lon-Zah spoke. The boy's elven heritage could be seen clearly on his tall frame. Penelope waved politely as she approached. Wallace, a red-haired youth, gladly waved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got my message? Are you ready to depart? Wait, are you coming in the first place?\" The lad spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll come Wallace, its nice to see you as well.\" Penelope replied. The other three friends started to speak with the newcomer as they traveled down the beaten roads. It was about a fifteen minute walk to the mount, the group prattled about what they'd do once they got to the fabled place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they came across a fork in the road.One path in the road traveled westward while the eastern path lead towards two women in the distance. The group walked east until they saw the women. Both were obviously nude with the only decency that covered them were their long orange hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt!\" One spoke. \"Relinquish all weapons if thou desires to head forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hanse showed no weapons on their persons and were quickly let go without much hassle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk looked back at the two, and with confidence he wouldn't be heard, spoke of his observations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two nymphs were dammed beautiful!\" He whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those weren't nymphs;half-nymphs.\"Shallah responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you that?\" Turk shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trues nymphs make those two look like rags.\" She answered. \"And I also saw that ever so distinctive half-nymph trait. Get them a smidge excited and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShallah placed her hands on her chest and brought them forward, a 'boing' sound escaped her lips.She then did the same for her buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The silent nymph was doing her best to stay quiet for her friend, she was using her hair as a cover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Turk said slackjawed with the distinct show of sleaze on his face. Shallah nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read up on them if you want to learn more you little sex-goblin. On second thought, no, you'd probably never leave the house if you'd learn about their quirks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk was about to say something more, if he wasn't stopped by the sight of Mount Festivity's  merry party. The mountain loomed in the background of hundreds of different caravans, palace-tents, yurks, wigwams, and what have you. A swirling cloud covered the tip of the mount, with the occasional blast of lighting illuminating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" Wallace happily declared.</span></div></div>",

An informal mix of a picnic and an impromptu orgy. The chance to relax, tense muscles and ease unfamiliar pressures meant scattered couples disappeared into the nearby greenery. The scattering sound of giggles, and groans, were mixed with some more energetic noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two captains toasted their good fortune, and the good humour of the assembled men... and women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food was spiced with a variety of local herbs, both known and unknown.

As a captain, he was more used to having his one (albeit tiny) cabin, and a bed build into the walls of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, that would seem like the greatest luxury. Rowing back, he hoped the exercise would tire him out, and make sleep come easier. Securing the rowing boat in place, he stepped onto the Sturdy Sqwuak. Immediately, he felt at home. The gentle rocking familiar to his feet, he nodded to the bridge and the crewman keeping a watch there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising a hand, he covered his mouth as a yawn escaped.

Wrestled to the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting, and struggling to explain, Captain Hawking found her new body was weak and vulnerable. The assault more intended to humiliate and embarrass her, than contain a dangerous enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rump and tits slapped relentlessly, she had to defend them with her arms tight against her chest to prevent the tweaking, smacking, tickling attack. This damned body was too sensitive, she cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms were easily held tight against her heightening her vulnerability. She wriggled and struggled, but it was futile. Pinned to her side, her slender arms were useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriven against the deck railing, the air was driven from her lungs. Captain Hawkings watched as his dinner spewed forth into the sea, as she fought to regain her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn breathless outrage, she felt her crew playing the bongos, on her exposed ass cheeks. Roaring laughter, as she shrieked her outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least that was less degrading than the teasing caresses that followed. As her cheeks burned red and raw from the onslaught, she was held in place. The caressing hands that came next made her squirm, and grind against the railing. A fire ignited, she was mewling and whimpering with need, as she bawled, and yelped, yipping out her name in a mantra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain... Teach... Hawking...\" she repeated it, again and again. The relentless attention making it high and shrill one moment, and rapid and licentious the next. It was only the misunderstanding that she was the captain's doxy that made it end. A murmur of suspicion passing through them, until no-one wanted to tease the captain's favourite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Hawking whirled around, face flushed, breathing rapid, she looked as she felt.
