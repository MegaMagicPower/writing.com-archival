            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karina Quinn was driving to her doctor's appointment when the incident occurred. Her car wasn't moving too fast at the time, and it was pretty sturdy so it didn't take a whole lot of damage, but any time a vehicle is rear-ended by a van there's going to be a major headache. After taking a moment to compose herself and catch her breath, which the crash had taken out of her in one big gasp, Karina pushed her door open and went to confront the van driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a heated argument. Karina used her 5' 10 height and larger frame to try and intimidate the unidentified male driver, but the man was not backing down. Karina tried to insist on taking his details for insurance purposes, but all she got in return were insults about her size, which she ignored as usual. She was furious, and justifiably so, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when the man got out to inspect the minor damage on the front of his vehicle that Karina spied a revenge plan. As it happened,it was a delivery van that had hit her, one that was emblazoned on its side with the logo for a bakery company called Arabian Delights. The flowery logo had next to it a woman of Arabian appearance, a belly dancer, swaying her hips and lightly covered with pink and red silks. Karina had a second of pause as she considered how similar in appearance the belly dancer was to herself, the dark hair and large eyes, the large breasts and wide hips. The difference was that Karina had moved passed the dancer's physique two or three years ago, and had only kept gaining weight since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for this was why Karina was heading to the doctor that morning. She had a medical condition, one that started developing when she hit puberty, that gave her increased appetite. Not just a slight hunger, but a real burning need for food even when full. Doctors said that her brain acted almost like that of an addict giving up the thing they craved. Karina could never really satisfy her hunger, but she could keep it in check with several small meals a day, and light snacking. She put on weight, which the doctors said was inevitable, but it was nowhere near the levels the doctors had at first predicted. Karina had been proud of that. The thing that really stung her about the fat jokes was that people were looking at her like she had no self-control, when in fact, she probably had more than any of them. They didn't understand that for them, self-control was eating one piece of chocolate when they wanted two, but for Karina, it was eating ten pieces when she wanted fifty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunger was most difficult to keep in check when she was stressed or angry, as she was right now, with a damaged car and on her way to get her prescription of appetite suppressors. It was for this reason that Karina did something she would not normally do. The back door of the Arabian Delights van was open, and its contents were clear to her. Boxes piled on top of each other, labelled on the side with large colourful cartoony descriptions, lemon cake, double chocolate brownies, assorted donuts. That sort of thing. The driver was still looking at the scratches, distracted, and Karina had a rush of blood that often comes around when her appetite is particularly insistent. She opened the boot of her car and, with swift motions, started loading boxes into it from the back of the van. Once it was nearly full she slammed her boot, and drove off quickly as the absent-minded van driver continued his inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after her appointment with the doctor, who proudly said to her that she had maintained her weight over the last month, which was almost unheard of for people with her condition, that Karina noticed something very unusual. She felt no guilt. She had no shame in her actions. She walked through it logically in her head, she had had her car damaged by a reckless driver, who had not been willing to compensate her. So she took something that belonged to him, something she needed and enjoyed. Karina was not a harsh or cruel person, but she was firm and believed in a sense of justice in the universe. You get out what you put in, right? After a month where she had managed to not put on a single pound, she wanted to be rewarded for her efforts. That's what some people didn't understand, she thought to herself. You shouldn't be remorseful for taking something in exchange for the hard work you put into life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, she unpacked her car and began to lay out all the boxes she'd taken onto the kitchen counter of her apartment. There wasn't a whole lot of room, it was a small apartment and she'd only recently moved out of her parents' place, but she stacked the fifteen boxes on top of each other with the bright stickers pointing towards her, and admired her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving eaten the lamb chops she made herself for dinner, Karina sat by the TV, eyed the kitchen door, and thought about her prize of the day. After the good work of the last month she had to decide, should she just have a little taster, or have a full, satisfying blow-out on the dozens of treats she had bought?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina took a box from the top of the stack and opened it, it was a whole lemon meringue pie. She cut off a generous slice off and placed the tip of the slice against her lips. The sensation was instant, creamy and sharp and rich and thick, like all her favourite meals at the same time. She took a bite, then another, then a bigger bite. Her belly growled back in pleasure. Karina felt a rising warmth of bliss as she filled her mouth with the creamy slice and then, it was gone. And Karina found herself standing over the rest of the pie, with a fire in her stomach, and a knife in a hand. The self-control that she prided herself on all her life was about to withstand its first test.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karina slept soundly that night. It was a point of pride to her that she could maintain control when she was presented with chances to give in to her body's yearning. It's what separated her from... well, not other fat people, because Karina didn't dislike obesity. It's what separated her from other people's perception of her. It was having other people view her one way, and being able to prove to them how wrong they were, that's where the pride manifested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Karina was settled and pleased that she stopped at one slice after that dinner. She didn't even give it a second thought the next day, until she returned home from work. The trouble with temptation is that resisting it once isn't enough. Resisting it over and over again is fine, but the objection of temptation remains. Each night Karina would return home from work, or from out seeing her friends, or from a little light shopping, and find her kitchen heaving with delicious baked goods. The smells, they were what hit her when she first entered her apartment. For a few days she reluctantly kept herself to just a single slice of cake, or a single donut, every day. Eating a little extra for each meal gave her the incentive to say she didn't need that second piece, one was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as is always the way, once that one bad day rolls around, all the best plans can fall apart. Work was a nightmare, her friend cancelled on a drinks night that she'd been looking forward to, she received an unexpected bill... little things that didn't matter too much in isolation. When they all come together on the same day though, any person can crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina had survived her horror day mostly intact but when she got into bed she just didn't want to sleep. She was mad at how people in her life had treated her, she knew in her heart she was better than that. She turned on her side and pouted and thought about how to make the best of a new day tomorrow. Her thoughts turned to food as her stomach roared at her, and Karina detected the smell of the cakes wafting from her fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped out of bed, trying to be silent and discrete, as if that made a difference. As a teenager she was a huge midnight snacker, before she learned to have better control. She had brief reminiscences of those years of her life, when the weight gain was rapid and the doctors and her parents' concerns were most obvious. She remembered being doted on a lot as she fought with the hormonal problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunger that had defined her roared and snapped inside her. Karina removed a box from the fridge, huge apple danishes, iced thickly and coated in cream. Just staring at the treat in the pale moonlight gave Karina cause to think about all the things she usually denied herself. Her full appetite was monstrous, she had always known, but it had been so long since she had been even close to reaching those levels. She imagined huge tables groaning with the weight of food, and her at the head, pouring great bowls and plates directly into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the visions intensified in her mind Karina's hands got to work. She grabbed at the danishes and pushed them into her deeply groaning mouth. The tastes were intoxicating. Her gluttony unbound she finished off the box in the space of minutes and set upon the next. Images in her brain played on loop of her as the belly dancer on the Arabian Delights van, swaying her wide hips before a baying audience, men and women alike staring lustily at her as she moved her huge gut before them, shouting out compliments and offers, promising her a hedonistic life of luxury. For a brief moment Karina was that belly dancer, symbol of Arabian Delights, literally filling herself up with their products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, in the middle of the reverie, Karina was snapped awake. The box was empty. It had contained easily 20 of the pastries, and should have lasted her weeks. Instead it had disappeared in a few weak minutes. Karina quickly stood up and stared at the empty box, before throwing it out of sight, trying to trick herself into believing the events had not happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned to bed, a little stunned by her exploits. The treats had unlocked something in her mind, something she fervently wished she could shut out. Lingering images remained, overlaying her own face and body with that of the belly dancer she had seen, and Karina worried about exactly what unbidden desires would be in her mind come the morning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The problem with breaking a habit once is that it becomes far easier to break it repeatedly, as Karina quickly found out. The fact of the matter was that each time Karina went to bed, she was reminded of the first experience she'd had with the Arabian Delights bakery. She now associated sleep with food. It was bad enough during the day with her usual appetite problems but it was twice as bad at night, laying in bed in her underwear and having nothing to distract her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two nights were the same as that first one. Karina would lay in bed for a while, trying to wrap herself in the sheets and block out the cry for cake that echoed inside her poor unfilled belly. But she would only be able to resist for a limited amount of time, and eventually would have to move her bulk down to the kitchen and stuff herself with treats straight out the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third night Karina knew that something had to change. She always kept baggier clothes around the house because she knew her weight gain problems couldn't always be put off. She hated having to resort to them though, and when she had to go a size up on her work shirts she knew she couldn't keep up her midnight gorging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she decided to channel her distracted mind more constructively</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Karina's appetite for food took over her life sometimes, and in many ways it pushed aside other appetites that people would commonly have. She hadn't been in a relationship for a few months, and she had a strange connection to sex. She enjoyed it, no doubt about that, but she didn't really think about it much when she wasn't getting any. Some people wouldn't be able to go a few days without an orgasm, but Karina never felt that way. She liked sex but never seemed to miss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't stop her from owning a couple of interesting toys. A previous friend of hers who had introduced Karina to the concept of a \"fuck buddy\" had insisted on buying her a vibrator and using it regularly, and Karina had used it on her own from time to time but it had also felt superfluous, like masturbation was just a crude way to kill time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was, that was exactly what Karina was looking for. Having eaten to much on the previous night and knowing her fortitude was low, Karina left her vibrator on her bedside desk and tried sleeping naked. When she found she couldn't sleep and, instead, was filled with a restless hunger, she managed to make the conscious choice not to go down to the kitchen as before and snack on food, but instead, channel that energy and desire into masturbating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina enjoyed the feel of her skin against her hands and found that her extra-soft belly and increased breast size made for a more intense experience than usual. She delicately stroked her nipples and pushed the vibrator deeper and faster inside her, biting her lip and feeling sweat build as she rolled her hips. It was doing the trick, she wasn't thinking about food almost at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Karina came it was an intense and unexpected jolt, a livewire running up her spine. She moaned sleepily and slowly stroked herself until she came to a second dozy climax, falling asleep soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that night the dreams came to her...</span></div></div>",
