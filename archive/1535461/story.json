            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ugh!  I really didn't want to go to school today.  Well, that was every day actually, but today was different.  See, my name's Evan and I'm definitely on the dorkier side of the social spectrum; naturally, this means I'm a prime target for all the teasing, bullying, and hazing of those who are on higher social ground.  Oh sure, it's not ALWAYS like that... I mean, I'm not some friendless loser like the Anime Club guys or something.  Hell, there's at least a couple of \"cooler\" people that I talk to.  But that's kind of the exception, really, NOT the rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut yeah, I'm sort of going off point here.  Anyway, back to why I didn't want to go to school.  It was just a feeling in the pit of my stomach.  A feeling that something bad was about to happen: maybe somebody would call in a REAL bomb threat, or maybe I'd get extra hazing from that jerk Tony Coletta, maybe I'd just fall into a pit... I don't know.  All I know is that I definitely didn't want to go to school today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh suck it up you baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swear, Corinne could be a real pain some times.  We got along well most of the time but man, at times she could be extremely irritating.  I think she had a bit of an ego or something: \"oh Evan, how come you've never had a girlfriend?  I mean, I'm a freshman and some of the seniors definitely scope me out!\"  I mean yeah, she was a nice-looking girl but c'mon.  It's teenage guys, you have breasts; you're not special!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister's right.\" I glanced up at my mom, not really surprised she took Corinne's side.  I'd have to have leprosy before she'd even THINK of keeping me home from school.  \"You're not sick or anything and you can't stay home because you're feeling mopey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGee, thanks mom.  Although I can't really blame her.  My dad walked out on us about 9 or 10 years back so my mom raised my sister and me by herself.  I know she doesn't want us to end up as deadbeats like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I trudged through another boring day of school: made small talk with my buddy Ryan, ogled some of the hotter girls like Stacey Everett, sat through a few boring classes... typical school stuff.  And then third period came and that's when IT happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody still has a real reason why it happened.  I've heard some of the conspiracy nuts on a couple of the message boards I go to say that it was some kind of military experiment that got out of control.  Maybe it was, I don't know.  I don't even think it matters, really.  I mean... like 90-something percent of the world just up and switched bodies, it screwed people up.  There were deaths due to accidents of all sorts (although people inflate all that).  It wasn't Armageddon or anything, but it WAS a time of great confusion and panic.  Even now, things aren't really NORMAL, but everyone's adjusted.  I guess it was a little easier than you think, since people tended to mostly switch along age lines and in the same general location.  That wasn't always the case though, as I heard a kid in my science class got switched into some old guy who was in the middle of a heart attack; likewise, the football coach got switched into the body of a 13-year-old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also the aftershocks: more waves with the same result as the first that came every couple of days for about a week or so.  They tended to swap less and less people, though.  The first one swapping about 50% and the fourth and final one only being like 1%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, my point was that I don't think the cause matters.  It happened, what's done is done.  Like I said, like 90% or so of the people in the world switched bodies initially.  I, of course, wasn't an exception.  One minute, I'm listening to Mr. Tomlin give some boring lecture on right angles, the next... well.  I definitely wasn't myself, that's for sure...</span></div></div>",

I looked around, the other students had a confused look on their face to. Suddenly Joshua, THE GEEK of the school, graps Lucy, Corinnes best friend, and starts shaking her yelling: \"Give me back my body, why did you steal it, give it back!!!\" Ms. Fisher clapped her hands: \"That's a great performance Joshua\" Joshua looked at the teacher with an angry face: \"I'm not Joshua, I'm Lucy\" That's when it hit you, if all those people in this room are looking so weird, checking out their body, and being confused WHO WOULD YOU BE?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down and saw 2 things that weren't there before ... 2 ... it's kind of still weird to talk about, adleast a litle, but well ... I saw breasts, and they were attached to me and I was wearing the girls uniform. Slowely the idea of who I had become came into my mind, but I needed to know for sure. I quickly looked for my purse to find some identification, but as I found my purse, it was identification enough ... I had become my own sister Corinne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Fisher\" I asked worriedly \"I'm ... I'm ... I'm not Corinne, I'm her brother\" Ms. Fisher smiled warmly: \"That's a good performance to, waw I never expected our class of \"what if I swapped bodies with someone\" would be this succesfull\" Suddenly the whole class yelled: \"BUT WE REALLY DID SWAP\" Ms. Fisher raised her eyebrauws: \"You all do seem very realistic about this.\" Suddenly some guy jumped up from his chair: \"Ms. Fisher it's me, Mr. Parkson, it's true what they say, I swapped to and now I'm in the body of one of your students.\" The guy claiming to be Mr. Parkson sounded very mature and persuasive. \"You really did swap?\" Ms. Fisher asked worriedly, all of classes nodded \"I don't know what happened, but class is dismissed, we need to find out what happened, just be safe ok? Don't do anything to make it worse.\" Ms. Fisher said as she opened the door and let everyone out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoshua was still shaking Lucy and had her pinned on the ground in class, as I ran out of the room together with all the other students, I saw some girls running to the toilets, people talking to each other, some happy some scared, and even others were pretending nothing ever happened. The whoel school was Chaos<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat shoudl I do now?</span></div></div>",

People nudged, elbowed, stepped on, and nearly tackled me in their rush to either leave the building or find their old body, to the point the physical pain from the commotion distracted me from being my sister. I knew I was Corrine, and it still felt weird to be shorter, thinner, and weirdly-proportioned, but on top of my distracted mind, Corrine had a sleek, athlete's physique from tennis and varsity volleyball, with distinct breasts but no spine-snapping D-cups like Olivia or Tara. As far as female bodies I could have possessed went, Corrine's was on the manageable side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd carried me all the way to the mathematics hall, where I'd been when this... giant swap thing happened. <i>If I'm Corrine,</i> I thought, <i>Corrine's probably me!</i> This wasn't necessarily true, of course, but it was something to work off of. I wormed my way between the students patting themselves down or reaching for their new body's cell phone, hoping each step not to trip in Corrine's tight, dainty slippers. Ms. Tomlin's class approached slowly. Finally I burst through the doorway and came upon a nearly-empty room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrine?\" I said, looking in. There were a few students rummaging through backpacks and purses along with a Mexican janitor who stood in the back corner, away from everybody else, hoping to disappear into the shadows. My body was nowhere among the mix, and none present responded to \"Corrine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What if she's gone?</i> I thought. <i>She went looking for me? Or she's going home to check on Mom and Dad? I should probably check too...</i> I wondered if the world outside was any safer than here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't have to worry too long, since a voice behind me yelled, \"Hey! I'm Corrine and you're in my body!\" A hand came down on my shoulder and whirled me around, so I came face to face with...</span></div></div>",

I faintly remembered Corrine's boast about seniors scoping her out that morning but didn't care; she was truly humiliated, and I had to be there for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, sis,\" I said, putting an arm around her. \"No matter what body you're in, we're family.

Tony could choose to believe what he wanted; so long as we had him, there was guaranteed protection from anybody who tried to harm us.

It couldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the math hallway connected with a side entrance less than twenty feet away from us, so with Ryan in front, yelling \"Make way! Move it, asshole!\" we broke into fresh air within five minutes. Outside, the crowd was spread out, just as big but covering a much bigger space. I strained my eyes against the sun and looked across the main street next to our school. Cars were strewn carelessly around the street with their alarms blaring. Immediately I knew the swaps were happening outside our school to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get going,\" Corrine urged, walking briskly in the direction of our house. I ran to catch up, and Tony strolled behind us, taking his time like the world wasn't falling apart around him. Even though she had massive pumps and - based on the way her butt wriggled, and she winced every few seconds with each wayward step - a thong riding up her crack, Corrine did pretty well walking with Tara's body. At times she almost looked... comfortable? I pushed that thought away too, along with the hunch that Corrine's body felt pretty snug too. The breasts weren't too big, her hair stroked my face gently in the wind, and she was more fit than I ever dreamed of being. But I was still a boy, I reminded myself, and that's the life I wanted to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were a few minutes away from our house when a dirty-brown box on wheels - our old family van - zoomed by, stopped, then reversed next to us. The window slid down, and someone inside, invisible beneath the refracted sunlight, said, \"That's Corrine, right?\"</span></div></div>",

She nearly tackled me to the ground with her hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrine! I was so worried! I looked out the window and the whole neighborhood was going crazy, I thought, <i>I hope you're safe at school,</i> but the news said this was a national crisis, so I had to check on you straight away, now you're here and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Mom! Mom!\" I yelled her name until she let go and took a deep breath. With all these swapped bodies, confused identities, and magical happenstance, I was surprised to find myself assuming, quite naturally, that this woman, who had my mom's body, talked with my mom's voice, and drove my mom's car was, in fact, my Mom. You couldn't be too sure with anyone, I'd repeated to myself; except nobody showered Corrine with so much worry except for my mom and grandma, and grandma'd been dead for three years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, dear?\" Mom said, wiping her tears. \"Where's your brother? I see Ryan, and... I don't know this girl, where's...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, listen to me.\" I put my hands on her shoulder, to steady her for the inevitable shock. \"I'm not Corrine. I'm Evan. I'm in Corrine's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gave me the dirtiest look, inquisitive but offended; it's the \"You got to be shitting me\" look practiced by every parent worth their salt. I recognized it and responded: \"I know you think that's bullshit but you saw the news, you've heard people asking where there body is. I went to school as Evan and then, next thing I knew, I'm my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to believe him, Mom.\" Corrine stepped forward, brushing Tara's velvet-night hair back. \"I'm the real Corrine. And Ryan isn't Ryan but a football player from school, Tony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'up?\" Tony said with a wave; then he lapsed into silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long, uncomfortably stifling minute - the sun seemed hotter; wind harsher - Mom said nothing. She nodded, shook her head, crossed her arms and uncrossed them until I thought we might as well walk on because Mom wasn't going to make up her mind. Then she said, quietly, \"I can hear my children no matter what voice they have. I believe you... This is impossible, but... I believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine, Mom and I joined in a tentative group hug that broke quickly. I understood Mom's discomfort, especially with her son turned into a girl and her daughter made even more of a girl, so I let her deal with the situation in her own way. Mom shepherded us into the car before turning back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best thing now is to get away from this mess,\" Mom said, and none of us disagreed.</span></div></div>",

I didn't know my squat, dusty designer home would ever make me wistful, but right then I wanted to fall down where I stood and sleep on the wooden living room floor. The only thing that kept me standing was Tony ogling Corrine - or Ryan ogling Tara, however you saw it. I wanted to be there to sock Tony's jaw if he made one filthy move. He could kick my ass to the moon and back, but I hoped, being a girl, he'd make exceptions for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's check out the news,\" I said, \"Find out what's happening to everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'mmmmm going to go take a shower,\" Tony said with a dramatic yawn. \"Then I'll just swipe some of your clothes, Evan, if that's cool. You probably don't mind, since you... won't be needing them anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" I added sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony chuckled. \"Whatev. I'll join you guys after. You want me to bring something, baby? I can check your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if you'd just stay out of my room, that'd be nice,\" Corrine snarled. Even her upper lip curled up with the grimace, an expression I'd only seen Tara make - never my sis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, jelly bean. Let me know if you change your mind!\" Tony slapped Corrine's ass on the way up the stairs--in my shock, I almost didn't notice he never asked where the shower was, like he'd used it before--and she lit up like police sirens, blue and red with a flash of pale in between. I wanted to drag him down right there and then but he was already hurtling up the stairs, nearly to the top. I turned to Corrine and put an arm on her shoulder, curling Tara's hair between my fingers (<i>A little feminine much, Evan?</i> I asked myself, and answered, <i>I'm just consoling her.</i>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let him get to you,\" I cooed, and tapped her shoulder. \"You're not Tara, and soon as we can, we'll kick him out. We got Mom on her side... Why are you crying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed Corrine's tears, fresh, warm, and embarrassed. She tried to look away but I forced her to lock eyes with me. \"What's wrong?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand,\" she sputtered. \"It felt good. When he slapped me I wanted... to grab him back... grab him back...\" She gestured at the crotch area. \"I'm so.... so... God, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? You can tell me.\" But I knew and dreaded her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so <i>horny,</i> Evan!\" She didn't have to add it, but after a pause, she said, quieter, \"Just like Tara.\"</span></div></div>",

Having no experience with Tara's accessories, Corrine didn't react immediately; she waited a few seconds until it became clear this was Tara's phone ringing. She rummaged inside the purse until she pulled out a trendy, sticker-decorated smartphone and checked the caller ID. I tried to look over her shoulder but she'd already answered the phone and put it to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Corrine nodded. \"This is... I'm Corrine. From school... Tara?\" She lowered the phone and whispered, \"It's Tara. She's a boy now.\" Then Corrine trounced up stairs to take the rest of the call in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI trudged off to the kitchen, disconsolate with the knowledge my sister was growing a libido in her body, like a parasite, that demon fly-baby Jeff Goldblum gave Geena Davis in <i>The Fly</i>... Or rather, that libido had been there all along, and Corrine was just discovering it. I shivered; if possessing someone's body meant you assumed parts of their personality, would I start acting like Corrine? I didn't feel different...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's some strawberries.\" I was startled from my revery by Mom gesturing at me with a plate of cut, sugar-coated strawberries, a family favorite. She set it on the table with four cups of tea. \"Where's your, uh, sis, and the boy who's Ryan now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's... I dunno.\" I shrugged; I knew he was showering but didn't feel like saying it, for some reason. \"And Corrine's taking a call. It's from the girl who owned her old body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind me asking...\" Mom sipped her tea. \"That body Corrine's got... She's not a, uh... Reputable lady around school, is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help chuckling. \"Far from it, Mom. Her name's Tara Johnson, and the reputation she's got wouldn't pass mustard in a church.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"Corrine always wanted to be popular with the boys. Now she finds out what that's like and I hope that teaches her: be careful what you wish for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if that's the lesson she needs,\" I said, thinking back to Corrine's words: \"I'm so <i>horny!</i>\" Nobody needs to experience that, even a bratty little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they'll figure out how to switch her back,\" Mom said, for her sake as much as ours, \"And you too. In the meantime, you get to learn a little about being sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy! What an experience.\" I laughed, but thinking about Corrine just put me in a bad mood, so I went to have a few of the strawberries and drink my tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine walked into the room a minute later. Whatever libido she had brewing inside her, she'd forced back through willpower and modesty; she tucked her fingers under her mini-skirt and pushed it up and down in equal doses, trying to cover her thighs while hiding the hemline of the black, satin thong peeking out underneath. She'd wiped some of the gratuitous lipstick off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara called,\" she told me. \"I told her she could join us. She's turned into...\" </span></div></div>",

I set the fruit, mushy and covered in teeth marks, back in the bowl and closed my eyes, taking that moment to breathe deeply, sorting my thoughts before I said anything brash, muddled, or plain offensive. I only heard the sound of Mom's tea cup clanking on the counter; she'd heard the same words and had the same reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the repu-- Uh... Corrine's new body, girl?\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Corrine said. She took a bite from a strawberry and swallowed it slowly. \"She's at her house now. She'll come over in about two hours with some of her clothes for me to wear, since mine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably don't fit.\" I filled her words in to save her the trouble. She nodded and went for another bite, but reconsidered and set the half-finished strawberry next to mine, both of our appetites depleted by the recent circumstance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked between us. She waited for more groundbreaking news --WAM! Her son's her daughter and her daughter's the girl you see on anti-rape PSAs; WHOA! The girl has her son's body; WA-POW! Her husband returns with the mind of Bill Clinton, etc.--and, hearing none, returned to her tea. \"I see,\" she managed to say, and left the room under an excuse to check laundry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine and I sat together in silence. I wanted to break the tension with words of wisdom, reassuring edicts about us being the same person no matter how we looked on the outside, but my mouth--Corrine's--moved noiselessly without help from the vocal chords. Corrine stared straight ahead at our kitchen curtains, twiddling her fingers and rocking on the bench, fending off her body's unseemly habits with nervous tics and bottled emotions. It occurred to me then that in these same circumstances I might have become Tara, or Corrine might have received my body while I got Ryan's, and it all seemed so arbitrary it didn't matter what body I had now. I suspected Corrine thought similarly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I had to say something. I fought the silence in my brain and laid a hand on Corrine's wrist. No matter what, my sister was still family, and we would be there for each other. I opened my mouth again; for the first time after the shift I intended to have a conversation with my sister.</span></div></div>",

I turned around and saw Tony in Ryan's body standing on the border between kitchen and living room, dripping wet, dressed in my old Rolling Stones shirt and khaki shorts two sizes too big. He kept pulling them up as he spoke. The look on his face matched the sound of his voice: meek, dejected, and humble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'up...\" he muttered. Corrine barely slid aside before he slumped down between us. Tony's hands gripped his shorts, which surprised both Corrine and I as we braced ourselves for another burst of lechery. Where was the shameless flirting? Wasn't Tony going to slap Corrine's ass and whisper something lewd as if it were romantic? Instead Tony reached for a strawberry, considered chewing it, and then decided no, he'd glare at it and, every now and then, sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be fascinating,\" I said. \"Ever study a strawberry before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony almost didn't answer. \"Mm?\" he went, and looked at me. For a moment something sparked in his eye, like the attraction I saw play out between him and Corrine, and then it vanished. He nibbled the strawberry. \"I studied your friend's face very closely,\" he said. \"I watched his eyes for a long time before I got in the shower... Just watched me in the mirror...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't recognize Tony in those words. It was a perfect imitation of Ryan whenever he started to sulk: the goofy smile would vanish from his face, he'd wax philosophic and draw out his sentences in a pained effort to sound intelligent... The way his shoulders slouched, his eyes glazed over, I saw nobody's soul in that body right then but my best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you talking about?\" Corrine laid a hand on Ryan's shoulder to stroke his hair, but she caught her mistake and withdrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got a sense of just how deep shit this is...\" Tony shook his head. \"I'm really your friend Ryan. I'm not a football player, Tara's not my girlfriend and Tara isn't even...\" He gestured weakly at Corrine. \"She's not even Tara. I just realized as I took a shower and the water hit this body and stung, that I'm not who I used to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of us are,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you still are if you want to be,\" Corrine chipped in. She was a lot more comfortable now; I could tell after that brief slip in touching his shoulder, after Tony explained his new state of mind, Corrine had a better rein on Tara's emotions. Her eyes watched Tony without an ounce of arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Tony said. \"I'm sorry I was such an ass earlier, but... I think I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe forgave him and assured each other that we were a team. Whatever new cards fate dealt us, we would draw them together. My mind reeled at my luck: Corrine and I had talked, though briefly, and engaged; Tony tapped into his inner Ryan and cooled down, enough to see we were friends, not a dweeby girl and his hot babe girlfriend; Mom returned from the basement a minute later and she seemed in higher spirits. After a rocky first hour, I could not imagine a better, more expedient resolution than what played out then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet that look Tony and I shared, the way his eyebrows furrowed and my stomach knotted... The flitting of thoughts through my head about Ryan looking cute wet... Was there something between Ryan and Corrine I didn't know about? Had it been passed on to Tony and me?</span></div></div>",

You somehow start to feel much better about yourself since leaving her body as you do not cave Ryan like she had, you do not feel weak either. But then you realise that soon enough like Corrine had you will not be able to control the feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrine...?\" She looks at you and manages to gasp \"Evan is that you in there, Oh my gosh I thought since I got my body back you would too\". You just look at her and turn to see who was in Ryan's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, you back?\" \"Nope this is it, I've finally swapped bodies, It's me Mom. Corrine I feel good for you but Evan this day seems to be getting worse for you\" she manages before resigning to go to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Corrine go into the Lounge and find that there is someone at the door, Corrine answers as you start to sit down. 'Tara's body is really sensitive' you start to think. You Sit down and a wave of excitement goes through you as you brush against your new breasts. This was going to get harder as Corrine opens the door to find Tony and Tara's best friend Allison at the door. Tony comes in and looks at you and says, \"Corrine is that you in my body still, or someone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got my own body back it's Evan in there now\" You look towards the door to find Tony's body standing there, no emotional wves go through you yet and you stay composed as you notice Allison is there also. Allison was Tara;s best friend sexually high in libido but not for males, you remembered from a distant memory that she was a lesbian and she liked you, not to say you weren't flattered you now realised that Tara as sexually promiscuous as she was, no-one had noticed that she batted towards both teams, so to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Evan\" Allison chimed in \"It's me Ryan\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey gorgeous\" you respond not able to hold back some of her speaking differences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey -Uh Tony, erm I mean Tara could we talk I don't feel too comfortable talking here, we can go to my, uh old room now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" she replies and you lead the way upstairs out the way of prying eyes. As you walk into your room and close the door behind you, you find yourself having a wave of excitement course through you as Tony (Tara) slaps your ass. You turn and find her realising what she had done trying to apologise for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry I'm sure I can fight the feelings I'm having right now...I hope\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both talk for ages about how Tara had found living as herself. As she begins to tell you memories rush through your brain as you recall certain moments in her life. She begins by telling you that she didn't like being called a slut, she didn't like her overly sized libido as it had caused her to look like what she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she talks, an incontrollable desire comes over you, and you stop her mid-sentence and say, \"Like Tara I'm feeling so hooooooorny right now, I want you to shut up and kiss me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan fight it\" she says but for some reason you can't and find yourself leaning over and kissing her full on the lips, gliding over and giving her a sexy lapdance, you realise she can't help but enjoy it as you feel her member standing to attention. You pull her trousers down and start to suck on her penis, getting a moan of delight from yourself, you stop midway as you realise what you are doing and pull away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara I'm like so sorry I couldnt help it\" you cooed, quite delightfully scary. She looked and nodded at your realisation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a second there Tony's thoughts were rushing through me, It might be safer if I get your friend Ryan to console you. You know, Tony has a weird crush on your sister, it might be easier for you if I go and talk to her rather than be here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look disgusted at this and slap her \"How dare you dump me for that little bitch, do you know who I am\" you start to shout at her. She responds with \"Do you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts course through you as she leaves and you follow her to the door and push Tony against it and try to make out with him, you get a bit of tongue in and try to grab his penis but he pushes you away and drop to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony (Tara) realises what she did and tries to help but you push her away, \"As if you rather her than me\" you begin to tear, \"I thought you were synched with me, the fact that you remembered what it was like being you, I thought I could depend on you Tara\". With that you barge past her, running down stairs in tears,.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you...   </span></div></div>",

You look at her and realise Tony was affecting you too, you found it hard to stop teasing her sexually, but you tried, only to be clumsy enough to slip and fall against her, pressing her breasts onto your muscular body, in a natural way your hand slipped around her form and brought her in closer bringing her towards the kiss, grasping her as and the other leading to her breasts.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u2026I was still listening to Mr. Tomlin, but he wasn't lecturing anymore.  Instead, he was patting himself in frenzied panic, as if trying to extinguish invisible flames.  Most of the rest of the class was staring in shock, but soon the sudden dementia seemed to spread.  I'm still not sure why it took me so long to notice what others realized immediately, but for the longest time all I could do was stare in wonderment at the hysteria erupting all around me.  I guess sitting in a desk feels pretty much like sitting in a desk no matter who you are, while watching your classmates spontaneously start groping themselves is a little more unusual.  Whatever the case, my first clue that something wasn't quite right came from the back corner of the classroom, where Edwin\u2014a gangly, pimply-faced junior who spent most of his time plotting Dungeons and Dragons campaigns during class\u2014was beating the daylights out of the football team's star tight-end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me back my body you little bastard!\"  he screamed.  \"So help me god, I'm going to fucking kill you!  You hear me, twerp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore specifically, my clue came from who stepped in to stop the fight: me.  It was then, watching myself step in and separate the two combatants, that it dawned on me.  I finally realized what had come over my classmates, and with sinking horror I looked down at myself, patting my hands frantically across my unfamiliar body just as they had.   It didn't take any grand leap of deductive reasoning to figure out whose body I now occupied\u2014there had been only one person in Mr. Tomlin's third-period class wearing a cheerleading uniform:  Stacey Everett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile as I continued to fondle myself\u2014more out of confusion than lechery or even simple curiosity\u2014my old body continued to take deceive action.  After enlisting the stunned but willing assistance of a couple of other athletes to restrain Edwin, it climbed up onto one of the desks and hammered fiercely on the wall to attract the attention of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone just shut up and sit down!\" my former body shouted.  \"We all want to find out what the hell just happened here, and we can't do that if we're going for each other's throats. You!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy old body pointed to me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Evan,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that makes sense.  I'm Stacey,\" said your old body, apparently the real Stacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you?\" she points to Edwin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tony, God dammit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.  And you?\" she points to Tony's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Edwin,\" he says.  \"But I didn't do this, I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few more pairs for confirmation, she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, people!\" she says in your voice.  \"Obviously we're way out of our league here.  I don't know who\u2014or what\u2014is responsible for this, but the most important thing right now is to stay calm.  You're scared, I get it; I'm scared too.  But right now we need to find out what's going on, and whether we're in danger.  Mr. Tomlin, is there a radio in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026I don't know,\" said Mr. Tomlin.  \"I'm not really Mr. Tomlin.  I'm Becky, from Ms. Fisher's class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, so this has clearly affected at least other parts of the school.  Our first priority then has to be to figure out just how widespread this thing is.  Are we talking about something that just hit the school or is this something bigger?  Will hospitals be open?  Police?  We need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the class sat silently, listening with rapt attention to the girl in your body.  Everyone, that is, Except Tony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\"  he demanded.  \"Who put you in charge?  You're awfully calm about this\u2014how do we know you're not responsible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous,\" said Stacey. \"No one here is capable of something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, maybe not,\" said Tony.  \"I think we need to reconsider what is and isn't possible, in light of recent developments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, people! The last thing we need right now is to start fighting over theories and speculation.  When we know something, we can act on it.  Until then, we need to stick together!  Now, who has a working cell phone?  We need someone to scout out the rest of the school, see how far this thing has spread.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, I glanced at the open leather bag beside my seat, and the slim pink phone sitting within.  It struck me that Stacey would obviously know about her own phone, but then I'd have been very surprised if anyone in this class didn't have one.  What she was really looking for were volunteers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now, I'm not exactly the adventurous type by nature.  I certainly didn't want to go exploring what essentially amounted to a disaster area just minutes after the most traumatizing event of my life.  That said, there was something about the way Stacey was behaving that made me change my mind..  The way she took control, demonstrated leadership in a moment of genuine crisis\u2014all while using my body.  It made me realize that I could have done that.  That I could have been courageous, could have been the hero\u2014not just now but my whole life.  She literally had nothing I didn't have, and look what she was making of it!  So I decided to do something courageous myself: I'd go out and scout.  After starting to trade phone numbers with Stacey\u2014and then realizing we didn't need to\u2014I exited the math classroom and stepped into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, it was a little disappointing.  I'd been half-expecting to step out into fires, rioting and mass anarchy, but the hallway looked for the most part just as it always had.  No apocalyptic messages scrawled in blood on the walls, no bands of roving vigilantes wielding shotguns and spiked clubs\u2014just a row of lockers and a drinking fountain.  I also didn't exactly feel like much of a heroic explorer myself.  As I strode down the hallway, paying as much attention to the unsettling fluttering of my cheerleading skirt, the distracting play of blonde hair across my vision and the boisterous jiggling of certain other bits of my new body as to my surroundings.  Despite the gravity of the whole situation, I felt somehow ridiculous walking around even empty halls looking like a cheerleader.  Still, my sense of dignity wasn't too great to settle one question that had been the subject of furious debate among my friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" I muttered after twisting everything back into position.  \"Ryan was right\u2014she is a D cup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" said Stacey over the cell phone.  \"What's it like out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty quiet,\" I replied.  \"Not much to see so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check the other classrooms,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Empty, so far,\" I replied.  \"Looks like everyone cleared out right after the event.  They were definitely affected, though.  I'm seeing lots of abandoned stuff\u2014backpacks and purses, mostly.  It's all pretty neat, though; no obvious destruction I can see. I'm going to check the cafeteria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, however, I decided to take a little detour.  Popping into the bathroom\u2014the men's, not that it mattered now\u2014I wanted to take a moment to look at myself in the large mirrors.  I should have realized, however, that I wouldn't be the only one with this idea.  At least twenty other people were already in the bathroom, jostling for position in front of the sinks.  The scene here was a lot more like what I'd expected\u2014taps were on, papers and bags were strewn all over the floor, and people were shoving, shouting, and generally on the verge of riot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've found some people,\" I said into the phone.  \"They're in the bathrooms.  They're practically rioting in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send someone to deal with it.  Keep going, get to the administration wing.  See if you can find a radio, or someone who knows what's going on. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I reached the Admin wing, I'd already passed several other groups of people.  Mostly small groups\u2014one or two people looking for their friends\u2014but there were a few larger units as well.  It seemed the band, of all things, was sticking together and doing their best to break up fights and generally keep order.  Meanwhile, someone somewhere had apparently activated the city's emergency warning system, and the sound of klaxons cut through the air\u2014not helping to alleviate the general state of panic one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office itself was practically empty.  The apparent principal was locked in his office watching a small TV, while the rest of the remaining staff were huddled around a bright-orange hand-crank radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026origins of the event are as yet unknown, the Department of Defense has informed us that the phenomenon is not the result of enemy or terrorist action.  As of 11:32 a.m., the event has crossed into the Pacific Ocean, leaving only a handful of islands still unaffected.  It is projected that the event will reach those remaining locations within the hour, and\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of relaying the radio's updates to Stacey, she called me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've heard enough.\" She said.  \"We have bigger issues right now.  Edwin's returned with some of the people from the bathroom\u2014there are some injuries.  We're going to need first aid supplies.  There should be some in the office, but I can send a team to get them.  I need you to help with a bigger problem:  we need a bigger room.  It's getting too crowded in here, and tempers are going to get short fast.  We need somewhere else to stay, and quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.  Where should I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's up to you.  You know better than I do what it's like out there.  Use your best judgment, and we'll go where you decide.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I didn't find any medical supplies there, just two girls fighting and what appeared to be the beginning of a mosh pit enveloping them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing you empty handed, I kind of figured the cafeteria was a no-go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hence, the grocery store.\" You pointed with your thumb and forefinger, both tipped with a cutesy pink polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's get in your car and head over there.\" Stacey proposed, causing you to stop in your tracks behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you had a car? I was following you, after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey sighed, placing her hands on her hips and striking an exasperated pose. \"So neither of us has a car.\" Before you can reply, she adds, \"Wait! There's that pharmacy that just opened over on Waterfront Street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea!\" You exclaimed. How did you not think of it before? It's only a twenty minute walk from the high school. \"If we hurry, there might still be some things we can use. Gauze dressings, penicillin, plasters, painkillers... even a bottle of aspirin would help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the two of you made your way to the local pharmacy. The streets were strikingly quiet, a far cry from the post-apocalyptic landscape you expected to see. No roving bands of armored cars, no pirates wielding golf clubs atop trucks with snow plows attached. Just a handful of people wandering about, keeping to themselves as they stared at their bodies in confusion. Whatever happened to you and Stacey and the rest of the school, confirmed by the radio broadcast, was indeed real. Real and widespread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSide-stepping a car that had crashed into a wall, you enter the pharmacy behind Stacey. For good measure, she bends down to grab a crutch, wielding it like a weapon just in case anybody got any ideas. Not about her... not the way she looked now as a fairly imposing young man. No. Glancing at the boy wearing her petite body dressed in the cheerleader uniform she threw on this morning, as she loomed over her old body by a full head now. For him. Her. Whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't waste any time on the shelves, all the important stuff is behind the counter.\" You call out to Stacey, setting down a shopping basket and lifting your butt onto the counter, sliding your legs over and landing on the other side. Straightening out your skirt, you frown. \"What I wouldn't give for a pair of sweatpants right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hurry up!\" Stacey said. \"I think I see someone coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you begin opening drawers and cabinets, looking for whatever medicines might be helpful in case somebody gets hurt back at the school, Stacey sees an elderly man approach her. He looked to be in his seventies, balding, wearing a white coat and spectacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what in the world do you think you're doing, young man?\" He screeched, his thick bristly mustache contorting angrily. \"I get back from the restroom and the world's gone all topsy-turvey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back sir. I don't want any trouble...\" Stacey said, her tone authoritative and commanding with the help of your deeper voice. Brandishing the crutch and studying it on the old man, she asked, \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I?\" The old man shrieked. \"I'm Elbert Goodman, I own Goodman's Pharmacy. What are you doing, hoodlum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould this old man not know about people switching bodies? Stacey replied, \"You mean... you haven't switched with anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what's going on? My med tech Caroline just started raving and acting all crazy, then she left after making a mess over in aisle three. Ruined my uniform, so I went in the back to get changed into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured over to one side of the pharmacy. Broken glassware, shelves empty, puddles and packages covering the checkerboard tiling. Stacey lowered her weapon and introduced herself. She took time telling him what she knew while you filled up a second basket with paper bags, pillboxes, an inhaler, even a chilled case of insulin vials... just in case medical supplies become scarce for a few days. Hoping this whole thing would end soon, like a bad dream, and not turn into something longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's that girl doing back there? Some people really need that!\" Goodman cried, but Stacey held him back calmly. She replied, \"I just told you, that 'girl' is really Evan, the owner of this body. And there's a lot more like us over at the high school. We promise to pay for these things later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Stacey!\" You called out, leaning your back against the emergency exit. \"I need your help carrying some of this stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" Stacey leaps over the counter with Goodman in pursuit. He's too old to climb across the counter, and he fumbles with his keys unlocking the door as you and Stacey set off the alarms exiting out the back of the pharmacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey whooped. \"Ha! What a rush! Did you see the look on his face? I thought he was about to call the police!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou adjust your grip on the basket handles and pant, \"Yeah... But if he did call the police, who would answer?\" You let Stacey carry most of the weight on the way back to the school. Looking behind you, several other people are fighting in front of the pharmacy. Goodman doesn't seem to be one of them, you sigh gratefully. You met him once before at a parade last year. He's a kind old man whose wife died several years ago and didn't have much awaiting him in retirement, so he decided to start up a local pharmacy for the townspeople. You hope he stays safe amid all of this craziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Stacey, I thought everybody was affected by what just happened? But not Goodman, apparently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked ahead a few steps and stopped. \"You're right, Evan. Maybe some people stayed in their original bodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey continued, as you followed behind her. \"I don't even know why we switched. Don't get me wrong. You're a nice guy, but we didn't run in the same social circles, y'know? Like, if school was a rain forest we would be on two totally different canopies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange analogy, but she was right. Left unsaid was which of you two occupied the higher social strata. It didn't need to be said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around with a look of guilt. \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense taken,\" You replied coolly. \"Let's change the subject. I could tell you enjoyed using my body to keep that old man under control just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mood brightened considerably at that. \"Gosh, yes! I just felt powerful in a way I've never felt before. So strong, and everything's so much lighter now.\" She giggled. \"But it's a physical kind of strength, y'know? Growing up I was able to command attention by showing off my body. Cheerleading was just a natural fit, come to think of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to say that.\" You agreed. Stacey's curvaceous body was the subject of every boy's locker room conversation since the dawn of time. Her athletic, toned figure combined with a pair of grapefruit-sized breasts meant she could be the queen bee of the high school if she wanted. Or captain of the cheer squad. Or prom queen. She never wanted that kind of spotlight it seemed. But the ravenous looks of hormone-drenched young men were tossed her way all the same. A fact that the Ashley Smythe's and Trina Peterson's of the world loathed with a passion. This fact you knew only from second-hand sources, whispered through that Amazonian grapevine as it trickled past you on its way down even to the dregs at the Anime Club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking control in Mr. Tomlin's room earlier this morning... that was pretty inspiring.\" You admitted to her finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey blushed, twirling her short-cropped hair uselessly. \"Oh, that? That was just crowd control. You get used to that as a cheerleader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought it was impressive.\" You continued, before setting down the baskets momentarily and letting the blood flow back into your rail-thin arms. \"I tried to do the same thing in the cafeteria. No luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of it comes down to confidence.\" She said seriously. \"You'd be surprised how people respond to a person who exudes confidence and self respect.\" Approaching this subject more carefully, she added, \"I've seen you get pushed around by Tony Coletta in the hallway a few times. If you stand up for yourself, that asshole will back down. There's a thousand boys like him; the only way for them to feel secure is by making others feel insecure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your cheeks redden. She was absolutely right, but what the hell? If Ryan said that, you could laugh it off and waste him later playing Modern Warfare. But Stacey, almost a total stranger, sensed what you preferred not to admit even to yourself. Despite being a cheerleader, she seemed remarkably perceptive at reading people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't worry about me, Stacey. I can take care of myself.\" You shoot back in a tone much icier than you intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't say anything, so you walk in silence for a few minutes before returning to the school. What happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Returning to the high school, you see conditions largely unchanged. The klaxons were still piercing the cool morning air. A poster announcing the upcoming football game was torn and blackened from a recently extinguished flame. Textbooks and loose leaf paper were littered about the floors. You and Stacey pass a couple boys who were holding each other and crying. An Anime club girl Marie Martin was yanking the hair of Ana Garcia, a sophomore in your Biology class. Stacey separated the two roughly while you sat down on a nearby bench alongside the medical supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet were killing you. Stacey's strappy sandals were not designed for long distance walking, and you could feel a blister on your heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to find the nurse,\" Stacey announced, \"Hopefully she hasn't switched with anybody and she can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I saw her in the counselor's office a moment ago.\" Ana said, who actually turned out to be Joey Verdugo, a scrappy kid on the freshman baseball team. He massaged his wavy brunette hair and sat down next to you and Marie (actually Ana). This being like the only time the bodies of these three girls would ever be caught sitting together: You, Joey, and Ana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're really Evan in Stacey's body?\" Said Joey, still in shock about the switch. He burst out laughing, \"That's awesome! So she like a D cup or a double D? C'mon dude, I gotta know, you know, for science or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna cuffed Joey as he yelped out in pain. \"<i>Callate, pendejo</i>! Stop making my body sound so estupid.\" You shrugged your shoulders helplessly at the Hispanic girl currently inhabiting the body of the geeky, stick-thin <i>otaku </i>with dyed blue hair. It was weird hearing Marie talking with a thick accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Stacey returned with Nurse McMillan, remarkably still in her own body. She had been dialing the school superintendent in the counselor's office without success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least someone is thinking proactively around here. Good work, Stacey.\" She smiled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can thank Evan, he's the one who gathered all that stuff.\" You feel yourself blushing again, flicking golden blonde bangs out of your eyes and indicating each of the items you borrowed from Goodman's Pharmacy. 'Borrowed' being the operative word... the nurse was glad enough to see someone else acting level headed, she didn't ask questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I take some of this antiseptic and bandages?\" She asked. \"The Wilson boy, or whoever is inside his body, fell down the stairs and broke an ankle. I feel like we could use all the supplies we can get.\" You and Stacey decide to transport all the medicines into her office, as she probably could make better use of it anyhow. A few students help Tommy Wilson hobble into the office, and you could hardly hear anything else above his bawling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do now?\" Stacey asks you. \"This place is close to getting out of control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the boy's compound fracture sobered you up quite a bit. Exciting as this might be, safety was still a top concern. What if something happened like that to your younger sister, Corinne? You haven't seen her since this morning, when Mom dropped the two of you off for school. She went to her third period class, Algebra, as you went off to Mr. Tomlin's class before all this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to find my sister, Corinne!\" You tell Stacey. Before she can give you your own cell phone, you fish Stacey's pink phone out of her purse and dial Corinne's number. Placing the receiver to your pierced ear, you hear your sister's voice on the other line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corinne, is that you? It's me, Evan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan? You sound like a girl.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've become Stacey Everett. Long story. Are you safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really loud over here. Lots of students panicking. The teacher's out cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay on the line, I'll come and get you.\" You motion for Stacey to follow you. Corinne's Algebra class is on the other end of the school, on the second floor. Your feet still hurt but she's your kid sister. Mom would kill you if you failed to keep her safe in a time like this. Which brings up another unsettling thought: What about Mom? Was she affected?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey wanted to get your attention for a moment. Walking beside her, you place the phone against your chest to muffle the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan, how do you know that's really your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? You heard her on the line?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I heard was her voice. Anybody could have swapped with her and is using her body right now. Do you have some way to know for sure? Like a test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, a pit forming in your stomach. She made a good point. It was no longer safe to assume the soul matched the body. And estimating how pervasive this mass-switching had affected the school, odds were against anybody claiming they were unaffected. The exceptions, like Goodman and Nurse McMillan, being just that: exceptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place the phone back to your ear. \"Sorry Corinne, had to settle a scuffle between a couple of students just now. Are you still in class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please hurry Evan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my way. I called Mom and she hasn't swapped with anyone, thank God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" You continued, \"I haven't heard from Dad since this morning. Last thing he said was he was going to the hardware store to get some irrigation tubing for the backyard. Do you think he's made it home yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause on the line. She replied, \"Don't worry about it Evan. I'm sure Dad's fine. Knowing Mom, she will let us know when he gets home safely. Are you close yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Click.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop in your tracks and hold down your phone. Stacey glances at you with a look of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't her, was it?\" She mumbled breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Was all you said. Corinne would never have said that. Your father has been out of the picture for, what, 10 years now? God knows where he is, probably not a hardware store. Whoever was pretending to be Corinne was doing a decent job, but she (he?) fell into the bear trap you laid for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey seemed to realize it without needing to ask. She embraced you in her bigger arms, holding you tightly. \"I'm so sorry, Evan. I didn't know...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniffed. Eyes wet. You felt a tear stream down your cheek. Why these tears? You haven't felt anything for the old man in ages. Yet, you just felt like crying. The tension and drama of the day finally caught up to you. Remarkably, Stacey holds you close and rubs your back warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there.\" She cooed. \"Fuck them. We'll find Corinne no matter what it takes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stacy says, \"Is that your parents' car?\" and your attention is diverted to the SUV sitting in the driveway. Your mom's, which she drives to work every day around eleven o'clock. It was about ten thirty when the Great Shift struck, which means she hadn't left when everything went to hell, and there was a good chance she--or at least her body--might still be home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's Mom's,\" I said. \"Do you mind if I check that she's all right?

You both have started calling each other by the names that actually correspond to the body you were currently inhabiting. That was...interesting. As was the fact that you were noticing things that you never would have thought about before. Like Evans arms, which actually were kind of muscular looking. They looked very nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Evan was looking at me now, following my gaze to his arms with narrowed eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at the realisation I had just been caught checking out a guy (and myself to boot if you really want to get into it). What was happening to me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvans voice had dropped in pitch and gotten deeper. I felt a small shudder race through me when I heard it. He noticed and a small, dorky grin spread across his face. OK, so I wasn't the only one whose thoughts and feelings were changing to adapt to our new bodies. Apparently Stacy was now starting to think and act like me and I was starting to feel like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...ya...kinda...\" The blush was getting worse as Evan stepped in closer, pressing our bodies together a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt his hands grip my hips and I gasped as he tugged right up against him. Almost instinctually my slender arms circled around his neck and I found myself looking up into those eyes, and focusing on those lips. They looked so soft... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I was thinking...\" Evan squeezed y hips a little and I actually giggled. \"Maybe we could...I mean we are probably stuck like this for a while, and maybe we could..help each other, you know, adjust to our new bodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis statement all came out in a nervous rush, and the accompanying blush was even more evident than my own. My gosh, it was adorable how nervous he seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked. My gosh? Since when did I say things like that? This was getting weird...still Evan had a point. It couldn't hurt to...explore. Just a tiny bit. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bit my lower lip and looked up at him with wide eyes. I licked my glossy lips nervously and saw the heat in his gaze as he followed the path of my tongue. It sent another deliscious shudder through me to see him looking at me like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I think...\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He grabbed my shoulder and ground my strut to a standstill. \"Why're you pulling this on me, Evan? Is this a joke? It's not a very funny joke, if it is. You were the one person in the classroom I thought I could trust, who was in control of themselves, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, jeez! I didn't mean nothing bad. No need to get frigid,\" I muttered, giving Stacy's stomach a light slap while I lowered her cheerleader blouse, just an inch, to make her cleavage more visible. \"Don't mind me being my sexy self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit me. What came so naturally I didn't even pay attention to what I was doing or saying flashed through my mind in all its foreign, unusual nature. Stacy stared at me, mouth agape. His hands clenched and unclenched themselves, and he stood rigidly in place. I lowered my eyes, pulled my shirt back up and nudged the bra back where it had been before, underplaying the size of my breast. God, I felt like crying right then, I was so embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater--much later, when the authorities finally decided to stop asking questions and start looking for answers--I discovered the cause of my jarring mental shift. Stacy was not, by nature, a flirtatious or even slightly promiscuous girl. She had her steady boyfriends, along with the occasional, short-lived flings which ended for a variety of reasons, none of which were sleeping around or wanting to get laid by someone else. Stacy respected the boys in her life even when they didn't respect her, and wanted to make her relationships work, in spite of all their flaws. So I was not, as was the case with some, adopting Stacy's personality. Rather, my male mind was trying to reconcile itself to the presence of female hormones running through its system, pumping into my brain as they always did before. Only now, not sure how to react, the hormones' effects were amplified: very minor thoughts about looking pretty and considering a boy cute blew up to epic proportions, in a burlesque exaggeration of Stacy's normal behavior. With time, I would learn how to handle the new chemical processes in my body, and the reactions would weaken until I no longer blew kisses at guys I passed on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time, as confused as Stacy and everyone else, I said, \"Stacy, I'm sorry. I...I don't know what came over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seriously want me to believe that?\" Stacy fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want to, fine!

When I regained consciousness, I was no longer in the cafeteria; I was now cowering inside a bathroom stall.  Wondering what was going on, I looked down and saw a pair of breasts poking out from a somewhat revealing top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the urge to get up, I slowly climbed to my feet; only to find myself having trouble balancing.  A quick glance downward showed I was now wearing a pair of boots.  After steadying myself, I slowly walked out of the stall to the sinks.  Looking in the mirror, I saw a girl with dark blonde hair.  I immediately recognized her as Ashley Sawyer, a member of the cheer squad and one of the most popular girls in the 10 grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone at school knew about Ashley; she was an only child and was spoiled by her parents.  =Her father was a businessman and her mom was a professor at the local college.  Along with her friends Allison Martin and Erica Collins, she was one of the popular girls that every boy wanted to date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter staring at the reflection for a while, I decided that the best thing to do was get back together with Stacey and the others.  After grabbing Ashley\u2019s purse, in the hopes she had a cell phone, I walked out of the bathroom.  After taking a few unsteady steps in the boots, I\u2019d managed to figure out how to walk in them.  As I walked down the hall, I tried calling Stacey but found the cell service was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made my way towards the area where I\u2019d last seen her, but when I got there I saw a bunch of kids rioting.  Seeing that, I started to worry about Corinne; she was here somewhere and probably in danger.  But it occurred to me that I was also in danger; what was stopping the rioters from harming me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, I decided to forget Stacey and figure out a way to stay safe.  Once I was safe, I\u2019d decided, then I would figure out how to find Corinne.  As I made my way to the front of the building, I began to think of my next course of action.  The logical thing to do was to go to my house, but it was 20 minutes away from here and I would be even less safe out there then I was in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not sure why I ultimately decided not to go home; I mean Eric thought to go to my place, but for some reason, I felt like I should not go there.  After a few moments of indecision, I decided that going to Ashley\u2019s place was the best bet.  She lived in a gated subdivision about 10 minutes from here; I figured that would give me some protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked down the street, I saw all sorts of chaos; car crashes, buildings on fire and people running around in a panic.  Thankfully, no one seemed to pay attention to me.  I arrived at Ashley\u2019s subdivision a few minutes later; walking through the remains of the front gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing screaming and explosions in the distance, I ran the rest of the way to Ashley\u2019s house.  With Ashley\u2019s parents out of town, I figured no one would have a problem with me spending the night.  Arriving at the front door, I dug through Ashley\u2019s purse and found her keys.</span></div></div>",

Placing Ashley\u2019s purse on a nearby table, I walked into the family room. Ashley was known for thrown parties at her house when her parents weren\u2019t around, but since I was considered unpopular I never received an invitation.  I would never have thought my first time in her house would be when I was in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the family room, I was mildly surprised by how modest it was.  There was a high-end TV on the wall but it looked about 45 inches.  On a shelf next to the TV, I saw pictures of Ashley at various ages.  Seeing her vacation photos, I started to get jealous of her. I had a crappy home life, my mom worked just enough to provide for my family, and I had not been on a vacation in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut looking at the photos, I could see Ashley having the time of her life in places like the Bahamas or skiing in the mountains.  I could not help but wonder how such a spoiled brat got everything when I had nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the kitchen, feeling thirsty, I grabbed a water bottle from the fridge.  Exploring the house a little more, I eventually found Ashley\u2019s room.  It seemed this was where her parents spent most of their money; she had a 40\u201d TV on the wall and a closet full of what looked to be expensive clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down on the bed, which proved to be very comfortable, as I heard explosions and screams in the distance.  As I heard those, I realized that I was now in a girl\u2019s body; I had to make sure that I was not in harm's way.  After running to ensure that all the windows and doors were locked, I went back up to Ashley\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying on the bed, careful not to squish my chest, I closed my eyes and hoped to fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

Heading downstairs, I went into the kitchen to see what there was to eat in the fridge.  After making a sandwich and grabbing a soda, I walked into the family room and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning on the tv, I ate my sandwich while watching the news about what was happening.  They were calling it the Great Shift; apparently, 90% of the world\u2019s population had been affected by it; plus another 50% from what they referred to as aftershocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do not know what caused this idea to come into my head; but for some reason, I started to think of this Shift as a way to improve my life.  Sure I\u2019d have to adjust to being a girl;, but in the long run that didn\u2019t seem so hard to do.  As I looked around the living room, it occurred to me that I could take Ashley\u2019s life as my own; I could become a new and improved Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it all hinged on whether or not she came back to claim her life.  But personally, that was a risk worth taking.  On the downside it meant never being able to tell my mom and sister the truth; they\u2019d think I was missing, or dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat on the couch, eating my sandwich, I decided to _______.</span></div></div>",

Maybe once everything died down, I could reach out to them; but I knew I\u2019d have to do it in a way that didn\u2019t reveal I was really Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if worrying about my family wasn\u2019t bad enough; I found it nearly impossible to find a comfortable position on Ashley\u2019s bed.  No matter how I slept, either on my back or on my stomach, I had to contend with my new breasts.  After tossing and turning for the last 45 minutes, I finally gave in and sat up in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at my chest, I said, \u201cIf I\u2019m going to pull this off, I have to get used to having these things on my chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of bed, I walked over to the dresser and opened the drawers until I found the one holding the bras.

I found myself hesitating for a brief moment until I sucked it up and took off my top; giving me my first unobstructed view of a girl\u2019s chest.  \u201cYou know, in all the times I imagined this, I never expected the breasts to be mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt some doing but I managed to get the old bra off and replace it with the sports bra.

It did not take long for me to realize it was coming from me; I was covered in sweat and grime from yesterday. \u201cFirst things first; I have to take a shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked down the hall to the bathroom, it occurred to me that I now had the perfect opportunity to check out my new body. Once I closed the door and started to get undressed, I found myself thinking about Ashley; specifically how she would react if she knew what I was doing. It did not take me long to realize that it did not matter how she reacted; this was my body now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was undressed, I turned to the mirror and got my first good look at my new body. Doing my best impression of model posing, I said, \u201cDamn, I\u2019m one good looking girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of posing, I turned the shower on and stepped inside.</span></div></div>",

Everything was so sensitive, to the point where I had to lean against the wall to calm down.  It was not all for pleasure though, I did make sure to clean where I could; for now deciding to avoid my chest and groin area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I figured I\u2019d had enough, I turned the shower off and dried off. Wrapping myself in a towel, like I\u2019d seen Corinne do many times, I left the bathroom. I was about to head back to my room when the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering who it was, ignoring the fact that I was wearing nothing but a towel, I went downstairs. I cautiously peeked out the window to find Megan Sullivan and Kelly Rogers standing on the porch.  They were Ashley\u2019s best friends and, now that I was taking over for Ashley, I guess that made them my best friends as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, suddenly not caring that I was wearing nothing but a towel, I put on my best impersonation of Ashley and said, \u201cMegan?  Kelly?  Is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it\u2019s us; more or less.\u201d Gesturing to Kelly, Megan said, \u201cI\u2019m actually Kelly, we ended up in each other\u2019s bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, in Kelly\u2019s body, looked at me and said, \u201cAre you still Ashley; or someone from school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still me; whatever swapped you guys didn\u2019t affect me.\u201d Stepping aside, gesturing for them to come in, I said, \u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were hiding out at school until things died down.\u201d Walking inside, Kelly said, \u201cYour place was closer, so we thought we\u2019d come here.  I honestly didn\u2019t expect to see you here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door, I said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you guys are safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to you yesterday?\u201d looking at me, Megan said, \u201cThe last time we saw you; you were heading to the locker room for gym class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew I had to come up with a convincing story to tell them.  After a moment, I said, \u201cI\u2019d just gotten to the gym when everything went crazy.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI like panicked and before I knew it, I was standing in my driveway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you heard from your folks yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dawned on me that I had not thought about Ashley\u2019s parents since this all started.  My plan to take over Ashley\u2019s life was fine; but not if I ended up as an orphan.  \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything yet, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll call when they can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re totally fine.\u201d Looking at me, Megan said, \u201cDo you have anything to eat?  Neither of us has had anything since yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably some leftover pizza from last night, you can have some of that.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cHelp yourself to the food; I\u2019m going to get dressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Megan and Kelly walked to the kitchen, I made my way upstairs; feeling excited that I\u2019d fooled them into thinking I was Ashley.</span></div></div>",

It took only a few minutes for me to decide on an outfit; a tennis skirt and a top that showed off a little cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as I put on the top, I wondered who I was wearing it for; I was pretty sure Megan and Kelly were straight.  It quickly dawned on me that perhaps some of Ashley\u2019s personality was seeping in; she\u2019d always wear something like this to school.  <i>Maybe blending it won\u2019t be so hard after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding a decent pair of shoes to go with the outfit, I left the room to join Megan and Kelly downstairs.

Looking at them, acting as Ashley would, I said, \u201cAm I hot or what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You look great!\u201d shocked, Megan said, \u201cI-I thought for sure you\u2019d need a few tries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ve never done anything like this before?\u201d standing up, Kelly said, \u201cI won\u2019t make fun of you if you did; <br>\r\nI\u2019m just curious because it seems like you\u2019ve got some experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never dressed in girl\u2019s clothing until yesterday.\u201d Looking at them, my hands on my hips, I said, \u201cTo be honest I\u2019m, like noticing some of Ashley\u2019s personality taking over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them exchanged glances with each other.  Looking at me, Megan said, \u201cWhat do you mean exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast night, after I decided to take Ashley\u2019s identity, I found myself getting excited at the idea of boy\u2019s flirting with <i>me</i> at school.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cThen in the bathroom earlier, without even thinking about it, I spent 10 minutes taking selfies in the mirror.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat explains a few things; about you and the two of us.\u201d Turning to Megan, Kelly said, \u201cEver since this morning, I\u2019ve been having these cravings for Cherry Garcia ice cream.  I always hated that flavor, until I remembered it was your favorite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I was going crazy!\u201d chuckling, Kelly looked at Megan and said, \u201cLast night, I had a dream where I was making out with Jake Collins behind the bleachers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the confused look on my face, Megan explained, \u201cJake Collins is like my dream guy, but Kelly doesn\u2019t like him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seriously don\u2019t like Jake Collins?\u201d turning to Kelly, I said, \u201cHe\u2019s like the cutest boy on the football team!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I realized what I\u2019d said, Kelly looked at me and said, \u201cYeah, you definitely have some of Ashley\u2019s personality; she fawned over Jake just as much as Megan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, like what do we do now?\u201d looking at them, I said, \u201cWith Ashley\u2019s personality merging with mine, I don\u2019t think we need any more lessons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d Pausing, Kelly said, \u201cThe only thing left if for you to learn more about Ashley\u2019s life and family; but you don\u2019t need our help for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t answer <i>her</i> question, Kel.\u201d Taking a breath, Megan said, \u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking note of the fact that Megan referred to me as <i>her</i>, I smiled a little.  Thinking for a moment, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s a nice day out, we could totally work on our tans in the backyard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan to me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Opening my eyes, I was briefly confused by the pair of breasts poking up through the blanket I was wrapped in.  My confusion was short lived when I remembered the events from yesterday; how I had found myself in the body of Ashley Sawyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up on the couch, I thought back to my decision to take Ashley\u2019s life for my own.  It wasn\u2019t too late for me to change my mind, especially since no one knew what I\u2019d decided.  As I sat on the couch, I thought about the pros and cons of my decision; in an attempt to convince myself it was the right choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the con side, my family would think that I\u2019m dead.  As bad as my home life was, I was having a hard time moving past that particular hurdle.  Corinne and I would still be attending the same school; only I\u2019d be going as a girl who hates her, I\u2019d have to continue that act until I graduated in 3 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side, I\u2019d be one of the most popular kids in school.  Even if it meant being one of the hottest girls in the 10th grade, I couldn\u2019t pass that opportunity up.  I knew there were factors that I\u2019d have to learn to live with; being a cheerleader and dating boys came to mind.  But those were all small prices to pay for popularity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from the couch, I decided then and there that I\u2019d made the right decision.  I was going to be Ashley Sawyer for the rest of my life.  I just had to make sure I didn\u2019t slip up or I could be in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked out of the family room, and towards the kitchen, it was only then that I realized there was no power in the house.  After checking a few switches, I briefly thought about going to find the circuit breaker.  I stopped myself when I realized that I\u2019d have to act like Ashley at home as well; it didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out she wouldn\u2019t think to check the breakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after I poured myself a glass of milk, I walked upstairs to what was now my bedroom.  As I stood in the doorway, I started to think what I should do next.  I was pretty sweaty, and dirty, from yesterday\u2019s chaos; so part of me wanted to take a shower.  Another part of me thought it would be a good idea to start learning about my new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over for a moment, I decided to _____.</span></div></div>",

Even as I closed the door, I realized that taking a shower without power would deplete the water heater.  However, the thought of seeing Ashley\u2019s naked body was enough to keep me from really worrying about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I turned the shower on, I turned to face the mirror as I started to undress.  I was surprised by my initial hesitation but moved past it when I realized it was my body now.  Soon enough I was down to wearing only the bra and undies.  I was admiring my new figure in the mirror when I noticed something strange on my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, I saw something poking out from behind the bra.  Pulling on it, I was surprised to realize it was a falsie.  After taking out the other one, I looked at the reflection in the mirror and was surprised by the difference.  I, like most of the boys in school, had assumed Ashley\u2019s breasts were real; but to find out she had been faking it this whole time disappointed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst thing I\u2019m doing once everything settles down is ask my parents for implants.\u201d  Holding both breasts in my hands, I looked at my reflection and said, \u201cI\u2019d hate for anyone to find out that I wear falsies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stood there, I was suddenly shocked by what I\u2019d said.  I\u2019d only been a girl for not even a day, and I was already starting to think as Ashley would.  On the one hand, it would make taking over for her that much easier; but on the other, I was worried about losing the parts of Eric\u2019s personality that I liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging all that off, I continued to get undressed and got into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll tell you one thing about my shower experience; I now understood why Corinne occasionally liked to take long showers.  This new body was so sensitive, I knew I\u2019d made the right choice in keeping it for myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t all pleasure however, I did make an effort to wash.  Once that was all finished, I dried myself off and made my way to my room.  I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what I wanted to wear for my first full day as Ashley, so I grabbed a few choices and placed them on the bed.  After putting on a new bra and undies, making sure to put the falsies in, I went back to the bed to look over my options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A \u2013 short skirt with a tight fitting top; with a pair of knee-high boots<br>\r\nOption B \u2013 something more conservative; a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt<br>\r\nOption C \u2013 a skirt with a revealing top<br>\r\nOption D \u2013 a nice strapless dress that showed off my figure</span></div></div>",

I wasn\u2019t ready to wear something so revealing, no matter how attractive it would make me look.  After thinking it over for a few moments, I decided to combine some of the choices into one outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, I was standing in front of the mirror wearing a tennis skirt with a top that showed off a bit of cleavage.  Even though I wasn\u2019t sure how to walk in them, I did decide to go with the knee-high boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at myself in the mirror, I couldn\u2019t help but think I was getting the hang of being a girl.  I was about to put the other clothes away when I heard a knock at the front door.  Wondering who it was I slowly, and somewhat unsteadily, walked down the stairs.  A quick glance through the window brought on a brief feeling of happiness to my faces.  Standing at the front door was Stacey Everett and my sister Corinne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of happiness was replaced with confusion; because although Ashley and Stacey were on the squad together, they never hung out.  To have Corinne hear with Stacey was even more confusing.  Opening the door, making sure to put on my best Ashley impersonation, I said, \u201cStacey? Corinne?  Like what are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Corinne said, \u201cAshley, please tell me you\u2019re still you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot necessarily. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s still me.\u201d Confused, I said, \u201cWhat are you two doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh, it\u2019s us!\u201d gesturing to Olivia, Stacey said, \u201cI\u2019m Megan and that\u2019s Kelly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan Rogers and Kelly Sullivan were Ashley\u2019s best friends; the three of them were considered the hottest girls in the 10th grade.  To my surprise, I found myself relieved that it wasn\u2019t actually Corinne standing in front of me.  Looking at Megan, in Stacey\u2019s body, I said, \u201cOh my God!  I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re in that loser Stacey\u2019s body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Pouting, Megan said, \u201cAll that work I put into keeping my body thin; and, like, I end up in Stacey\u2019s flabby body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to bite my tongue for a moment; Stacey was far from flabby.  She was in great shape, and I\u2019m not saying that because I spent a portion of yesterday in her body.  Turning to Kelly, I said, \u201cIt must be torture for you, being in that loser\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me, it totally is.\u201d Frowning, Kelly said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s worse; being in her body or the thought that she\u2019s in mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to defend Corinne but knew that, by doing so, I\u2019d blow my cover.  \u201cHopefully that loser realizes how lucky she is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after the three of us found ourselves in the family room; going over the events since yesterday.  It seemed that Megan had initially found herself in the body of Tara Johnson, the school slut; while Kelly had found herself in the body of Jake Simmons, the captain of the football team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like me, they\u2019d been affected by the aftershocks.  When it came to be my turn, I had to bend the truth a little and say that I was in the bathroom when it happened.  Seeing the turmoil in the school, I decided to come home for safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least one of us was lucky not to be affected.\u201d Looking at me, Kelly said, \u201cCan you imagine ending up in some losers body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not think about that.\u201d Getting up. I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get myself some soda; do you want some?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exchanging a glance with Kelly, Megan said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re fine.\u201d Gesturing to her body, Megan said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to get Stacey\u2019s body down to where mine was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into the kitchen soon after.  As I was pouring myself a glass of soda, I was suddenly approached by Kelly.  Before I could react, she knocked the glass out of my hands.  Seeing the broken glass on the floor, I said, \u201cLike what the hell, Kelly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can drop the act now.\u201d As Megan entered the room, Kelly said, \u201cWe know you\u2019re not really Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d trying to think of a way out, I said, \u201cOf course I\u2019m Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you were really Ashley, then you wouldn\u2019t be drinking soda.\u201d Looking at me, Kelly said, \u201cShe hasn\u2019t had soda in years; because she says it messes with her figure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the angry looks on their faces, I knew I was caught.  Taking a step back, I said, \u201cOkay fine, I\u2019m not Ashley.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m Evan Rogers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do Kelly &amp; Megan React?</span></div></div>",

Retrieving Allison\u2019s purse from the stall, I dug through until I found her cellphone.  After taking a few unsteady steps in the boots, I managed to leave the bathroom.  Looking around, making sure the coast was clear, I tried to call Stacey but found there was no longer any service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting my bearings, realizing I wasn\u2019t far from the library, I decided to simply head there.  It took a few minutes for me to get there but when I did, I saw that the place was empty.  Either Stacey never made it, or something had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to worry about Stacey; only to stop when I heard glass breaking nearby.  It didn\u2019t take much for me to realize that I was in danger.  I quickly decided it was best to leave the building; hoping it was safer outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I made my way to the nearest exit, occasionally hiding to avoid people, I started to think about Corinne.  She was probably just as confused, and scared, as I was.  There wasn\u2019t much I could do to help her now; I had to get myself to safety before worrying about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was finally outside the building, I hid behind a dumpster while I thought about my next move.  I thought about going to my house but I lived on the other side of town.  It was then I saw Allison\u2019s student ID in her purse; with her contact information on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lived in a neighborhood about 10 minutes from school.  It would still be dangerious getting there, but I figured it was closer.  With a destination in mind, I started to make my way to Allison's house.</span></div></div>",

As I walked through the streets, I saw all sorts of chaos; cars on fire, buildings with broken windows and people in various states of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked through it all, I realized that I was in more danger then I\u2019d initially thought \u2013 I was in the body of an attractive young girl.  Even before all of this, I wasn\u2019t good in a fight; what would stop anyone from trying to harm me now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully I made it to Allison\u2019s neighborhood without a problem; the area was in much the same condition as everywhere else.  I was walking up the street to Allison\u2019s house when I heard screaming and explosions in the distance.  I quickly decided to run the rest of the way, no easy feat in the boots I was currently wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I got to Allison\u2019s house, I dug through her purse to find her keys.  Once I was inside, I made to close and lock the door.  With that done, I collapsed against the door and slid down to the floor; crying as the weight of everything finally got to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stayed like that for almost 20 minutes before I got control of myself.  After wiping the tears from my eyes, I stood up and walked further into the house.  I was surprised by how nice it was; until I remembered her parents were really successful.  They allowed Allison to have parties when they weren\u2019t around; I\u2019d never been invited because I wasn\u2019t a part of the popular crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the living room, I saw a 70-inch TV attached to the far wall.  Ignoring that for a moment,  found myself looking at some of the photos on the wall.  They were of Allison at various ages; many of them from family vacations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing some of the places she had been to on vacation, I found myself getting jealous.  Allison was a spoiled brat and everyone at school knew it; here she was living the kind of life I wanted but she was taking it for granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking from the family room to the kitchen, I grabbed a water bottle from the fridge to quench my thirst.  I then explored the house some more; eventually coming to Allison\u2019s room.  Looking around, I figured this was where her parents spent most of their money; she had a big screen TV on her wall and a closet full of expensive clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I started to feel really tired; no doubt from the stressfull experience I\u2019d had today.  Walking over to the bed, I took off the boots and laid back.  The bed was so comfortable that I was asleep within minutes.</span></div></div>",

Getting out of bed, I looked at the clock on Allison\u2019s nightstand and saw that it was only 2:30; I\u2019d slept for about 45 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the window, I looked out and saw smoke in the distance.  Seeing the devastation outside, I once again started to worry about Corinne.  Retrieving Allison\u2019s phone, I tried to make a call but found the service was still out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing frustrated, I dropped the phone on the floor and walked out of the room.  I soon found myself down in the kitchen, feeling rather hungry.  Searching through the fridge, I found a Tupperware container full of pasta.  After microwaving a bowl, I grabbed a can of soda and went back upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the bed, to no one in particular, I said, \u201cMight as well turn on the TV, see if they\u2019re talking about what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went through about a dozen channels until I found one that was on the air.  It was the local news station.  The news anchor, normally an African American man his 30s, was replaced with a pregnant woman in her 20s.  \u201cAuthorities are calling this event the Great Shift; following news that as many as 95% of the world\u2019s population has suddenly swapped bodies.\u201d Pausing, the woman said, \u201cAs you can see, I\u2019ve been affected as well; having swapped with a pregnant barista at the local coffee shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to wonder what could have caused something like this; after a while, I started to worry if it was reversible.  Taking a sip of soda, I turned my attention back to the news.  \u201cThe local government has put a curfew in effect indefinitely.  Authorities ask that if you\u2019re...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anchor suddenly stopped speaking; as a pained expression appeared on his face.  I watched as he looked down at something behind the desk; his face going pale.  Trying to regain composure, the anchor said, \u201cI-I apologize for the interruption, folks; i-it seems that my water just broke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spit out a chunk of pasta when I heard that; the former man had just gone into labor.  I caught a glimpse of people scrambling behind him; only for the signal to cut out soon after.  Staring at the static on the TV for a moment, I eventually turned it off; wondering if the anchor was going to be alright.</span></div></div>",

I eventually found a recent edition of National Geographic; with nothing else to read, I grabbed that and sat on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading the magazine for a while, I put it down and walked into the kitchen to get something to drink.  Walking back to the family room with a can of soda, I found myself looking at some of the family photos on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more I looked at them, the angrier I got.  All I could think of was how spoiled Allison was and how she had no idea how good she had it.  Her parents gave her everything she\u2019d ever wanted, and in turn, she acted like she was the Queen of 10th grade.  I couldn\u2019t tell you how many times she would make fun of those of us she thought were losers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking at photos of Allison living it up on expensive vacations, I\u2019d had enough.  As I walked back to the couch, a surprising thought came into my head.  <i>What if I took Allison\u2019s place?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized the absurdity of the idea; I didn\u2019t have a clue how to act like her.  Then it hit me, all I had to do was learn enough to fool her friends and family.  Over time I could make changes, passing it off as trying to improve myself.  <i>Could I really take Allison\u2019s place?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this whole crazy idea hinged on whether or not Allison came back into the picture.  Not only that; but I\u2019d have to be a girl for the rest of my life and I could never reveal the truth to anyone.  That last bit gave me pause for a moment; sure my life sucked, but I did love my mom and sister.  <i>If I do this, I\u2019m never going to see them again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat on the couch, I thought about all the positive parts of this idea \u2013 I\u2019d be a member of the popular group at school and I\u2019d have parents who\u2019d spoil me.

It was the same thing with the photos on her phone; typical of a teenage girl, they were mostly selfies of her and her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked into the bathroom, I found myself wondering if I should be exactly like Allison.

Even after deciding to take over Allison\u2019s life, I could not help but worry about Corinne and my mom.  There had to be a way, without revealing that I was really Eric, to reach out to them.  Again, none of that mattered if they were dead or somewhere far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if I did not have enough on my plate worrying about my former family, I could not find a comfortable position on Allison\u2019s bed.  It was not that the mattress was uncomfortable; it was a very comfortable memory foam mattress.  It was my new breasts \u2013 I could not, for the life of me, find a comfortable way to sleep without them getting in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tossing and turning for the last 45 minutes, I finally gave in and sat up in bed.  Looking down at my chest, I said, \u201cHow can anyone sleep with these things on their chest?  They\u2019re like giant balloons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting an idea, I got out of bed and walked over to the dresser.  While she hadn\u2019t developed early like Allison, Corinne\u2019s breasts were almost as big as mine were.  I remembered her complaining about them getting in the way when running; until she had gotten a sports bra.  Digging through the dresser until I found one, I figured it would help my situation as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the bra in my hand, I walked over to the mirror; seeing myself still wearing the cheerleading outfit.  I had been hesitant to change out of the uniform; only because, at the time, I had not been ready to see Allison\u2019s body naked.  Correction \u2013 I had not been ready to see <i>my</i> body naked.  I had to get used to thinking of the girl\u2019s body as being mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting over my initial hesitation, I sucked it up and took my top off; giving myself my first unobstructed view of a girl\u2019s chest. <br>\r\n<i>Of all the ways I imagined this happening, I never imagined the first breasts I saw would be mine. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few moments but I managed to get the old bra off and replace it with the sports bra.  After jumping up and down to ensure they didn\u2019t bounce too much, I smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s much better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore going back to bed, I decided to strip out of the cheerleader skirt as well.  Once I was down to only my bra and undies, I climbed back into bed.  As I lay down, trying to block out the noises from outside, I once again started thinking about my family.  <i>Looks like I will not be getting any sleep tonight.</i></span></div></div>",

Sitting up in the bed, seeing the sun poking through the window, I realized it was pointless to go back to sleep.  Getting out of bed, I walked over to the window to look outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I could see smoke and fires in the distance, it seemed that Allison\u2019s neighborhood was relatively untouched; except for a few crashed cars further up the street.  Closing the curtains, I walked back over and sat on the edge of the bed.  Reaching for the remote, I turned the TV on and decided to see if there was any more news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the only working channel was the local one from yesterday.  I watched as a banner reading <b>MANDATORY CURFEW IN EFFECT</b> scrolled across the bottom of the screen.  It wasn\u2019t long before someone appeared on screen; a young boy probably around my age.  \u201cIf you\u2019re just joining us, my name is Rachel Simmons.\u201d  Pausing, Rachel said, \u201cA brief update on events that occurred yesterday; I am happy to report that Kyle Hemsworth gave birth to a healthy baby girl just before midnight last night.  Both the baby and mother are fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the bed, I found myself thinking about how much things had changed since yesterday; Rachel Simmons had been an attractive meteorologist who I had had a crush on.  On top of that Kyle Hemsworth, who'd been on the verge of being a professional basketball player before getting injured, was now a mother.  \u201cSeems like everyone\u2019s going to be dealing with changes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning my attention back to the TV, I watched as Rachel said, \u201cThe mayor has instituted a mandatory curfew, effective as of 5 AM this morning, until such time as conditions improve.  If you\u2019re in a secure location, it\u2019s advised that you stay there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that announcement, I turned off the TV.  As I sat on the bed, I realized it would probably be a good idea to make sure the house was secure.  I wasn\u2019t ready to spend time picking out an outfit, so I quickly put the cheerleader uniform back on.  After taking my hair out of the bun, I headed downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d just finished making secure the kitchen and garage were secure, and was making sure the windows were all locked when I heard frantic knocking coming from the front door.  Fearing that it was looters trying to break in, I searched for something to defend myself with.  After settling on a fireplace poker, I made my way to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I got to the door, I heard a voice call out, \u201cAlly, are you there?  It\u2019s Kelly and Erica!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInching towards the door, I was about to look out the window when I heard what sounded like someone putting a key in the door.  While Erica and Kelly were Allison\u2019s best friends, I had no way of knowing if it was really them out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened before I could find a place to hide; I found myself looking at _____.</span></div></div>",

The news said there was a curfew in effect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were hiding out at school until things died down.\u201d Pausing, Kelly said, \u201cOnce we thought it was safe, we snuck out and came here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to you yesterday?\u201d looking at me, Megan said, \u201cThe last time we saw you; you were heading to the locker room for gym class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew I had to come up with a convincing story to tell them. After a moment, I said, \u201cI\u2019d just gotten to the gym when everything went crazy.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI like panicked and before I knew it, I was standing in my driveway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you heard from your folks yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dawned on me that I had not thought about Allison\u2019s parents since this all started. My plan to take over Allison\u2019s life was fine; but not if I ended up as an orphan. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything yet, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll call when they can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re totally fine.\u201d Looking at me, Megan said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard anything from our parents either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re all fine.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cThey\u2019ll contact us when they can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards the kitchen, Erica said, \u201cDo you have anything to eat? Neither of us has had anything since yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had some leftover pasta for dinner last night, there should still be some left.\u201d </span></div></div>",

We were making our way through the hall towards the nearest stairwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were almost there when I heard a noise coming from a nearby bathroom.  Turning to the group, I said, \u201cKeep going to the <br>\r\nlibrary, I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s a good idea to separate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure who said that until Sophia Richardson, a pregnant Junior, stepped forward.

As I headed towards the noise, I started to wonder what came over me just now.  Before all this, I wasn\u2019t the kind of person to take charge.  Maybe it\u2019s just adrenaline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was closer to the noise, I realized it was coming from the girl\u2019s room.  I hesitated outside the door for a brief moment; until I realized I was in a girl\u2019s body now.  Pushing the door open, I realized the sound I\u2019d heard was someone crying.  I followed the sound to the stall on the far end and opened the door to find  Allison Rogers cowering in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison Rogers was another girl in my class; like Stacey, she was a member of the cheer squad.  Kneeling down, I said, \u201cAllison, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing my hand away, she said, \u201cGet away from me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAllison it's me, Evan Stone.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEv-Everyone\u2019s gone crazy!\u201d looking at me, she said, \u201cI-I don\u2019t know what's going on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison was known to be quite mean to those she considered unpopular; I was no exception.  But that didn\u2019t mean I wanted her to be in danger.  \u201cAllison, get up; we have to get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison finally came around and grabbed my hand.  I was about to help her up when I suddenly felt the ground start to shake.  <br>\r\nWondering what was happening, I leaned against the wall for support when I suddenly blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure how long I\u2019d been unconsciousness; but when I woke up, I realized I was ______.</span></div></div>",

I was sitting on the bathroom floor and still wearing the cheerleader uniform.  As I went to stand up, a strand of dark brown hair fell in front of my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was my first clue something was different \u2013 Stacey had blonde hair.  Getting up from the stall floor, I walked over to the mirror and saw Allison\u2019s face looking back at me.  <i>Why did I switch bodies again?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, I was about to ask Allison if she was okay; stopping when I realized that Stacey\u2019s body was no longer in the bathroom.  It was probably better that way; she was in hysterics and was not being very helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the need to call Stacey, I searched for her phone only to find it shattered on the floor.  It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out Allison had broken it when she ran off.  Getting an idea, I retrieved Allison\u2019s purse from the stall and dug through it until I found her phone.  I immediately tried to dial Stacey only to find there was no longer any service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not that far from the library; I should probably just head there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the bathroom, I headed off towards the stairwell.  Once I was on the first floor, I realized just how bad things had gotten.  There were desks and chairs strewn all over the hall; there was even the burning hulk of a car smashed into the main entrance.  <i>How long was I unconscious?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting a clock on the wall, I noticed it said 1:15 \u2013 meaning I had been lying unconscious in the bathroom for the last 2 hours.  I heard what sounded like glass breaking nearby and quickly realized the school was no longer safe.  Desperate to stay safe, I decided to leave the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was finally outside the building, I hid behind a dumpster while I thought about my next move.  I thought about going to my house but I lived on the other side of town. It was then I saw Allison\u2019s student ID in her purse; with her contact information on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lived in a neighborhood about 10 minutes from school.  It would still be dangerous getting there, but I figured it was closer.  With several choices to choose from, I decided to go to _____.</span></div></div>",

There were burning buildings and cars, and people in various states of panic.  Sadly I also encountered a few dead bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurred to me, as I was walking, that maybe staying at the school was a safer idea.

That was consistent with the world population. Scientists are still researching why the Great Shift happened, and trying to piece together a pattern to explain how people swapped. Generally, the odds were higher to swap with people closer to each other than those far away. But that's all we know at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie let go of my hand as we got to the bottom of the stairwell. I waddled after the group slowly in Sophia's heavily pregnant body, feeling a lot more vulnerable than when I was Stacey Everett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, the corridor was eerily quiet. This was part of the old area of the school building. Only the library and bookstore were still regularly used, as the other classrooms were vacant due to a smaller student population size than in years' past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully nobody gave the six of us any trouble. Any students down here kept quiet, hiding in an empty classroom or cowering inside a storage closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what's it like? Being Sophia, I mean.\" Connie asked me quietly as we walked down a hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh, I feel all bloated and tired,\" I complained, rubbing my new belly. Sophia was dressed in a loose-fitting, flowery maternity dress, sweatpants, and flip flops. It felt like I was wearing a tablecloth, draped over the huge weights ballooning out from her chest and stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could feel Sophia's bra straps digging in to my shoulders; her hair swishing against my upper back, neck, and shoulders; and the occasional kick coming from the unborn child inside her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the same height as Stacey but much less athletic. Everyone else in the group towered over me. My feet ached, and my lower back felt like it was on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By my guess, it looks like she's in her third trimester,\" Connie rubbed her chin, reveling in the sandpaper-like feel of her unshaved face against her hand. She secretly loved being a guy, or at least not being paralysed anymore. She continued, \"I mean, I didn't really know her that well but she started to show about four or five months ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm carrying another life inside of me,\" I squeaked with Sophia's tiny voice. Then I coughed. \"But I sound like a total airhead now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie giggled in the boy's deep voice. \"No offense, but Sophia never struck me as the sharpest tool in the shed. But I do feel kind of bad for her... ever since she got dumped by her boyfriend after he found out she was pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophia seemed like a nice girl, but she was also a bit slow and naive. Even though she was a junior, she had been held back a year after spending too much time chasing boys and ignoring her studies. Getting pregnant was the cherry on top of a series of poor life decisions, decisions for which I was now paying the price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks,\" I muttered. \"I hope we all can get back to normal soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Nodded Connie, although she wouldn't mind being a boy and getting to try out the strange new penis between her legs. As she thought about it, she felt a definite stirring down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omigosh!\" She yelped, covering her crotch with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Connie?\" I stopped while the others continued down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look! Um... this is... it's like it has a mind of its own!\" She revealed the hardening tent in her trousers. \"I was just thinking of what this body might look like naked and then... you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to manhood, I guess,\" I rolled my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you get rid of it???\" Connie stammered helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI folded my arms. \"Well, not thinking about it would be a good first step.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried pushing down her erection, a voice crackled from the loudspeakers. I couldn't tell whose voice it was, but it sounded like an old lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, everyone please stop and listen to this important announcement. This is Principal Daniel Shepard. For reasons we do not yet understand, most students and teachers in school have traded places with each other. We need everyone, whether you were affected or not, to report to the auditorium immediately. Be prepared to verify your identity, where you will be issued a temporary ID card which you will use until we can figure out a longer-term solution. If you are injured or need medical attention, please report to the nurse's office or to room B304, where we have set up a temporary first-aid station. Thank you. Stay safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie and I stared at each other in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least somebody has a plan for what the hell we're supposed to be doing,\" She murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to the others?\" I asked, glancing around at the empty hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, stay here and let me find them.\" Connie suggested, but I grabbed on to her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please don't leave me here alone like this. It's bad enough we're basically unsupervised down here. Who knows who could be inside any of these students?\" Thoughts of criminals and murderers flitted through my brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'll only be gone for a second.\" She tried to reassure me. I didn't like her idea, but she seemed much more confident than me at the moment and what else was I going to do? If she wanted, she could just outrun me now anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I let her go and waited for her in a nearby classroom. Thankfully, it was empty. I sat my big butt in a chair and leaned back, feeling Sophia's baby press against my stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I just sat there, looking down at the shapely female body I now wore, trying to resist the urge to start groping my new breasts. Just then Stacey jumped down off the desk and walked over to me, while the other students in class chatted amongst themselves. \"Evan, you can go scope out see how widespread this is.\" she told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't compute in my mind. I just frowned at her and shook my head, remembering Tony's reaction to this whole swapping thing. \"Er... that's a stupid idea, what if I'm attacked like Edwin was?\" I responded. \"Not as though I could defend myself very well now that I'm a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls aren't complete wimps you know.\" Stacey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just sighed at her. \"It would be better if you or Edwin went to take a look. Or even Tony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony overheard that one. \"I'm not going nowhere with this little shit in my body.\" he grumbled audibly, gesturing to his former body, now occupied by a confused... and bruised Edwin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Stacey grumbled, rolling her eyes and making my body look very effeminate as she stood with hands on hips. \"Edwin... can you go? And you can go bathe those cuts and bruises in the toilets while you're at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not going anywhere either.\" Tony snapped at Stacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I reached into the leather bag at my feet, pulling out Stacey's pink phone. I held it in one of my now manicured hands for a moment and then offered it to her. \"Why not just phone the police and ask them if this has happened everywhere else?\" I suggested. \"Or... phone your family and ask them the same thing.\" I added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew I was making sense, and in the end decided to....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll give her a call and maybe we can find out just how widespread this is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" I said as i handed Stacey her phone. She then went off into a corner of the room to talk with her cousin. Meanwhile, I proceeded to examine all the changes that had just occurred to me. For starters, my hair was now blonde and longer and pulled tightly into a ponytail. There was a light amount of makeup on my face now, and from past memories thats all Stacey ever needed to look good. I was now wearing the schools cheerleading uniform. My arms and legs were now smaller, but muscular for a girls. On my feet, a pair of all white cheerleading shoes. Not wanting to go any further, I looked at Stacey to see that she was finishing her call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, I stood up, walked over to Stacey and asked \"whats the news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my cousin didnt change bodies\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. She said that while most all the cops changed bodies, they've all checked in and are on the streets trying to keep the peace. She also said that theres a lot of reports of rioting going on, especially in the school\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey proceeded to tell the rest of the class what she had just told me. \"Evan, would you mind poking your head out and seeing if we can go out the nearby doors\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem\" i answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, I opened the door and took two steps out. When I looked toward the nearest doors outside, my heart sank. In front of the doors, they were blocked by a ton of students. All of whom were fighting with one another. Returning to the room, I said \"the doors are blocked by a riot. Theres no way we're going to get out that way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the gym\" Tony said. \"Theres virtually no class rooms near by and like three or four exits\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats a good idea Tony\" Stacey said. \"Ok, everyone grab all your things and lets head to the gym\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone hesitantly grabbed their bags. What was really funny was the girls who'd become guys, because they were carrying their girly backpacks and purces. I almost laughed, but then I saw Stacey pick up her things with my old body and that feeling quickly changed. Not wanting to be left behind, I quickly grabbed picked up my bag and followed the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we got closer to the gym, Stacey grabbed my arm and pulled me aside. \"Listen, Evan. I've been keeping my eyes on you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I wanted to make sure you werent doing anything, inappropriate, with my body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And\" she started, but paused for a second and opened a locker. \"And I've noticed that your not necessarily comfortable right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\" I asked. Its not like I've got a choice right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I keep a change of clothes in my locker\" she said as she pulled out a duffel bag. \"I figured you'd find these better than my cheer uniform\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" I said taking the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want any help\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I should be fine\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll be waiting just outside\" Stacey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I slowly walked toward the locker rooms. Hesitantly, I made my way toward the girls locker room ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn.hotfrog.com.au/companies/Cheerleading-Gear/images-pr/Cheerleading-Hire-Uniforms-147046_image.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn.hotfrog.com.au/companies/Chee...</a> ). Once inside, I took the cheer shoes off and set them and the bags on a bench. I then proceeded to attempt to get out of the cheer uniform. Looking in a mirror, I found a zipper on the back of the uniform. After five or six attempts, I still had come no closer to getting the zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoking my head out the door, I said \"I, um. I could use some help\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on her face, Stacey replied \"how could i have guessed that\" as she walked in the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Stacey's help, I quickly got out of the cheer uniform and was standing there in nothing but her sports bra and spandex underwear. She then pulled out a pair of khaki pants and handed them to me. I quickly put them on, nothing how tight they were. She then handed me a dark blue shirt. Again, I quickly put it on. Lastly, she handed me a pair of ballet flats. I couldn't of the top of my head describe the pattern on them, but it was something I'd seen on girls at school before ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://ak1.polyvoreimg.com/cgi/img-set/cid/44112671/id/BtTY2FDVRTu7QCaF-LmMFg/size/y.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://ak1.polyvoreimg.com/cgi/img-set/c...</a> ).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, lets get going\" Stacey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, where to?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my house is on the edge of town\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my house is a few blockes away\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then Evan, to your house it is\"</span></div></div>",

Once we were there I turned to Stacey and said \"I think my mom is still here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" I started. \"Her car is still there. And we keep all are keys in a bowl next to the door. If someone wanted to take our car and run it wouldn't be that hard\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if there's someone in there that's to shocked to leave\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about it for a second. \"True\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that we made our way up the steps to the front door. Slowly, I turned the doorknob and found it unlocked. I gave Stacey a reassuring look as I slowly opened the door. Poking my head in, I called out \"MOM?! ARE YOU THERE?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked through the doorway, I saw my mom walk into the living room from the kitchen. \"Evan, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I'm not mom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrine?\" I asked, shocked that my sister was now in my moms body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, who's your friend there?\" She asked, gesturing to Stacey who'd followed me into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Stacey, I said \"this is Stacey. She's a cheerleader in my grade. I told her that she could stay here until it's safe for her to head home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ok. I was about to see if there's anything new on the new about this if you two wanna join me\" Corrine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That actually sounds like a good idea\" Stacey said. \"What have they been saying about this so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much actually. They've been calling this whole thing \"The Great Shift\". They are hypothesizing that about 90 to 95%  of the worlds population has swapped bodies with each other. And it hasn't been just swaps between two people\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\" Stacey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they said that just because your in someone's body doesn't mean there in yours\" Corrine said as she turned the tv on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, they were showing local news. They weren't really giving us any helpful information. They were showing riots in the city and huge car wrecks. All they were telling us places to avoid at all costs. We kept watching for about 20 more minutes, before I heard my stomach start making noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you two don't mind\" I said standing up. \"I am going to go find something to eat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Evan\" Corrine said. \"Could you just make some lunch for everyone. I mean, it is kinda that time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" I said. \"You two good with turkey ham and cheese?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me\" Corrine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good with that\" Stacey answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take that long for me to whip up some sandwiches for everyone. While we ate, we scanned through all the tv stations to find something that was on. Stacey and Corrine ended up finding some show that I really couldn't have cared any less about. As I was finishing my sandwich, there was a knock at the door. Looking at me, Corrine asked \"who could that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, maybe?\" I said, unsure myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you going to leave that person just waiting there?\" Stacey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get it\" Corrine said. \"Chances are whoever it is will recognize moms body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Corrine made her way to the door, I also followed close by. Slowly, she opened the door. Standing there on the front porch was a woman who looked to be somewhere between 25 and 30 years old. And from the looks of it, she was somewhere between 4 and 5 months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" Corrine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda. Listen, I know this might be hard to believe, but it's me. Kyle\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Linda\" Corrine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?\" I asked as I stepped out from behind Corrine. \"It's me, Evan\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan?\" He asked looking at me with a very surprised look on his face. \"And Corrine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dad\" Corrine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god. So this didn't just happen to me. Have either of you talked with your mother yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Corrine said as she turned around and left both us and the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was all that about?\" Dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" I started. \"You did leave us when she needed you the most\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I deserved that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both stood there in silence for a bit, before I said \"come on inside. Can't leave you out here on your own\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brought my dad into the living room, locked the front door,  and let him sit on the couch while I took a seat in a recliner. Stacey had gone off to find out what was wrong with Corrine, though I think I know what it was. \"So dad\" I started. \"Why did you come here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" he started, before he was interrupted by a knock at the door. Getting up as quick as I could while keeping my new breasts under control, I made my way to the door and unlocked it. Opening it a crack, I peaked out and saw Corrine's body standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" I asked, hoping it would be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Evan it's me\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, mom I was so worried about you\" I said. \"Quick, let's get inside. It's been pretty crazy outside lately\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it\" she said as we walked towards the living  room. \"Hey, this might sound weird but you haven't heard from your father today, have you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, mom. He got here just before you did\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" she said, almost surprised. Looking over at my dad, she said \"Hi Kyle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Linda\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where's Corrine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, mom, she ran somewhere upstairs. She seemed pretty upset that dad came here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll go have a talk with her\" mom said as she made her way upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I got back to talking to my dad. \"So, dad, why'd you come here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Evan. I was coming to talk with your mother\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd been thinking the last few weeks. About how I abandoned you guys and all that. And the more I thought about it, the more I felt sickened. So, I called your mother yesterday and asked her if we could talk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk about what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About coming back into your guys lives\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Evan. I'm not talking about joint custody. I'm not even talking about you and your sister spending any nights with me. God knows I don't deserve that. I'm just talking about being around on the holidays. Maybe taking you two to a baseball game. Be there as another person to talk to if you for whatever reason wanted to. I mean your a few years from leaving for college and your sister isn't that far behind. I just wanted a chance to do something right by you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can understand that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I talked with your mother over the phone about it for a while yesterday and she said if I was serious about it to come here today and talk it over with her in person. I was just leaving my apartment building when this happened and I was a few blocks away. But I got lost and being lost and pregnant is a very slow trip\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" I asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The 5 of us spent most of the rest of the day either watching the news or trying to adjust to the change. I had spent a good amount of time talking with my dad, learning what he had been doing since he left us and whatnot. But eventually it started getting dark out and everyone decided to go to bed. Mom let dad use her bed because he was pregnant now while she slept on the pull out bed in the couch. Corrine and I slept in our own rooms, and mom gave Stacey the guest room even though she insisted mom take it (which mom wouldn't allow, giving Stacey was technically a guest right now).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up the next morning, and instantly realized today was going to be vastly different than any other before. Just opening my eyes felt different, from the longer eyelashes to having my new long blonde hair covering my face. As I rolled out of bed and trudged to the bathroom, I felt the full extent of the differences between my old body and Stacey's body, which I was now in. From the breasts that jiggled uncontrolled underneath my old bra-less t-shirt, to the uncontrollable sway in my hips as they shifted from side to side with each step I took. As I walked into the bathroom and looked at the mirror, I couldn't help but chuckle a little. The reflection looking back at me was something I'd never before seen (thought I'll probably see it a lot more often now) from Stacey. The lack of makeup and major case of bed head made her almost look like a train wreck. However, Stacey was one of those girls who barely needed any makeup to look beautiful, but it was clear that her hair might have been another story. I was about to do something about it when I got a sudden, very recognizable, feeling. I had to pee. Walking over to the toilet, I pulled down the sweatpants I wore to bed last night and took a seat. It felt weird, just having the urine dribble out instead of the stream I was used to. Once I was done, and pulled my pants and underwear back up, I walked up to the sink and brushed my teeth. Then I walked out of the bathroom and downstairs, not even thinking about my hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked into the kitchen to get some breakfast, Corrine said \"Nice hairdo bro. Whatcha going for? Bride of Frankenstein\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrine\" mom said. \"It's his first morning as a girl and he's never had to worry about his hair. Give him a break\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\"'Corrine said as she let out a deep sigh. It was so weird, basically seeing mom and Corrine act like each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I ate my breakfast, mom and Corrine left to go do whatever it was they were going to do, and Stacey joined me for some breakfast. The two of us talked a little bit about what we should do in terms of her going home or not. Apparently she had called her home and nobody answered, so I suggested she just stay here. No point in staying in an empty house. Stacey agreed with me, and offered to help me find some clothes that would fit me since nobody wants to wear the same thing every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe started in Corrine's room, where Stacey discovered that the bras and panties  were almost the same size as I needed. \"Well\" she said as she handed me a pair. \"These are almost the same size as you are now.\" I looked at what she handed me, a plane black bra, but the black panties had some words on the butt. I shot Stacey a dirty look and showed them to her. \"What?\" She asked. \"It's not like anyone's gonna see them, and they aren't even the worst\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything that doesn't make someone read my butt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you won't want to wear those. Not yet anyway\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" I said as I took off the shirt I wore last night and put the bra on. I didn't need Stacey's help this time, but it did take a few minutes. Then I slid out of the sweats and underwear I had been wearing and put the clean ones Stacey had handed me on. I stood there feeling exposed as I stood in front of my old body in nothing but some bras and panties, while my old body looked through my younger sisters clothes to find something that would hopefully fit me. \"You should consider yourself pretty lucky\" Stacey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems your sister wears mostly the same size as me even though she's a little shorter than me. It means you won't have to go clothes shopping or anything else like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that is a good thing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stacey continued looking through Corrine's clothes, she added \"Don't worry. I'll stop by some day with some of my old clothes so you have some stuff that fits properly and you don't have to share with your mom\". After a little bit more looking Stacey pulled out a pair of Corrine's white skinny jeans and a black t-shirt. I thanked her for the helped she handled them to me and she went downstairs while I got dressed. I started with the easy stuff first as I put the shirt on, followed by one of my grey sweatshirts Corrine had \"borrowed\" from me. Then I began the process of getting the jeans on. It took more effort and wiggling than I was used to, but I got them on and couldn't help but catch a glance at my new but in Corrine's full length mirror. It caused me to smile a little, knowing that I now had a butt I had stared at plenty while in school ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://varunjainblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/girl-maggcom.gif?w=1200\" target=\"_blank\">https://varunjainblog.files.wordpress.co...</a> ). Then a thought hit me. If I had stared at this butt so much when I was a guy, that means that guys will be staring at my butt now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked into the living room, where everyone was already dressed and watching the news for any new news concerning the shift, I took stock of how everyone was dressed from how that person would have dressed prior to the shift. Mom for example had dressed Corrine's body much more, maturely, choosing to wear looser fitting clothes that don't show off her body the way Corrine would always dress. Dad was dressed in some of mom's old maternity dresses, while Stacey had chosen a pair of jeans and a black polo shirt (not something I'd have worn around the house, but she always dressed a really nice). As for Corrine in mom's body, she had dressed much more trendy, wearing a pair of very short black shorts and a tight top that showed a bunch of cleavage. Taking a seat next to mom, I leaned over and whispered to her \"I never knew you owned shorts that short\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't\" she whispered back. \"Your sister got some scissors and made them shorter before I could object\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh\" I replied, a little louder than I had anticipated which enabled Corrine to hear me. I knew she heard because of the dirty look she shot me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five of us continued to watch the news for about a hour, all the while I kept looking outside at the nice weather with the feeling that I'd rather be outside than in. When it was clear there was still no new updates on what caused this, I headed out to our porch and took a seat on our porch swing. I sat out there alone for a few minutes until Stacey came outside and sat next to me. \"Mind if I join you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us just sat silently for a minute, slowly rocking back and forth on the swing, until Stacey said \"I used to always love being outside. I'd grab a book, find a perfect spot in our back yard, and just read for hours. Heck, I could just sit outside listening to the birds, doing nothing else, and just feel peaceful\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us sat outside for a little while longer, until we noticed some darker storm clouds coming. I hadn't realized it, but as I sat there I found myself sitting with my knees tucked to my chest and had slowly inched closer to Stacey until my head was nearly resting on my old shoulder. It wasn't until we heard a loud boom from the nearby storm that broke us from the subconscious trance we both found ourselves in, and headed back inside to rejoin the others.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Stacey and I rejoined my family, I heard a buzzing sound coming from Stacey's pocket. Pausing for a second, she pulled her cellphone out and looked at it. \"Oh my gosh, it's my dad calling. I gotta take this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't feel like you have to explain it to me. Go find out if they're safe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for understanding\" she replied as she answered the call and walked to the kitchen. I meanwhile, entered the living room where my mom was just turning on Netflix. Apparently, with everything that happened over the last 36 hours or so we had lost the signal for a majority of our non-news tv channels. Mom had selected one of the hospital dramas that she and Corrine enjoyed watching. I, however, could have cared less about what we watched. I was more worried about Stacey and how her parents were. It was weird, I'm worried about two people I've never met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten or fifteen minutes, Stacey entered the living room and took a seat in an empty chair. \"How are your parents?\" I asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they're together right now\" she said. \"Although they're in a hospital for a couple days\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they ok?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. They're fine. My mom ended up in my dads body and my dad in in the body of a twenty five-ish year old girl who was recovering from a recent surgery\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they're both ok?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Stacey answered. \"According to the hospital they should let my dad go in a couple of days or so. My mom's gonna stay with him until they release him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, feel free to stay here with us until that happens. It's a pleasure to have you here with us\" mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mrs. Jefferson\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ended up watching about an episode and a half before I got bored with the show and decided to go upstairs to my room and play on my Xbox for a bit. I was doing good, and after a while a couple of my friends joined on with me. I was doing good, with plenty more kills than deaths. But something felt wrong the whole time. Looking outside, i couldn't shake this nagging feeling that I wanted to get out of the house. It was almost like what Stacey had told me earlier, about how she loved to spend time outside. It was as if I had some part of Stacey's subconscious that had now joined my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, I started getting hungry and decided to tear myself away from my game and head to the kitchen, where I was greeted by Corrine making sandwiches. She must have heard me because no sooner had I walked in the kitchen she turned her head and asked \"You want a sandwich Evan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" I replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, Corrine grabbed two sandwiches off a stack, put them on a plate and handed them to me. As I accepted the food and took a seat, Corrine asked \"hey Evan. Have you noticed yourself acting, different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, are you noticing that your not acting like yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought for a moment before telling her \"you know, I have noticed that I get these subconscious feeling every now and again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, earlier Stacey was telling me about how she liked spending time outside, and I keep getting this feeling that I want to spend as much of my free time outside\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I almost have the same feeling. Except I keep getting the urge to have a cigarette or take care of everyone. Heck, I've even started feeling uncomfortable wearing what I put on this morning\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of us continued talking, slowly everyone began entering the kitchen one by one as they were getting hungry. They would join the conversation for a bit, before heading off to continue whatever it was they had been doing. From what we could gather Mom, Dad, and Stacey all were noticing the same thing where they were getting subconscious feelings that they know weren't their own. It would be discovered years later that there were small amounts of a persons mind that stayed back with their old body, rather than travel with them. For now, we all just seemed to assume that this was our minds way to try and cope with a change as drastic as what we all went through.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's been a couple of days since I found myself in Stacey's body, and I hate to say it by I've started getting used to some of the different feelings. Heck, waking up every morning and seeing Stacey's pretty face looking back at me isn't even surprising anymore. And based on what I've seen from everyone, they've started to feel the same way. And I was starting to get the feeling that I wanted to go outside and do something. Anything really, I didn't care what at this point. I'd actually started getting bored playing on my Xbox. After I went downstairs for some breakfast, I saw Stacey who told me she was feeling the same way. That she also wanted to get out of the house and do something. \"Hey, I have an idea\" Stacey said in between spoonfuls of cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we go to my house for the day\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about it for a moment before asking \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for one it would be a change of scenery. There's plenty we could do. And we could take some of my clothes back here so you don't have to constantly share with you mom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that actually sounds like a good idea\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sounds like a good idea?\" Mom asked as she came downstairs to join us for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacey was just suggesting that since we were both feeling a little stir crazy, we head over to her house and spend some time there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was silent as she thought about it. All the negative possibilities of what could happen were certainly running through her mind. Eventually though she allowed us to go, with the condition we would be back by dinner. With that, Stacey and I quickly finished our breakfasts and ran upstairs. As I was about to head into Corrine's room to get some clean clothes, Stacey suggested I go over in the pajamas I was wearing now and change once I get there so there's less I would have to take back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Stacey had finished changing, the two of us went to the garage where we took my mom's SUV and began our drive to Stacey house. I let Stacey drive sense she knew where she lived and would get us there a lot quicker than if I drove. The two of us talked for the whole drive, changing from one topic to another. Eventually though, we arrived at Stacey's house. She lived outside of town in what seemed like the middle of nowhere. After turning off the road we drove down a very long dirt driveway. From the road, you couldn't even tell there was a house here if it wasn't for the break in the trees and mailbox. We then drove what seemed like a solid quarter mile before pulling up to the house. The house itself was a fairly good sized place, apparently 3 stories with a 2 car garage and a good sized pull barn not to far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Stacey parked and we exited the car, she lead me to the house. Using a key hidden by a fake rock, she unlocked the door and walked in with me close behind. Once inside, Stacey showed me to her room so I could change into her clothes. After she left me, I slowly took in all the sights before me. I was in the bedroom of one of the most popular girls in my school. As a whole, it wasn't that dissimilar to my own sisters room. Although there was definitely a country vibe going on. Moving on to the closet, I was similarly surprised with the clothes I found. For as long as I could remember Stacey was always a really nice dresser, often coming to school in whatever was popular for girls. But in her closet I found a large supply of camo and other clothes you'd expect from a person who'd spent their whole life living in the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking through everything, I settled on a rather simple black bra and pantie set, a pair of looser fitting blue jeans (that were still rather fitting around the hips and butt) that had a rip over the right knee, and a red short sleeve tee shirt with the local colleges logo on it. After getting dressed I slowly walked downstairs, taking in every sight this house had to offer. It took a minute, but I eventually found Stacey. She was outside, currently sitting on a low branch of a tree in the back yard (although she was still about 7 feet or so off the ground). I walked outside to join her, still barefoot. \"I never would have pegged you as a country girl\" I said as I neared the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Side effect of living out here I guess\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I started climbing up towards the branch she was sitting on I asked \"So, what was first? Country Stacey or girly Stacey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Stacey replied \"County. Definitely country Stacey\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sparked the change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey was silent for a moment as she recalled her past. I could see a tear forming as she said. \"My mom. My mom came back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom left you\" I asked. \"I never knew that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody does. You see, early in their senior year of college when my parents were still dating my dad accidentally got my mom pregnant. She freaked out, didn't want to have a baby. But my dad talked her into not getting an abortion. It kinda drove them apart a bit. But 9 months later, she gave birth. One hour later she had signed away all parental rights she had over me. My dad ended up moving in with his older sister for help raising me. Around when I was 2 my dad decided to move out here, which is where I became a country girl. Shortly after the start of 6th grade my mom had a change of heart and wanted to try and be apart of our lives again. She was doing well and felt bad about leaving, so she talked with my dad about coming back. He said he'd give her a chance, and she ended up staying this time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stayed as I processed what she told me. \"Are your parents still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Separated?\" She said finishing my sentence. \"No, they're together now. They started dating again freshman year and got married a year later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sat without saying a word for a minute, and I could tell talking about her past had brought up some feelings that Stacey had tried to keep buried. She wasn't crying, but tears had begun to form in her eyes. What happened next, neither of us had anticipated. Something came over me as I leaned over and kissed Stacey on the cheek. We were both startled by what I had done, and sat next to each other with saying a word for a few minutes. Eventually, Stacey spoke up and asked that I not tell anyone what she had told me. I, in turn, told her that it wasn't my story to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us spent most of the afternoon doing various chores, mostly cleaning the house because nobody living in the house for the last little bit has left it surprisingly dusty. Around noon or so we fired up Netflix and watched movies for a majority of the afternoon. Eventually though, we noticed that it was starting to get late and knew we needed to head back to my house soon so we ran up to Stacey's room and grabbed a bunch of her clothes and loaded them into the back of my mom's car. After the both of us had ran up and down the stairs several times we had moved about half of Stacey's clothes and felt that was good enough for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we drove back, we talked about how we thought things would be different once things started returning to somewhat normal. I told her that I think that it would be surprising how quickly people start returning to normal. That for the most part nerds will still be nerds, bullies will continue to bully, and so on. Stacey, meanwhile, thought that this will cause people to have more of an understanding about the problems that other people have and that humanity as a whole will be better off because of this. We ended up deciding that on this topic we would have to agree to disagree for now and see who ends up right in the long run. But this didn't keep us from chatting for the remainder of the drive back to my house. We ended up arriving shortly before my mom was pulling dinner out of the oven. She jokingly gave us a hard time about arriving so close to her dinner deadline, but didn't make it a huge problem of it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a couple of weeks, things began to normalize, well, somewhat normal that is. Stacy and I were in my room watching Netflix when my mom came racing up the stairs. She bursted in the room and said that due to people getting back to their homes and lives, school would be staring again. What scared my mom was that they said anybody in a child\u2019s body would be going to school and anybody in an adult body would be wherever they should be. Stacy was worried because she was  still not ready to get out in the public. When my mom left the room, I turned to Stacy reasurringly and told her,\u201cEverything\u2019s gonna be alright. If I can get used to being a girl, you\u2019ll be fine as a guy.\u201d<br>\r\n       Stacy looked at me thankfully for that reassurance. I felt that we had really connected these past few weeks while all this craziness was happening. It was nice to have someone other than my family who understood what I was going through. Someone who could be there with me. We talked for hours about what it might be like going back to school. Now she seemed almost excited. For all we know, our English teacher could be Illiterate.<br>\r\n       On the morning we were planned to return to school, Stacy drove my mom to the middle school and dropped her off, then we headed to the highschool. Ever since we first noticed that our personalities had those little subconscious feelings, they had developed further. I didn\u2019t even attempt to get in the driver\u2019s seat, I just automatically went to the passenger side. I even began to feel female emotions, and I noticed Stacy began acting like she had male emotions. I even began feeling attracted to my old body, which I was really grossed out by at first, until i realized that it really wasn\u2019t my body anymore. Certain mannerisms were also starting to show. For instance, we were walking towards the doors of the school when Stacy ran ahead of me to hold open the door. I thanked her and we headed to class. People definitely were acting weird. But everybody got used to the fact that this was life now. A week later everybody seemed adjusted and that was that. Posters began to cover the wall. The posters had big letters saying PROM. I guess they figured that they might as well get things back on track.<br>\r\n       About a week after the prom posters began showing up, I got asked to prom by Edwin in what was formerly Tony\u2019s body. I had a really tough time turning him down... I felt bad because I kinda knew what getting turned down was like as formerly being a guy on the somewhat nerdy side. A day later, I was walking out to the car when I noticed Stacy standing by the car holding up a big sign that said, \u201cI don\u2019t care that it\u2019s my old BODY, because your the only BODY I want to go to PROM with!\u201d. She was standing there holding that sign and a heart shaped box of chocolates. I was so surprised, happy and excited that I ran up to Stacy and kissed him. We got in the car she drove back to my house. She had moved in with us due to complications with her dad, and her mom wouldn\u2019t leave the hospital. My dad had left to go back to his apartment, so everybody had their own rooms. Stacy and I were just so happy about Prom that we immediately told everyone when we got home.<br>\r\n      Later that night, Stacy told me that I the cheerleading squad was starting up again for the first time since the Shift and she thought I should go out for it. I was actually excited. Cheerleading actually sounded fun to me.</span></div></div>",

I was listening to Mr. Tomlin explaining some equations and other stuff, but my head was in another part. i was still thinking in what my sister had said in the morning. Corinne could be a bitch sometimes, but she was right, it was really incredible that I have never had a girlfriend. I started thinking in Stacey, the perfect woman; but I already know that she would never pay attention to someone like me. I think that the main problem was that there were people like Tony Coletta, dumb asses that believe that were superior. He always bullied me and make me have some of the worst days in my life, but it seems that some of the prettier girls love guys like him. I look to the back of the classroom and saw full of anger that Jock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust at looking at him you can said that he was strong, of course he was in the football team, but he also practice kick-boxing  being the local champion; and that make that most of the school feared and respect him. I have to accept that he was good-looking but he maybe was fit but he was not intelligent. It was very easy to find him during the weekend drunk in a party doing stupid things or even worse, doing that same things in the middle of the classroom. I cannot understand how Stacey prefer someone like Tony, strong but with no intelligence, than me. Gladly he didn\u00b4t notice that I was looking him, because  if he notice that the most probable thing is that I would have an horrible visit to the toilets. But there he was just sending messages in his cellphone and as always not paying attention in his class. After that I look again to the teacher that was still explaining the same equation. And then it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a great force, I felt the ground trembling like in a earthquake but the wind in my face was so strong that I believe that I was in the middle of the tornado. Both strange sensation were felt almost a minute but the movements were so strong that the teacher fell to the ground as many of my classmates that tried to run. I only grab to my desk praying to god, because I really believe that it was the end of my life.  And then my heart start to hurt immensely. It wasn\u00b4t a common headache. I close my eyes and shout of dolor and before I passed awayI hear many of my friends and enemies, even the teacher screaming of pain. I understood that what was happening to me was also happening to me was happening to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment I didn\u00b4t know the time that I passed out, but when I opened my eyes the people was standing and trying to understand what just happened. I look to my friends and notice that i was near the door at the back of the room. I feel that I was taller and bigger. I put my hands in my face and really felt strange. My hair also felt strange, as I touch my face I start to realize that in some form I have change. Then I look at my clothes, they were not mine. I was wearing the football team jacket, and a a blue graphic t-shirt, in my left hand was a silver clock and over my desk was a black cellular, just as the one that Tony was using a minutes ago. I look to the place where I was sit and look to my still unconscious body. My shock was great if I was there then I wasn\u00b4t any more Evan. Many people start screaming realizing that they were in a different body. I tried to stayed calm in that incredible scene, as one of the boys start to speak in spanish and a girl start to cry because she has lost his mom, but I  paralyzed myself when I look at the window and saw the reflection of tony looking at me. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It feels so different and hard to believe. Then I see my older self finally awake looking at his hands, trying to understand what just happened to him. That was the first moment that I realized that Tony maybe was in my body, but strangely he never looked at me. But if he wasn\u00b4t Evan who he was. I stayed quite during a moment looking at my old self. I was decided to talk to him but I was scared of who was in my body, but just before I decided to go and speak to the stranger and message from the director was heard through all the high school, strangely the voice of the director was that of the cafeteria lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Students, I, your principal Thomas Proud, have to tell you the terrible misfortune that has appeared in the world. Almost two hours ago must of you feel an earthquake and strong wind, but that was only an illusion that your brain made. This illusion was created by an expansive energy released from a Laboratory in new york. I know that we are at the other side of the country but the effects of these energy is going to affect all the world. These Laboratory experimented and investigated the nature of our soul, their research was incredible, but sadly an accident occurred and you know what happened. The authorities of the United States and the scientists of these catastrophe speculate that the 90% of the population had switch bodies. So I ask to all the students to go to the gym where we are expecting to find your body and wait to the authorities if they can find a fast solution to this problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the students stand up and go to the gym and I followed them. When we arrived there was a big crowd of people screaming and discussing, but all the people stood silent when the principal enter the place. Curiously he wasn\u00b4t the one that speak to the students because he was only a boy inside that body. The one who really talked to all of us was the Jena, the cafeteria lady. Her, in reality his words were very simple, to find your real body and stay together until an authority of the city said what they should do. I immediately saw my old body, but something strange make me stay in my place without moving, waiting for the real Tony to appear. However in more than an hour, nobody came. I look some people that talk in different languages or said that came from places very far as Australia. I did not wanted to think but what would happen if Tony is in a very far place, then I could easily pretend to be Tony and that I have always been him. That form of thinking start to bothered me, because some ours ago I was criticizing my new being, but the idea of being respected by all, being admired as the local hero that won a kick-boxing championship and the star of the football, being strong and popular started to appeal to me. I didn\u00b4t know what to do, because there was always the possibility that the real tony appeared and reclaim what it was his. Of course there was the possibility that the change was permanent but it was better that all believed that inside was the popular Tony than the outcast Evan. I look to two people talking to the principal and after another hour nobody came. I was now sure that the old Jock was not in the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old cafeteria girl come near to me and said: \"Boy, why are you standing there? why you don\u00b4t look for your real body?\".<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose Principal- I answered surprised that she come specifically to talk with me- I am not looking because all these is insane\"<br>\r\n\"All people is shock, but you are the only one that stayed calm, you haven\u00b4t move from that spot and that took my attention. Why you don\u00b4t tell me your name maybe we could find faster your real body because all the students if you haven\u00b4t noticed find their real body\". Until that moment I didn\u00b4t realize but almost every student and member of the faculty were grouped in a side of the gym. I have to make a decision fast to lie and said that I was someone that I really wasn\u00b4t or said the truth and look the guy that was wearing my old flesh, Evan flesh.<br>\r\n\"All these insane- I started saying- I don\u00b4t understand anything of these or why it happened?\"<br>\r\n\"I understand son, accepting the circumstance is the first step\"<br>\r\n\"But principal, I don\u00b4t have anything to accept, I am Tony, Tony Coletta. I don\u00b4t understand why but i doesn\u00b4t change\"<br>\r\n\"I am really happy for you Tony, I have to said that you are very lucky becouse only, counting you of course. three students weren\u00b4t affect by these situation, you don\u00b4t have to stay here, why you don\u00b4t go home\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was trembling, I have lied to the principal but I didn\u00b4t feel bad. I go out of the Gym as one of the three that do not suffer a body swap. I know that if form to reverse the  body swap exist I was escaping to these solution. I start to think that I have really steal the identity of this Jock and now I have to decide what to do first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I go out of the gym and go to my locker but just before I arrive to it, I remembered that now I was Tony and my locker was in another part. That make me fear a little bit, because I can easily generate doubts of my identity if I doesn\u00b4t get the number to open the locker. But that was something that I can later discover, right know the important thing was getting out of the school. Now in the parking I start to think where I should go. I think in my home and in my family, they should be worried about how I am and ,of course, I was worried too; but if I wanted success stealing the life of the greatest Jock in our school   I can never return to my old house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to start a new life and the best place to find information of how I should act was obviously Tony\u00b4s house. I go to the street to take the bus, but when I look for Tony\u00b4s wallet in my pocket I found something great, the keys of Tony\u00b4s car. I rapidly run to that enormous jeep. I have seen it many times , always carrying the most beautiful girls or many of the most popular guys and right now it was all mine. I entered the car and stayed in silent admiring the great machine that I never imagine to be in. Then I take the wallet and examined it, credit cards, several id and a memberships of some of the most famous clubs in the city. I start the travel to my new house. I put the radio for a moment but there was no music, only reports of the greatest body swap in human history and the probability that a second body swap could occur. I did not pay a lot attention to the news because there was my new home, the greatest house I have ever seen. The house has a great garden, perfect for parties, and also has its own pool. There were some cool cars outside of the house like an Audi and then I understand something, I was not only a Jock but the son  of one of the richest guys in the city. I entered the house with precaution. i didn\u00b4t want to find anyone, because I was prepared to lie to the high school principal but not to Tony\u00b4s Family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI explored fast the house, trying to find information of my new family. I discovered that my new father was the CEO of an important company and my new mother had a chain of beauty salons.  I have also an older brother that apparently is actually a layer and a smaller sister that surely is going to remain the one that i had in my older life. I explored my house and find basic information of my new family, mainly the favorite things that each one of them like to do, But anything said to me how was the relationship with the new me. At the end I find my new room there were armani exchange and abercrombie and diesel clothes in the ground. I see a desk with a lap and like a hundredth of movies and music CDs. It was four time bigger than my older room and I have to admit it was really cool. There were trophies of different sports and several porn, sports and car magazines on the floor. I opened his closet and explored it and then I do the same with his computer. Luckily his computer didn\u00b4t had a password and his mail neither, so during the next hours I read his mail, his conversations and everything that would help me to impersonate Tony the best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I go to Tony\u00b4s bathroom, he had one of his own and that was incredible. I look to his lotions, razor and then I look for the first time totally calmly to the mirror. I move my face and see how tony\u00b4s face looks like, and then it was time to explore the rest of my body. As I take my shirt of I see my great chest and my eight pack, I look my big arms and imagine all the time that Tony has to be in a gym, and all the time that I would have to be in it. Thankfully i later discover than less of an hour daily and the football and boxing sessions would be enough to have this body. But my exploration   wasn\u00b4t over I have to discover what was under my jeans, I am not going to describe it, but just think that I am very happy with this concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was dressing up again, I heard the main door open, i put the rest of my clothes and run to see who was the one that just arrived. And then I saw him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a postman entering my new house. I asked who he was and to identify himself, but stood quit with a look of terror in his face. \"My name is Tony Coletta and you are in my body\" he answered. The situation was terrible I never expected that the real Tony was going to appear and demand his body. i could have Tony body, but inside I was still Evan, so when I heard that words from the postman I started to fear what he can make to me if he discovered that I lied in his body to the principal or if I read his mails or even worst if he discovered that I had explore his body. \"So you are Tony\" I said slowly with my deep voice. \"Yes and I want to know who the hell are you\" respond the angry fat and old postman. I don\u00b4t know why but my answer was fast and confident that could even fool the best detective in the united states, I said that my name was Derek Cards and that I was from las vegas, I don\u00b4t know why I said that but it was better and secure than saying that I was the boy that all the days he bullied in school. My lie convinced Tony and we start to talk about the strange accident that just recently occurred and how we are going to return to our old bodies. It was the fist time that I talk to him, he was very funny, stupid jokes of course but I believe that if he wasn\u00b4t a jerk all the time we could even being friends. But more than a friendly conversation, I was paying attention to the mannerism when he was talking. I was completely sure that I can perfectly copy them with some practice and even in that moment having the real Tony in front of me I hadn\u00b4t resigned to my new found popularity and muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tony asked for his cellphone, but then again I lied and said him that I didn\u00b4t know where it  was. I have no desire to give him a prove that he was the real owner of this body. After some time of talking I give him a beer and start to drink. I was drinking moderately but I push Tony to drink more and more until he lost consciousness. Of course I obtain more information during the process as his relation with his father and his credit card passwords. Its incredible what you can obtain through the alcohol. I stayed in silence looking at the body of that old postman. I think that I should killed that guy, for all the time that he made me to drink the water in the toilets, but when I saw the body of the postman that idea flew away. I stood there without knowing to know what to do, but my body moved to act and I wasn\u00b4t really conscious,  but I think it was the correct decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go to my jeep and put the postman in the back seat and then I drive to a near town where I put the body in a street. I was sure that Tony was going to be okay, but I was also sure that he would be bother again in a few days. The chaos in the city continue, the amount of robberies increase and the police had put the greatest alarm because one of the most dangerous serial murderer in our city was free, maybe in the body of a child or an old lady. In the news they also talked about a solution that was being made in the laboratories. I continue driving and then a policeman stop my car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop your car, you little shit\" shout the man in the blue uniform as he take his gun and pointed to my head. I slowly stood out of the jeep with the fear that this was my end and I really didn\u00b4t have the opportunity to enjoy these new body. Thankfully a strong wind start to blew and an earthquake start to move everything around us. It was for real a second  wave of body swap was coming. I closed my eyes and pray to stay in this body.</span></div></div>",

I was in the street and when I look up I saw Tony with a big smile in his face. <br>\r\n\"I have to admit it you little shit, you have an awesome body, sorry, you had an awesome body. Why I am going to steal your car when I can take your whole life, and with this new body, with great a look can get several chicks and make them scream as I fuck them.\" said the new Tony in a perverse way, deducing that I was the jock before by my reactions when I saw him standing in front of me.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" I asked him, unconscious of the danger that I was in that moment.<br>\r\n\"My name you ask, well, it doesn\u00b4t make any damage if I told to you. Look for a Max in the police records, you are now in the body of one. But remember these very well, from this moment, I am you and I would always be you, so don\u00b4t try to follow me or stop me because I am going to kill you, did you understand?\".<br>\r\n\"Yes, I understand\". I answered to that strong guy that was laughing and start to kick me. It remembered me how the real Tony was with me and then I was almost completely beaten on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later I found myself in the police nursery. I felt tired and very weak. I think about the one that has Tony\u00b4s body, Max, and started to understand how delicate was the situation. How many killers and dangerous man were running outside in the body of others I asked myself. Then I felt really bad because my lies and stupid acts lead that a dangerous person was there in the body on Tony and probably was going to kill or damage someone. I hardly stand up but what I think was a nurse stopped me and make me stay in bed. I pass the night in the nursery and slept very bad only a few hours. I cannot believe that in the morning I was evan and spent almost ten hours in tony\u00b4s body and now I am a stranger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day I felt a lot better. a radio was near my bed and well telling the news of these great catastrophe that covered the world in chaos. The news talk about the second shock that was released form a laboratory in new york. The worrying part of this phenomenon is that only one scientist of the program was still trying to solve the problem while the rest are now wondering different bodies, so it is very difficult to calculate when the lab is going to be stabilized, so it was very probable that a third shock could occur during the next hours or days. But also they mentioned that the effect wasn\u00b4t so strong and only the 70% of the population changed body. While I listen to the notice a young cop enter the room, he seemed to me that just graduated form the police Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officer Park\" said the young man.<br>\r\n\"In what I can help you\" I answered, without negating the identity that the boy just gave me.<br>\r\n\"I can look like a rookie but remember that I am still your superior\" said the man, with an angry tone in his voice.<br>\r\n\"I am sorry, sir\" <br>\r\n\"Park, some citizens said that you tried to stop a delinquent just after the second wave. The police apartment is proud of you but take the rest of the day free. You deserve it\".<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir\" I said and then stand up and go out of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor me the police apartment was not a strange image, there were several people working almost no one was using uniform, but all were adults. That was a good thing because there was no children swapped with a policeman that could be something very dangerous, and almost all the workers seemed comfortable with their bodies, so more probably all of them have a certain luck with their swap. I see a bunch of papers, that were the crime reports of that day. And only by looking at them it was very easy to understand that the damage in just these small city was great. A person called my new name, it needed to repeat my name several times until I understand that they were calling me. You cannot blame me, is not that in a few hours someone can adapt that all the people named you as Ryan Park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person that called me was a beautiful woman. I have to admitted that was even more beautiful that any girl in my high school. She said me that both of us were really lucky because any of the both had changed bodies- If she only knew- and after a hot kiss that she gave me I immediately assumed that she was my wife.  She insisted to go home, but then I started to think about that men, Max, that could make atrocities in Tony\u00b4s body, but also I was afraid of confronting this guy and now I have a wife.</span></div></div>",

I was still in the body that once I could have only dreamed of having.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" The new cop asked.<br>\r\n\"I'm Tony Colleta\", I said with a smile. \"But you don't need to worry about that. Who are you?\"<br>\r\nThe cop looked down at his badge and said. \"Well I guess I'm Officer Reynolds.\"<br>\r\nI smiled again.

Was he going to mess up my plans of taking over Tony's life for good? I stopped to look at my new face in the hallway mirror. No-one was going to take it away from me now, not even Tony himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who were you originally?\" I asked Kieron as I handed him some chicken from the fridge.<br>\r\nHe let out a laugh and almost choked on the food.<br>\r\n\"An ex-con down on my luck. Shitty apartment, slut of a girlfriend\", he said. \"Now look at me! I'm the fucking long arm of the law. Thankyou very much Officer Reynolds!\"<br>\r\n\"What about Officer Reynolds?\" I asked.<br>\r\n\"Fuck him\", he said. \"Hopefully hes permanently out of the picture. If not I'll arrest him for impersonating a police officer.\"<br>\r\nHe laughed long and hard at his own joke.<br>\r\n\"Anyway Tony\", he said and I liked being called that. \"I need a shower I think. Get to know the new me properly eh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found him a guest room with en-suite and left him to it. As I closed the door he was already half undressed and grinning like a cheshire cat. I dreaded to think what he was going to get up to in the shower.<br>\r\nI went to Tony's, I mean my room and closed the door. I picked up a photo album and flicked through it studying every picture of Tony so as to learn as much as I could about him. I let Tony's face smile smugly as I acknowledged that these were pictures of me, the hottest jock in town.<br>\r\nMy eyes wandered to the porn magazines i had found earlier and I felt a stiffening in my jeans. I lifted my muscular body off of the bed and went to pick one up when suddenly the doorbell rang again.

I hatched a plot to stay as Tony Coletta for good.<br>\r\n\"What a weird guy !\" I exclaimed loudly to attract Phoebe and Kieron's attention.<br>\r\n\"Is everything all right ?\", They asked in unison. <br>\r\nThen I told them about a guy who claimed to be me, and demanded his body back. I also lied that he threatened to kill me after he got my body.<br>\r\n\"What a horrible thing ! Who could say something like that ?\", Phoebe said.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, my friend. I am a police officer, and it is my responsibility to protect innocent people, just like you.\" Kieron reassured me. \"Thanks\", I replied.<br>\r\nWhen the real Tony entered the mansion, Phoebe, Kieron and I was hiding behind the door. Before he could react, we hit him continually until he was unconscious. <br>\r\n\"I recognized this guy. He was the most dangerous serial murderer in the city.\" Kieron said. I sat thought deeply what I should do with Tony now.</span></div></div>",

He was sentenced to death and the execution was held in the same day. Everything was back to normal, everyone was sent back into their right bodies, except Evan who was nowhere to be found. His parents were miserable, but they got over it soon. The students noticed a few differences in Tony Coletta. It seemed he was friendlier, more intelligent and mature.

Mr. Tomlin's face suddenly looked even more skull-like than usual, but I only had time to wonder (illogically) if I'd suddenly acquired X-ray vision when the wind hit. Softly, but gently, like a very large pillow. But if it was a pillow, it was one swung by an irresistibly strong arm; and I was suddenly as light as down. It lifted me from my chair, and for a moment it seemed as though my stomach would not be joining the rest of my body on this very unexpected journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then ... An eternity later ... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a snap and a jolt, and everything was back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it would have been back to normal, if I were still in Mr. Tomlin's class instead of\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Cunningham?\" The voice was very soft, but it rang out like a shout, for no one else in the room had been making a sound. In fact, it had been so silent that only the sudden jolt of that voice made us realize that a profound stillness had been hanging over everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy neck felt very stiff, and it seemed to crack when I shifted to look for the speaker. Nia Lewis it was who had raised her hand. Mrs. Cunningham, the history teacher standing at the front of the room, and most of the students, were staring at her in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Cunningham,\" Nia repeated, and her tone sounded very plaintive. \"Should I move back to my seat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher looked around, her eyes staring in surprise and horror. I shifted in my desk and looked around uneasily. I wasn't supposed to be in here at all, I was supposed to be in Tomlin's math class, and if Nia thought she needed permission to move back\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hand shot up. \"Mrs. Cunningham, I'm supposed to be in Coach Willis's algebra class,\" said Josh Coffman, one of the chess club whizzes, and a kid who had aced the AP Calculus class his junior year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm supposed to be\u2014\" started another voice, and then a sudden babble broke over the whole room. I looked around in confusion. Had everyone gone mad? Or was it just me? Suddenly Nia began to scream. She pointed at Tracy Sandoval, who was two rows over, and covered her mouth with her other hand and let loose a yelp so loud and high-pitched that everyone winced. \"Nia!\" someone snarled, but she paid no heed, and only kept pointing and screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still screaming when a terrific roar and boom broke over the school, and then her screams were quickly swallowed and blended with the agonized screaming of tearing metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nI didn't find a mirror until well after the change, but there were enough windows in the school\u2014tinted with a reflective material\u2014to settle the question quickly enough. With everyone else I'd risen to my feet and tried stampeding from the room, but even in that panic I'd been briefly transfixed at finding my skin many shades darker than it should have been, and at finding myself unaccountably clad in floppy athletic shorts. I stared and swallowed when I got outside and glanced at a window, tilted just right against the angled sun, and in it recognized Omar Baez's astonished face gazing back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped and ran my fingers through my hair, and saw the shadow in the window pane do the same. I dropped my hands and looked down at dusky, well-manicured fingers\u2014so much stronger and thicker and better maintained than my own well-bitten digits. Strong forearms, with dark, soft hair, well-tanned even for one of Turco-Persian ancestry. My eyes drifted back up to the window; my mouth (<i>my</i> mouth!) was agape, and even in the dim reflection I could see the strong, white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omar!\" Probably it was only because I'd been staring and thinking that name to myself that I turned. A guy\u2014a freshman, by the look of him\u2014I'd never seen before came hurrying up, his face twisted as though trying to hold back tears. He stopped short and stared at me, and I must have stared back. His brow clouded. \"You're not Omar, are you?\" he said, and his voice cracked. \"No one is,\" he said bitterly before I could answer, and hurried away, his head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm not Omar,</i> I thought to myself. <i>Except, somehow, I am. Am I?</i> I looked back at the window in a daze, and then turned and followed the rest of the students and teachers, who had begun to stream, and then to run, from the school, and from the stench and rumble of burning jet fuel, and from the thick, oily column of smoke that billowed over the athletic fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe street in front of the school was a knotted pile of trucks and cars; most of them abandoned, a few trying to nose their way through. People were wandering through the mess. They'd poured out of cars, poured out of the storefronts on the other side of the street from the school, poured down the street from all other directions and fought each other to pass. They passed through and they passed on, all crying and shouting; most were frightened, some angry, all bewildered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around despairingly. Everyone was yelling and clutching at each other, their voices hoarse and ragged already, and no one could hear or understand anyone else. Corinne might have been in that mess. Ryan too. Others I knew. Even the real Omar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI patted the front of Omar's shorts (my shorts?) and found the keys to the crisp, clean, brand-new truck that he drove. It was the envy of the school, a present from his very rich parents, a reward for the no-hitter game he'd pitched against Milliwick at the end of the baseball season. It was, said everyone, a taste of things to come. Great things were expected of Omar as a professional baseball player. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere didn't seem much point in trying to drive through the mess, but I couldn't bear the thought of passing up the truck, so I pushed my way through the crowds and into the parking lot, and found it. I tried the remote control lock, and surprised myself with my own surprise when the truck chirped in reply. In a daze, I reached out to open the driver's side door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omar!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time I jumped, guiltily. I looked around, and felt myself pale when I saw her. <i>You are in so much shit now ...</i> the thought flashed across my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omar,\" Lynne Chapman said again, more softly. She looked at me with an anxious, pleading expression. I stared and swallowed. Lynne Chapman, of the vivid green eyes and luscious red hair, of the firm but petite body and the shallow, swinging hips; Lynne Chapman, the flirty, teasing, mischievous pixie, who only talked to people who were of her social standing. Lynne Chapman, Omar Baez's girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is you, isn't it?\" she said, the pleading tone still in her voice. \"I saw you turn around when that guy called you ... And just now ... So ...\" She trailed off. Her eyes widened, and tears welled up in them, and she gulped. \"Everyone else ... They're not ... They are all ... different. But you're not. Right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said nothing. My heart pounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gulped again, and her mouth trembled. \"Well, I'm not, either. I mean, I'm me. I'm Lynne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared. Did Lynne Chapman ... Did Lynne Chapman really take me for Omar Baez? If I said \"Yes, it's me, I'm Omar,\" how long could I get away with it before Omar himself showed up? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lynne gulped again, and her chest heaved. And as the top button of her sweater popped open, to show the faintly freckled swell of her bosoms, I realized it was not a question I really gave a shit about. I'd chance anything to get my hands on those breasts, to cover her mouth with mine, to sink  my cock like a shaft into her soft, moist pussy. What did it matter how long I could get away with a deception, if I could have her even just <i>once ...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me,\" I said, and reached out to stroke her throat with my (yes, <i>my!</i>) fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nWe drove through crowded streets and down alleys and even along sidewalks. We passed abandoned police cruisers. Once, we saw a fire truck tearing madly down the street, only to come to grief when it flew over a sharp curb and through the plate-glass front of a restaurant. There was a thin pall of smoke over the city, from a dozen white and gray and black plumes, but there were no sirens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe gradually made our way out of the city and into some farmland, and parked on a dirt road that led off toward a ranch-style house in the middle of some fields. The atmosphere between us was fraught. We talked a little, speculating on what had happened. I mostly kept quiet, in a way that probably seemed gruff\u2014I didn't want to say anything incriminating. She, on the other hand chattered, but in a disconnected way, and constantly cut herself short with abrupt silences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you suppose we ought to go home?\" she finally said. \"What do you think we'll find?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our parents?\" I said reluctantly. Would I be able to fool the ones waiting at Omar's house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it <i>will</i> be them?\" she said, and I felt a bizarre sense of relief at the thought that maybe they had switched as well. And then I thought of my own mother and sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should check anyway,\" I said, and turned the key in the ignition. Suddenly, despite my urgent desire to keep Lynne close to me, I wanted very much to get rid of her so I could look for my real family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynne said nothing, and it was only after we'd gotten some distance back into the suburbs that I realized I didn't know exactly where she lived. She took my aimless wandering patiently, though; maybe she thought I was just doing my best to avoid the worst tangles of abandoned vehicles. But I had begun to sweat nervously, and was grateful for the break, when she spotted a gas station and suggested I should top off the truck's gas tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no one inside the mart when I checked, so I just flipped all the pumps on and fueled without paying. But Lynne had apparently had her fill of detours, and when I was back in the cab she quickly suggested a route to her house. It was tricky in spots, for we had to pass more than one burning apartment building, but we made it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw her to the door and accompanied her inside, but there was no one there. By now I was feeling frantic myself, and was trying to get away. Lynne tried clinging to me, though, and I had to shake her off a little rudely. \"Pick me up tomorrow for school?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an odd thought. \"Think there'll be any?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"Seven thirty, then.\" She tugged at the front of my t-shirt, and I bent down and snatched a clumsy kiss\u2014the only real physical contact we'd had all afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThere was no one at my house, and no one answered the cell phones when I tried them. Omar's cell phone only registered calls from before the ... event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat in my old living room and flipped on the TV. Most of the channels were dark. The news networks were a chaos, with very haggard-looking anchormen and anchorwomen babbling confusedly to cover otherwise awkward silences. Most looked like they'd been weeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne channel showed the White House burning, and then a voice off-camera shouted obscenities and the screen cut back to a dazed news reader. He apologized profusely to the audience for the \"disturbing sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvening fell, and still no one returned home. The TV remained uninformative. Though I hardly felt tired, I went upstairs and threw myself onto my own bed and draped my arm over my forehead. I tried both to think and to shut out the feelings of horror that lapped over my mind. The battle soon exhausted me, and then I knew nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nThe alarm woke me early the next morning, and I showered. Omar, I knew, was a fine athlete in impeccable physical condition, but the day's dark prospects meant I hardly paid attention as I washed the night's grime off. I put on the same shorts and t-shirt and ball cap and didn't bother to cut back the thick, day-old growth of beard that showed when I looked in the bathroom mirror. I winced at the undisguised fear in the eyes that looked back at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one had returned during the night, and I wanted very much to stay around. But I had promised Lynne that I'd pick her up; and, anyway, there seemed no immediate prospect of my family returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found Lynne waiting for me at the end of the street. She, at least, looked freshly done up; and if there was trepidation in her voice at least her smile was one of relief when she said \"Hi\" to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fires had either burned out or been put out during the night, but there was an acrid odor over the town. It was strongest near the school, where the crashed jetliner still smoldered. There were no fire engines or ambulances or police cars nearby, and I trembled to think of what one might find in the wreckage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome students, mostly guys, milled around the front, but there was nothing like organization, or the hint that there would be classes. I put my arm (protectively!) around Lynne as we got out in the teacher's parking lot and slowly made our way toward the main building. The students, only a few of which I recognized, eyed us watchfully. \"<i>You</i> picked up a good-looking body,\" one of the guys taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't pick up nothin',\" I said, glaring back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't talking to you, asshole,\" he replied, and his lips pulled back as he eyed Lynne. She shrank against my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone seen ...\" I groped for the names of some of Omar's friends. \"Anyone seen Tony Coletta around?\" I asked. There were smirks in reply, and crafty glances. \"So who are you guys,\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kobe Bryant,\" smirked one fat kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taylor Lautner,\" jeered another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barak Obama,\" laughed a third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omar, sweetie,\" murmured Lynne. I hugged her closer, and we turned to make our way back toward the truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe'd not gone far when I heard the running footsteps behind us. I'd just time to flinch when I felt the blow to the side of my head. Lynne screamed as I wheeled and brought my hands up. It was \"Taylor Lautner,\" grinning madly. He swung at my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know if I had some of Omar's reflexes in me, or if I was thinking fast, or if I was just lucky. But I stepped back and only felt his fist whiff at the air. I balled up my own fist and punched him hard in the rib cage with an underarm blow. He howled and dropped. But there were others running up, and some of them were grabbing at Lynne. The fat kid tried to grab me and I staggered under his weight. A skinny girl with long, dirty hair grabbed at my skull. I pushed and kicked and swore, and I somehow got free of them. \"Lautner\" was on his feet again, his face black with anger, and he charged at me. Again, either luck or latent skill saved me, and I tripped him as he charged by. As he sprawled on the ground, a wave of anger, so strong it nauseated me, swept from the pit of my stomach to the roots of my hair, and I raised my leg and stomped him hard on the side of his face as he lay. He didn't move after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wheeled to face the others, and could feel my eyes staring from my head. But they shrank back. I felt a tug at my shirt, and caught myself just in time to not elbow Lynne hard in the face. I put my arm around her and led her back to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nWe wound up back in the countryside, not far from the spot we'd camped the previous afternoon. Whatever terror Lynne had felt quickly dissolved into warm, wet, tender attention to <i>me.</i> We were sitting in the truck's bed, and she was <i>cooing</i> as she held me tightly. \"What did you do last night?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Went home,\" I said brusquely, and nuzzled the top of her head. \"No one was there. Watched TV and went to bed.\" Nothing I said was untrue, but it wasn't quite the way she would have taken it. \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same.\" She picked at the front of my shirt, and reached up to lightly bite the side of my neck. \"Except someone came home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your folks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"I guess. Maybe. I don't really know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking about you.\" Without warning, she threw a leg over my lap and sat on top of me, staring deeply into my eyes. She cradled her hands around my shoulders and neck. \"I couldn't stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started grinding her pelvis against mine and ran her tongue over her bottom lip.  My cock felt like a spring had sprung inside it. She must have felt it, for her eyes started dancing merrily, and she laughed ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... and suddenly I couldn't stop thinking about the last time I'd seen her laugh while looking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It was at Nick Waggoner's house, just at the start of summer break. A pool party. I was there only because my buddy Ryan was there, and he was there only because he'd helped Waggoner pass his history final. We felt very self-conscious of our skinny bodies as we sat at the shallow end while the Nick and the other burly football players taunted and shoved each other at the deep end, to the appreciative attentions of Stacey Everett and Olivia Washington and Nia Lewis and the other busty, popular girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one there I might have had a chance with was Seri Carver. I don't quite know where she ranked in the pecking order; that's a topology whose mathematics are beyond me. But even if she had a slightly masculine face and a flat chest and a bony ass, there was something very graceful\u2014almost fawn-like\u2014in the way she carried herself, and she was smart and confident in a way that didn't make a guy feel shriveled. Her family had money, too, which might have been one of the reasons the cheerleaders let her hang out with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, she was the one I was watching that afternoon, as she talked to and laughed with the other girls, even though she was never quite at the center of their chattering circle. I must have been staring at her as she went into the house at one point, and one of the girls must have seen me staring, because shortly after she disappeared I heard Lynne calling my name. \"Bring me another Diet Coke?\" she called, and held up her empty bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced at Ryan, then shrugged and went into the house. Lynne and her friends were laughing when I got back, and Lynne looked up at me with a mischievous but friendly glance. \"You like Seri, don't you?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must have looked startled or embarrassed, because Lynne tsked at me and smiled. \"Don't be shy. When I say 'like' I don't mean you have a crush on her. I just mean, well, that you like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I like her,\" I shrugged uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynne's dimples deepened. \"You know, she has a crush on <i>you.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were titters all around, and I felt my cheeks flame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm serious,\" Lynne continued. \"It's not the kind of crush where she keeps writing your name over and over in her notebook.  But she thinks you're really cute, and she'd be really flattered if you asked her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I'll do that sometime,\" I said. I badly wanted to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what,\" said Lynne. \"You go back over there with your friend. I'll tell her something, like, that you need another Coke. If she's interested in you, she'll go get one and bring it to you. You know, like you brought one to me.\" There was something slightly nasty and mocking in the way she held up her drink. \"And when she does, you give her a kiss. Not on the mouth. Just a peck on the cheek, to let her know she's appreciated. She'll like that, and one thing will lead to another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held her eye, but she gazed back serenely, and I was so discombobulated I had to look away to end them smarting. I caught the other girls madly grinning at each other as I turned away, but like an idiot I thought maybe they were just thrilled at the thought of playing matchmaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, not long after, I saw Seri go back into the house and then come back out with a Coke, which she brought over to me. She was smiling in a very friendly way as she handed it to me. I hadn't intended to act on Lynne's advice, but I suddenly felt like I would be very foolish not to take a chance. I jumped to my feet, took the bottle, and planted a quick kiss on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert!\" she screamed, and slapped me. It wasn't a hard blow, but it caught me off-balance and I fell into the pool. The water, at least, temporarily drowned out the screams of laughter from the girls, but when I came back to the surface I looked up to see Lynne laughing so hard she could barely breathe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I fucked her. I fucked her until she screamed and sagged against me, and even as she sagged limply against me I continued ramming my spent but angry cock into her dripping cunt. I hurt but I felt numb, too; numb below the waist and above the neck, numb because even as I was drinking deeply of Lynne's physical charms I was also savoring the knowledge that it was her boyfriend's cock I was using to fuck her, and savoring the knowledge that she thought it was her boyfriend fucking her, and savoring the knowledge that she thought he was fucking her because he loved her so much. <i>That</i> would be something to throw back in her face when I dumped her back at her house, and told her who I really was, and why I'd done it. <i>That</i> would be sweet revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent the rest of the morning and most of the afternoon there in the country. I'd leave her by the truck and wander about chucking rocks until she'd recovered her strength and I'd recovered mine. When she suggested finding something to eat, I suggested she give me a blow job, and she got a wicked grin and obliged. And when she complained of soreness I told her I wouldn't mind taking her up the ass, and again she obliged. And still I had an erection when, out of boredom, we drove back into town, and I gripped and jammed the stickshift between gears and popped the clutch and gunned the motor and otherwise did lots of manly things with the truck while she rubbed my six-pack (<i>my six-pack!</i>) with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe became more ardent and insistent the closer we got to her house, and as we pulled up she asked if she could spend the night at my house, with me, in my bed. I looked down at her stonily. In my head I had the perfect reply, telling her <i>whose</i> bed, exactly, she was asking to sleep in, and why he wouldn't be obliging. I glanced over her head, and saw an older man standing in the door to her house. She followed my gaze, then turned her head and shrank up against me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my dad,\" she whispered in a horrified voice. \"Except ... it's <i>not.</i> He left me alone last night. But ... I'm so scared ...\" She trailed off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first, I wasn't sure I believed her. I mean, I was quite certain that that wasn't her <i>father</i> watching us from the front yard. But I wasn't sure whether she really felt afraid of him. After all, she hadn't been afraid of <i>me</i> ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then I caught the look\u2014the expression of amused malice\u2014on the face of her \"father,\" and I knew that Lynne would be a fool not to feel terror. She clung close to me as we slowly got out of the truck cab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a solidly middle-aged man, with curly gray hair and a fat gray moustache and paunch that his lime-green sweater did nothing to hide. \"Thanks for bringing my little girl home,\" he said in a voice that was surprisingly nasal. \"You keep her safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a start on it,\" I said, and pulled Lynne closer to my side. \"We're just here to pick up some of her stuff. She'll be staying with me from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who are you?\" the man challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm her boyfriend,\" I replied. \"And who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm her father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it.\" I tilted my chin, and gave Lynne a slight push toward the house. \"Go on, get your stuff. I'll wait for you out here, talk things over with your ... dad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly Lynne shuffled toward the house. The man briefly glanced at her as she passed, but I recaptured his attention by shifting back onto my heels and rolling my shoulders. Unless he had been a martial artist in his previous life, I doubted he would want to tangle with me. But there was no harm in warning him that I was ready for trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held my eye steadily, and grinned, but I could see the sweat standing out on his brow. \"Some people have all the luck,\" he eventually said. \"You know, if I'd gotten that body\u2014\" He grinned at me\u2014\"instead of this one.\" He licked his lips and didn't finish the thought. I ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know why he wanted to talk, but he kept on. \"You know each other long?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably I shouldn't have answered. \"If you really were her dad you'd know the answer to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's it a secret?\" he said. \"I just wondered if you and her, you know, before\u2014\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everyone got switched.\" Despite myself, I flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know who <i>she</i> says she is. I want to\u2014\" He stopped short. \"What, you're saying that <i>you</i>\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" I felt a muscle in my cheek twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened, and then his glance grew even more malicious. \"Imagine that.\" He sniggered softly. \"A boy and a girl, so much in love that not even a miracle can snap the bond between them. What a cute, <i>unbelievable</i> story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't care if you believe it or not,\" I shouted, balling up my fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned. \"No, I guess it doesn't matter if I believe you. All that matters is that <i>she</i> believes you, right?\" I wanted very much to punch him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm ready!\" To my relief, Lynne hadn't wasted time, and she rushed out the front door and past us and to the truck with a little suitcase clutched tightly to her chest. Her sudden reappearance startled me, and it must have startled her \"father,\" for we accidentally exchanged glances. He laughed, nastily, as I put a proprietary arm around Lynne's shoulders. \"Yeah, you take good care of her, or, you know, I'll just have to come kick your ass.\" I pulled her close. \"If he takes advantage of you,\" the man called to her, \"you know you can always come back home. I'll treat you right!\" She shrank up next to the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe didn't say much on the subsequent drive. She seemed preoccupied at her escape. Me, I kept looking in the rearview mirror, but there was no sign of pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nI'd taken the precaution earlier in the afternoon of glancing at Omar's drivers license, so I knew where to find his house. It was, I wasn't surprised to find, out in one of the better developments on the outskirts of the city. A big house, set back in a large yard and hidden from the street by a high wall and a screen of trees. Everything inside was quiet and undisturbed. Creepily so. At worst, the house had probably been empty for only a day, but it had already acquired a shabby feeling of abandonment. Surely it was just my imagination; at the same time, though, I hoped it <i>was</i> abandoned. I was sure I wouldn't like it if Omar's parents returned, whether they were in their original bodies or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe found plenty of food in the pantry and refrigerator, which was lucky, because we had no idea how or even whether we'd be able to find more food. Traffic near the supermarkets and major restaurants had been impassible, with lots of wrecked and abandoned cars, and I fearfully guessed there was some serious looting going on. So Lynne and I cooked up and ate some of the perishable stuff, saving the canned and dried stuff for later. After that we sat in the living room, holding each other. I'm not sure what she was thinking, but I was trying not to think about the future. At least, not yet. Tomorrow I would have to take a chance on going into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, we slept, and the stresses and strains of the day were such that didn't even have any fun beforehand. I don't know how it was for her, but sleep took me like ropes dragging me down beneath a pounding surf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it happened I was to be spared an expedition into town, for Omar's father showed up the next day, around nine in the morning. Or, to be more precise about it, a dark-haired, dark-skinned man who looked like an older version of Omar showed up. I didn't ask for identification and he didn't offer any. Nor did he ask me for mine. I was in the kitchen when he opened the back door without knocking, and stuck his head in, and looked around with a hooded, guarded expression that didn't change even after the two of us locked eyes. We both just froze and stared at each other for a moment before I took a chance and nodded at him. He exhaled, and I realized I had been holding my breath too. \"You have anything to eat?\" he asked, and at that moment I realized we were probably not going to be apologizing or making serious inquiries about each other. We were going to be taking each other as we found each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I got him a sandwich, he said he'd be looking through the house, and I joined him. He didn't seem to be looking for anything in particular, but I could tell he was making a careful inventory of what he found, and without planning to I made an inventory right along with him. Most of it, I'll confess, like the huge stack of DVDs, seemed pretty useless, but I refrained from saying so, and he didn't offer much commentary either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had seemed satisfied by the food stock in the pantry, and was plainly relieved when we found a large and very full freezer in the garage. \"They're ransacking all the stores,\" he explained, though I hadn't asked. \"People grabbing anything they can, fighting, shooting each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the police,\" I asked. He snorted, and I realized it had been a stupid question. Who exactly <i>were</i> the police now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he actually looked happy when we found the gun cabinet. \"You know how to use these things,\" he asked as he opened it up. I shook my head. \"Well here, let me give you a quick lesson.\" We spent almost an hour going over the basics. I asked if he expected us to be robbed. \"I'm not worried about money,\" he said. \"Money's worthless now. Even if we get things back up and running again, it's gonna be a different currency. Probably even a different country. No,\" he said grimly, \"it's gonna be <i>things</i> that are valuable. Food, to start with, and cars and gasoline. Later on furniture. There's some nice shit in a house like this, and I'm sure people will be getting <i>ideas.</i>\" I wondered if he had had the same \"idea,\" and that's what had brought him here. But though he was curt and clipped and didn't like looking me in the eye, he seemed content to share the house with us, and to let me and Lynne be. I was especially relieved that he didn't seem to pay much attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe week that followed was fraught. \"Dominic,\" as he asked to be called, seemed to accept that I was pretty much who I appeared to be\u2014a high school student\u2014and took most of the responsibilities upon himself. Basically, this involved going into town on \"expeditions\" for supplies. He also (he said) was trying to set up profitable contacts. In the meantime, he asked only that Lynne and I guard the house while he was away. He also insisted that I get some sleep during the day, because it was my responsibility to keep watch during the night, when he slept. After a day or two I asked Lynne what she thought of him, and she said she had a good feeling about him, and I figured that if he didn't frighten her then he was probably okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Lynne and me, well, we didn't talk much. When Dominic was around we refrained from talking about the old days, because we didn't want to make him feel like a stranger. And when he wasn't around we didn't talk about the old days either. I didn't want to accidentally expose myself, and she seemed to take my reticence to mean that she shouldn't talk about them either. Mostly we spent our time holding each other while sitting on the roof, keeping watch on the street, or fucking when we got aroused. There was a lot of that. At first I couldn't believe how insatiable Lynne was. Then it occurred to me that she was feeling frightened, and looking for safety by being curled up close to a strong, naked guy. I'll confess it made me feel guilty, because I didn't feel nearly as capable as I pretended to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nI did do two things, though, that earned me some credit with Dominic. A few days after he showed up, I noticed that some of the nearby houses had been reoccupied. I armed myself and went investigating. At first, the people I met were suspicious and unfriendly, but after I explained who I was and where I was coming from, most of them warmed. I pointedly refrained from asking if their houses belonged to them, which probably helped. Instead, I gave them a short version of the speech Dominic had given, about how houses like ours were likely to be targeted by looters. I could tell that everyone I talked to had had the same idea\u2014and some looked very guilty about it\u2014so they were receptive when I suggested setting up a neighborhood patrol. Dominic himself was surprised, and pleased, when he returned that evening to find a dozen people in our living room, discussing the logistics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second came at the end of the week, when a woman claiming to be Mrs. Baez showed up. It was plain that she wasn't who she said she was, but Lynne and I treated her indulgently, and Dominic did his best to humor her, even after she broke into the liquor cabinet and got stinking drunk. The next morning she was still drunk, and I found her done up in all of Mrs. Baez's best dresses and jewelry. She tried ordering me and Lynne around after Dominic left, but we ignored her. That evening I caught her trying to sneak out of the house and dragged her back into the living room, where we dumped out the contents of the handbag she'd been clutching in a claw-like hand; Mrs. Baez's considerable cache of prescription drugs came tumbling out. Dominic and I glanced at each other, but I moved before he could: I took her by the arm and led her to the front door and calmly told her that if she ever came back to the house I would shoot her in the face before she would be able to say one word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic smiled at that, and after she was gone he scooped up a bottle of Percodan and murmured that at least she had the right idea; he'd be able to trade the stuff in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Dominic himself, we eventually learned a little bit about him. He had found himself in Mr. Baez's body, sitting in an ornate hotel suite. After spending most of the afternoon trying to puzzle out what had happened, he'd given up, found Baez's car, and set off. Dominic's own home was on the other side of the country, and no one had answered when he'd tried calling, so he'd decided to take his chances on the house of the man whose body he now occupied; he'd figured that a guy who drove a BMW probably was well set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for what happened to the real Baezes (the Mr., the Mrs. and, though I didn't say it, Omar), no one liked to speculate. It was enough to remember that, shortly after the Shift, almost every jetliner had fallen out of the sky, and most of the automobiles had gotten closely acquainted with brick walls and concrete embankments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nAbout ten days after the switch, Dominic asked me to go into town with him. On the way in he explained that he'd be leaving for a bit. He'd been a long-haul truck driver in his previous existence, and over the past few days he'd set up a few deals that had gotten him a rig and some cargo and some contracts to fulfill. He was feeling optimistic\u2014though cautious\u2014that things might be turning around. \"Everyone got hit by the Shift, you know,\" he said as we drove. \"But some places got hit worse than others, and in some places a recovery's started. There's gonna be a demand for transport as goods start moving again. I think we're gonna do okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI asked him if he wanted me to just carry on as before. He sucked on his lower lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I need to talk to you about,\" he said. \"We're not family, not really, but we might as well be. You've got a good head. You keep your cool, and you're smart. Thing is, highways aren't safe anymore, and I'll need someone to ride shotgun with me. And when I say 'shotgun'\u2014\" he looked over at me with a wry but serious expression\u2014\"it's not a figure of speech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't leave Lynne,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said nothing for a bit. \"Don't get me wrong,\" he said at last. \"Lynne's a sweet girl. But she's gotta start paying her way. Right now she thinks she can pay her keep by giving you blow jobs.\" I jumped a little, and he shot me a sharp look. \"I'm not blind, and I think I see things more clearly than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's still a\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanna stay, you can stay while I'm on the road,\" he said, ignoring the look I gave him. \"But it means I'll have to bring in a partner on what\u2014 Aw, hell, I'll tell you right out it's a pretty sweet set of deals I got set up. Payment's gonna be in precious metals. And if you stay, you're gonna have to do <i>something</i> to earn <i>your</i> keep as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like here.\" We'd pulled up in front of a warehouse-type of building. The doors were open, and I could seen machine tools and work benches inside. \"Frank here can put you to work making stuff. You know anything about metal work?\" I shook my head. \"Well, you're a quick study,\" Dominic said, \"and Frank owes me a favor.\" He gave me a very serious look. \"If Lynne can work too, so much the better. But that's for you and her to talk about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll be blunt,\" he said. \"I'd much rather have you on the road with me.\"</span></div></div>",

It was covered with slightly slimy vaginal lubricant. \"Ugh...\" you muttered to yourself, hearing a very feminine voice. Wiping your hand off on your... skirt around your ankles with a yellow thong nestled in it. \"... Wha... What happened?!\" Your feminine voice screeched as your hands shot to your chest, feeling rather small but well formed breasts. With a few gropings, you moved on to your face. A small nose could be felt, smooth features and long straight black hair... also, glasses. A thick pair of \"Stylish\" framed glasses sat upon your small nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost surreally calm, you pulled off a wad of toilet paper and wiped your sensitive bits free of their dripping juices. Careful to avoid the more sensitive spots you dropped it into the toilet and stood up. Your school's bathrooms had the same stalls and in the men's room they were the same... you now stood up almost halfway as you did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so short now...\" Idly playing with the silk-like pubic hair upon your crotch before snapping out of it and quickly pulling up the small yellow thong. Nestling between your new bigger buttocks, you tried to make them more comfortable. Pulling them out. \"How do girls wear these? My Butthole already hurts...\" you mutter again, blushing heavily at the sound of a feminine voice talking about their anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up the skirt, you push open the stall door to find a mirror. Staring back at you was none other than the foreign exchange student, Lim Mei. Easily the shortest student in school, standing at 4'6. She was a senior in high school and 18 years old and of Full Japanese decent. Smiling at the reflection, it did the same like a silent mime. Putting your hands over your mouth as you looked to the side, a sight most unusual... With gasp, a sexual scene was unfolding before you.

Looking around, I quickly realized I was at a table in the school common area.  I also noticed that everyone in the room was in a panic; randomly shaking people and cowering in corners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering how I\u2019d gotten to the common area, I tried getting up only to fall flat on my face.  \u201c<i>What the hell</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning over, I immediately realized something was wrong; I was suddenly wearing boots and I had\u2026breasts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing a hand to my chest, I grabbed the breasts in bewilderment.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped when I heard the voice coming out of my mouth; it definitely wasn\u2019t mine.  Realizing I needed to know what happened; I slowly got to my feet and made my way to the nearest bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took my time with the boot; since I wasn\u2019t used to walking in heels.  I finally made it to the men\u2019s room; going inside while others panicked in the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the sinks, I was surprised by the reflection I saw in the mirror.  Standing before me was an attractive girl with C cup breasts and flowing brown hair down to her waist; wearing a skirt and top.  It didn\u2019t take me long to recognize the girl as Ashley Sawyer; one of the most popular girls in the 10th grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was the only child of a successful businessman; she was <i>very</i> spoiled and always got her way.  She and her two friends, Lisa Martin and Joyce Collins, were the most popular girls in the 10th grade; every boy wanted to date them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I slowly realized that I wasn\u2019t dreaming; that I really was a 16 year old girl, I tried to figure out what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Not surprisingly, my hands quickly found their way to my chest.  I fondled my breasts for a moment before realizing that I should probably figure out what happened to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy time I left the bathroom, I found myself walking in the boots as if I\u2019d always been wearing them.  Figuring that Ashley kept a cell phone in her purse, I made my way back to the table and collected her things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done, I decided that my next task would be to find Corinne.  I wandered the halls of the school for almost an hour; looking for any sign of Corinne.  People were everywhere; yelling at others about stealing their bodies.  I began to wonder why I hadn\u2019t run into Ashley yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching for a while, I was relieved to find Corinne standing outside of the boy\u2019s bathroom.  \u201cCorinne!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to me, Corinne said, \u201cI\u2019m not Corinne, I\u2019m Eric Rogers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric Rogers was a kid in Corinne\u2019s grade.  \u201cEric, I have to find Corinne.  Where were you before all this happened?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI was at home in bed; recovering from the flu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a dead end; as Eric lived clear on the other side of town.  Resigning myself to the fact that I couldn\u2019t get to Corinne anytime soon, I started to wonder what I was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking my way to the nearest stair well, I sat down and thought about what my next move would be.  Going to my house was the logical choice; but that was a 20 minute walk from here.  On the other hand, Ashley\u2019s house was about 10 minutes from the school.  I had her body, so I didn\u2019t see the problem of going to her house for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind made up, I quietly left the building and made my way to Ashley\u2019s.  There was just as much chaos outside as there was in the school; maybe even more because of the cars.  I walked past several car wrecks along the way; not stopping to see if anyone was hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully I got to Ashley\u2019s house without a problem.  She lived in a nice 2 story house in a rich neighborhood; walking up the driveway, I wondered how I was going to explain myself to her parents.  It was then I remembered hearing Ashley say yesterday that her parents were out of town on a business trip for the next week; so she had the house to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging through Ashley\u2019s purse, I found her keys and left myself in.</span></div></div>",

As one of the \u2018unpopular\u2019 kids, I was never invited to parties here; so this was the first time I\u2019d ever seen the inside of her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spotted a lot of photos of Ashley with her parents on vacations; everyone seemed happy in the photos.  Made me a little jealous; my family hadn\u2019t been on many trips since my dad left.  Walking upstairs to Ashley\u2019s room, I found that her parents spared no expense with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a 40 inch plasma TV on her wall; with a high end sound system.  In fact, as I walked around the room, I doubted that nothing here cost less than $600.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on Ashley\u2019s bed, I found myself hating her even more.  She didn\u2019t deserve the life she\u2019d had; she was too spoiled for her own good.  While my life wasn\u2019t terrible, it was nothing like hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I lay down on her bed, I wondered about what I was going to do next.  It wasn\u2019t long before I\u2019d fallen asleep.</span></div></div>",

Looking through her closet, I noticed that she had a lot of high end clothing.  That didn\u2019t surprise me; as Ashley was known for her sense of fashion, she would be caught dead in cheap clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked through her room, it suddenly dawned on me that I could take advantage of this unique opportunity.  Since I wasn\u2019t one of the \u2018popular\u2019 crowd, I\u2019d never have a chance of dating Ashley\u2026she was way out of my league.  Seeing that I was now in her body, I could have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin on my face, I turned and walked into the bathroom.  After closing the door and pulling down the blinds, I turned to face the mirror.  As I undressed myself, I found myself realizing just how attractive Ashley really was.  With that in mind, I suddenly realized that meant I was attractive now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced at the idea of boys being attracted to me; I\u2019d always hoped that I\u2019d have a hot girlfriend and not be the hot girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting myself dressed again, I realized I was getting hungry.  Walking downstairs to the kitchen, I spent the next 15 minutes making myself a quick dinner before heading into the family room to watch TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, I wasn\u2019t surprised that the only thing on was news about what people were calling \u2018The Great Shift.\u2019  It was a complete mystery; no one knew what caused it and if the \u2018shifts\u2019 were reversible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, I got tired of watching the news so I popped a DVD into the player.  Watching the movie, I found myself thinking about how nice of a life Ashley had.  Her parents were still together and loved her very much; she had everything she\u2019d ever want and was the most popular girl in the 10th grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat bugged me about that was she didn\u2019t really deserve this life; she was a spoiled brat who tormented kids at school.  While my family wasn\u2019t terrible; we\u2019d had some problems since dad left us.  I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this; but Ashley has a better life that I do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the couch, I found myself facing a surprising decision\u2026whether or not I should take Ashley\u2019s life for my own.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few days passed by uneventfully; save for some looting in the area.  I was thankful that Ashley's periods were mild; I was having a tough time with it as it was.  It'd been 3 days since I heard from...my parents; which meant they were probably coming home soon.  Part of me wanted to see how my...dad was adjusting to being a pregnant teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd just finished having breakfast when the doorbell rang.  Thinking it was my new parents, I went to the door and was surprised to find my former body standing there.  \"Ashley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Evan.\" Looking at me, he said, \"Looks like you're already developing a fashion sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right in a way; I was wearing a rather feminine skirt today...mainly to see how it looked on me.  Looking at him, I said, \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping inside, Ashley said, \"I thought I'd come by to see how you're doing with my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see I'm doing pretty well.\" Grinning, I said, \"In fact, I'm doing so well I decided to take your life for my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say as I'm surprised.\" Closing the door, Ashley said, \"After all, I've made the same decision about your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" shocked, I said, \"You want to be a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not so much that I want to be a boy.\" Walking into the living room, Ashley said, \"It's more that I've now got a family that actually cares about <br>\r\nme; both your mom and sister are really nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley went onto explain what happened to her since the Shift.  She made her way to my house with Ryan; who was in the body of Tara Johnson, the school slut.  By the time she got home, Corinne had arrived in Eric Roger's body.  Mom had been placed into the body of our 30 year old neighbor, Amber Cunningham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Ashley, after she finished her story, I said, \"Is that enough to want my life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is.\" Looking at me, Ashley said, \"What about you? Why do you want my life so bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom became obsessed with keeping me close after dad left.  I guess she didn't want me to leave her; but she was smothering me.\" <br>\r\nSighing, I said, \"When I found myself in your body, I got a taste of freedom and I liked it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking guilty, I said, \"I kept telling myself that you didn't deserve this life; since you were such a bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lived alone for years; with no rules and no curfews.  I didn't have anyone to tuck me in at night or congratulate me for a good grade.  It was just constant deliveries of food, money and maid service.\" Tearing up, Ashley said, \"Believe me; you'll start acting like I did once you see how good others have it; even without money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it; I'm a much better person than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I'm saying is watch what you wish for...Ashley.\" looking at me, she said, \"You don't truly know someone until you walk in their shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us talked for a while; I mentioned how her...former father was now a pregnant 15 year old girl.  She was concerned for his wellbeing; but couldn't hide the fact that she was amused by the situation.  Apparently they weren't very close; and she felt that her...father being a pregnant teenager was an amusing situation for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up to leave a short time later; after having a quick lunch.  As she walked to the door, I said, \"Thanks for stopping by...Evan; it's nice to see you're alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you...Ashley.\" turning to me, he said, \"Remember what I said.\"</span></div></div>",

After he left, I walked up to my room to watch a movie on Netflix; thankful that the Internet was still working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ended up watching Bridesmaids; which wasn't my first choice but I still found myself enjoying it.  I never cared for chick flicks; but I figured since I was living Ashley's life, I might as well have her taste in movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finished the movie just as I heard a car door close outside.  Getting up, I ran to the window to see a pregnant girl slowly waddling up to the front door.  Realizing that my...parents were home, I rushed downstairs to greet them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got to the bottom of the stairs just as the door opened; with the pregnant girl stepping inside.  I got my first look at her then; she was attractive, with a decent figure and shoulder-length brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to her, slowly, said, \"Daddy?  Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sweetheart.\" Pausing, she said, \"It's really me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look...good.\" hugging her, I said, \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my center of gravity is all off.\" Chuckling, she said, \"Not to mention the fact that my back is killing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" Taking her hand, I slowly guided her into the living room.  \"Have a seat on the couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter plopping down on the couch, she said, \"Thanks, sweetie.\" Looking at me, she said, \"How are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing pretty well; considering I was one of few not to swap with somebody.\" Sitting next to her, I said, \"Speaking of which; where's mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's out in the car; grabbing our things.\" Chuckling, she said, \"I would've helped; but I got tired simply getting out of the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe talked for a few minutes until mom came inside; during which time I learned that Dad's new name was Caitlyn Reilly and that she was pregnant with a boy.  I'd just gotten her a glass of water when Mom came into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing me, standing in the foyer, she said, \"Ashley, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, mom.\" Smiling, I said, \"It's really me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging me, Mom said, \"I'm so happy to see that you're alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I hugged mom, I started to wonder if Evan had been lying to me.</span></div></div>",

While mom went into the kitchen to start dinner; I sat down on the couch next to dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at...her, I said, \"I'm glad you and mom are alright, dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, sweetie.\" Pausing, Dad looked at me and said, \"I'm glad to see you weren't affected by this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found it amusing that I'd so far been able to trick not only Ashley's best friends; but also her parents into thinking that I was really her.  Looking at Dad, I said, \"Have you thought about...a new name?  I can't really call you dad now; since you're a 15 year old girl now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've decided to keep Caitlyn's name as my own.\" Sighing, Dad said, \"I'm in her body; it seems only fitting to have her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent the next few or so talking and watching movies; anything to get Caitlyn's mind off her situation.  One of the things we talked about was how the original Caitlyn had gotten pregnant in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently she'd had a one night stand with a classmate following a school dance.  Her parents had disowned her after they learned she was pregnant; they didn't take kindly to their 15 year old daughter being pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad...Caitlyn.\" pausing, I said, \"Where's the original Caitlyn now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's gone to check on her parents.\" Sighing, Caitlyn said, \"They may have disowned her; but she still cares for them and wants to see that they're alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed by uneventfully.  I enjoyed spending time with Mom and Caitlyn; especially since they were technically my parents now.  Things started to wind down around 8:15; with Caitlyn starting to feel tired.  Caitlyn originally wanted to sleep in bed with mom; but mom felt it would be too awkward.  So it was decided that Caitlyn would sleep in my bed while I slept in a sleeping bag.</span></div></div>",

That meant mom went out for groceries and to get a basic wardrobe for Caitlyn.  After getting her sizes; Mom's first stop was the maternity store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that time Allison and Erin came over to visit; wanting to get out of their houses for a while.  After the reintroductions had been made; we all settled in to watch a movie.  Allison and Erin were quickly adjusting to their new bodies; having spent most of yesterday swapping out their wardrobes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found Caitlyn's situation amusing; something which Caitlyn didn't agree with.  Caitlyn started to get a little grouchy, so I decided it was best if we relaxed by the pool.  After changing into my first bikini; I helped Caitlyn into a one piece that was big enough to cover her baby bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at herself in the mirror, Caitlyn said, \"I-I'm not sure about this, sweetie; I'm still not entirely comfortable with this body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, dad.\" Standing next to her, I said, \"It's only me and my friends; in our pool...you'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I helped Caitlyn downstairs; occasionally glancing over to see how she was doing.  The bathing suit wasn't the best fit; but it was good enough for now.  As we walked into the enclosed pool area, Allison said, \"Looking good, Mr. Sawyer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Caitlyn said, \"Thank you, Allison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before we were all in the pool; I was relieved to see that Caitlyn started to calm down the moment she got into the water.  Watching Caitlyn swim a lap in the pool, I said, \"How are you feeling, dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel pretty good, actually.\" Standing up in the shallow end, Caitlyn said, \"The water's doing wonders for my back.\"</span></div></div>",

After helping Caitlyn into her outfit; some pants and a top that mom had bought the day before, the two of us walked outside to...my car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt strange having to help my...dad dress like a girl; especially since I was still learning as well.  However, I was confident that I'd be able to learn and teach Caitlyn at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got to the mall a short time later; after decided to by Caitlyn a larger wardrobe.  With Allison and Erin preoccupied with their families; the two of us thought it was nice to spend time with just each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked through the mall, I wasn't surprised to see that there weren't many people around.  Caitlyn looked at me as we walked, saying, \"I'm not sure about this, sweetie; I'm still not used to being a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, daddy.\" Pausing, I said, \"You need a new wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent almost an hour buying clothes for Caitlyn; ranging from skirts to dresses and pants.  As we walked out of the last store, I spotted Tara Johnson and Tony Coletta walking into the mall.  Although I knew that Tara was in fact my...Evan's best friend Ryan; I found it hard to believe when I saw her wearing a skintight dress and 4 inch heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Caitlyn and I walked past them on the way to the food court, I heard <i>Tara</i> say, \"I don't want to be here, Tony.\" Sighing, she said, \"Why'd make me wear this ridiculous outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...babe.\" with a grin, Tony said, \"You're my girlfriend; and I want you to look the part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced as <i>Tara</i> was interrupted by Tony kissing her on the lips.  I watched as she tried to fight back; only to give in and start kissing back.  I started to wonder if Tony was forcing Ryan to act like Tara.</span></div></div>",

I was in the middle of eating a tuna grinder when I saw Tara get up and walked across to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I had to keep up appearances that I was really Ashley Sawyer; my concern for Ryan was too strong to resist.  Looking at Caitlyn, as she took a bite of her turkey grinder, I said, \"I'll be right back; I have to use the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into the bathroom just as <i>Tara</i> was walking out of a nearby stall; stumbling in her heels.  \"Stupid heels; why's Tony making me wear these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her, I said, \"Tara, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley?\" looking at me, she said, \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to go to the bathroom; same as you.\" Pausing, I said, \"Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not.\" Tearing up, <i>Tara</i> said, \"I'm not the real Tara! I'm Ryan Collins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" pretending to be shocked, I said, \"Why are you with Tony then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-He was there when Tara and I-I switched bodies; now he's forcing me to act like her, b-but the way he wanted her to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the real Tara?\" concerned, I said, \"Why didn't she do something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She abandoned me with Tony; running off the first chance she got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting angry with Tony, I said, \"Why are you letting him do this to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-He said he'd tell ev-everyone who I really was; i-if I don't do exactly what he says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me, Ryan.\" Taking her hand, I said, \"If you don't get away from him; he'll wear you down until he owns you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I suppose to do!?\" desperate, Ryan said, \"He'll tell everyone who I am if I go against him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tony tried that on his last girlfriend; but she got wise and dumped him.\" Pausing, I said, \"Talk to her; tell her the truth and see if she'll help get you away from Tony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I-I do until then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay with me.\" Pausing, I said, \"I'll get him to back off for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us exited the bathroom; with me supporting <i>Tara</i> as she walked in the heels.  As we rounded the corner, I saw Tony flirting with Caitlyn in the distance.  I was furious about that; only before I could do anything, she kicked him in the groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were close enough to hear Caitlyn talking to Tony as he lay on the floor.  \"Did you know a pregnant woman has increased adrenaline to protect her unborn child?  I suggest you look that up the next time you decide to flirt with one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tara</i> and I got there just as Tony was pulling himself off the floor.  Looking at her, he said, \"Come on, babe; let's get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, with a pleading look in her eyes, <i>Tara</i> said, \"Okay, Tony.\"</span></div></div>",

I had to remind myself that it was really Ryan in there; although I was finding that hard to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan?\" looking at her, I said, \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I came to talk.\" Pausing, Tara said, \"Can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled her inside and quickly closed the door; mostly because I had to maintain the idea that I was Ashley.  Prior to the Shift, Ashley wouldn't have been caught dead being seen with Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Looking at her, I said, \"What do you want to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have much time; Tony's asleep back at the apartment.\" Looking at me, she said, \"I wanted to tell you...more of how I ended up like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara went on to explain how, as Ryan, he'd tried to help Tara break up with Tony a few weeks earlier.  Before hooking up with Tony, Tara had been your average girl.  When Ryan found himself in Tara's body, Tony decided he wanted to get revenge on him for trying to get Tara to leave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Tara, I said, \"So he's forcing you to be his girlfriend out of revenge for something happened weeks ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Sighing, Tara said, \"I-I don't know how much longer I can last; he wants to have sex <i>every</i> night and I'm afraid I'll...start to enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n\"Did you get in touch with his ex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did.\" Pausing, Tara said, \"She's got a plan to help me leave Tony; but it's...complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shouldn't matter how complicated it is; as long as it ends with you free of Tony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy for you to say.\" Looking at me, Tara said, \"The plan involves me becoming...sluttier than I already am; Cassie wants me to flirt with every guy I see in an attempt to show Tony that I can't be controlled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why that's complicated.\" Looking at her, I said, \"But I don't think you've got much of a choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Sighing, Tara said, \"Doesn't make things any easier though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara left a short time later; wanting to get home before Tony woke up.  I was walking into my room when the phone rang.  Looking at it, I saw that it was Caitlyn's cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the phone, I said, \"Caitlyn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could hear sobbing on the other end; as Caitlyn said, \"Ash-Ashley, yo-you have to come pick m-me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't need to be told twice, as I hung up and grabbed my things.  I was out the door a few minutes later; wondering what got Caitlyn so upset.</span></div></div>",

It took me 20 minutes but I finally arrived outside the office where Caitlyn worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParking the car, I was about to walk into the building when I heard sobbing coming from around the corner.  Following the sound, I rounded the corner to find Caitlyn sitting against a nearby wall with tears streaming down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caitlyn?\" walking over to her, I said, \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Caitlyn got up and buried herself in my arms.  I held her for a few minutes as she cried; until she calmed down enough to look at me.  \"I-I can't work here anymore, Ashley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" confused, I said, \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My co-workers were all teasing me about the fact that I'm a pregnant girl now.\" Sobbing, Caitlyn said, \"They all swapped with someone their age; I'm the only one who swapped with a kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly walked Caitlyn towards the car; wiping the dirt off her skirt suit as we went along.  As I helped her into the car, I said, \"Why would they do that?  They all swapped; they should understand what you're dealing with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I told them.  But,\" pausing, Caitlyn said, \"They said that neither they nor my clients would be able to take me seriously now; I went from being a grown man to a girl who's going to have a baby in a few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got in the car, I said, \"What are you going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Ashley.\" Wiping the tears from her eyes, Caitlyn said, \"I just want to go home and forget about today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI called mom on the way home to tell her what happened; all she said was that the family would be having an important discussion when she got home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>*****Author's Note - This restarts the thread back to the point where the shift occurs.*****</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing I remembered before everything went black was listening to Mr. Tomlin math lecture.  The next thing I know, I am sitting at a table in the library.  As I looked around, I realized the entire room was in a panic; with people screaming at each other or cowering under the tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked around some more, my gaze was drawn to a purse lying on the ground at my feet.  Leaning down to grab it, I suddenly fell forward and hit my face on the floor.  Sitting up, I was beginning to wonder why I had fallen when I looked down and saw a pair of breasts poking out from a somewhat revealing top.  \u201cWhat the hell is...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped speaking the moment I heard the voice coming out of my mouth; it definitely was not mine.  Feeling the need to find out what was going on; I carefully got to my feet.  Some subconscious urge caused me to grab the purse from the table.  I started walking towards the exit, stumbling every few feet because I was now wearing boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out of the library, I made my way to the nearest bathroom; avoiding the panicking kids and adults as I went.  Walking into the boy\u2019s bathroom, I went over to the mirror and was shocked by the reflection I saw before me.  It was that of an attractive girl with dark blonde hair; she was wearing a skirt and matching top.  I immediately recognized the girl as Ashley Johnson; one of the most popular girls in the 10th grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone at school knew about Ashley; she was the only child of a middle-aged couple.  Her father was a businessman and her mom was a professor at the local college.  Being that she was the only child, she was very spoiled and always seemed to get her way.  Along with her friends Lisa Martin and Joyce Collins, she was one of the popular girls that every boy wanted to date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly realized that this was not a dream; that I\u2019d really become a 16-year-old girl.  Once I realized I was no longer in my body, I had to figure out what to do next.  I left the bathroom a moment later; only vaguely aware of the fact that I was walking perfectly fine in the boots now.  As I walked down the hall, I decided my next course of action would be to find Corinne and get us both home safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wandered the halls for what seemed like hours; coming across people in various stages of distress.  After a while, I\u2019d yet to find Corinne, but I hadn\u2019t found my body either.  I had to wonder where Ashley was; I'd seen no sign of my body and no one had run up to me claiming I was in their body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before I found Corinne poking her head out of a nearby stairwell.  Running towards her, I yelled, \u201cCorinne!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing me, Corinne looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m not Corinne; I\u2019m Eric Rogers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was a kid in Corinne\u2019s grade; he was kind of a nerd.  Looking at him, I said, \u201cEric, I have to find Corinne.  Where were you when this happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was at home with the flu.\u201d  Pausing, looking at his now female body, Eric said, \u201cWho\u2019d have thought that having the flu would be the worst to happen to me this year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet someplace safe, Eric; people are starting to freak out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you so concerned about Corinne, Ashley?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurred to me that I had not told Eric who I really was.  Looking at him, I said, \u201cWith everything that\u2019s going on, I\u2019d hate for anyone to get hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Pausing, Eric said, \u201cI-I\u2019ll go to her house; I found her keys in her purse and she doesn\u2019t live that far from here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric proved to be a dead end; as he lived on the other side of town.  As I resigned myself to the fact that I would not get to Corinne anytime soon, I began to wonder what I was going to do.  Here I was in a girl\u2019s body amidst a world of chaos; I started to worry for my safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I made my way to the front of the building, I began to think of my next course of action.  The logical thing to do was to go to my house, but it was 20 minutes away from here and I would be even less safe out there then I was in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not sure why I ultimately decided not to go home; I mean Eric thought to go to my place, but for some reason, I felt like I should not go there.  After a few moments of indecision, I decided that going to Ashley\u2019s place was the best bet.  She lived in a gated subdivision about 10 minutes from here; I figured that would give me some protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked down the street, I saw all sorts of chaos; car crashes, buildings on fire and people running around in a panic.  Thankfully, no one seemed to pay attention to me.  I arrived at Ashley\u2019s subdivision a few minutes later; walking through the remains of the front gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing screaming and explosions in the distance, I ran the rest of the way to Ashley\u2019s house.  With Ashley\u2019s parents out of town, I figured no one would have a problem with me spending the night.  Arriving at the front door, I dug through Ashley\u2019s purse and found her keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter letting myself into the house, I quickly closed and locked the door.  Placing Ashley\u2019s purse on a nearby table, I walked into the family room.  Ashley was known for thrown parties at her house when her parents weren\u2019t around, but since I was considered unpopular I  never received an invitation.  I would never have thought my first time in her house would be when I was in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the family room, I was mildly surprised by how modest it was.  There was a high-end TV on the wall but it looked about 45 inches.  On a shelf next to the TV, I saw pictures of Ashley at various ages.  Seeing her vacation photos, I started to get jealous of her.  I had a crappy home life, my mom worked just enough to provide for my family and I hadn\u2019t been on a vacation in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut looking at the photos, I could see Ashley having the time of her life in places like the Bahamas or skiing in the mountains.  I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how such a spoiled brat got everything when I had nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the kitchen, feeling thirsty, I grabbed a water bottle from the fridge.  Exploring the house a little more, I eventually found Ashley\u2019s room.  It seemed this was where her parents spent most of their money; she had a 40\u201d TV on the wall and a closet full of what looked to be expensive clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down on the bed, which proved to be very comfortable, as I heard explosions and screams in the distance.  As I heard those, I realized that I was now in a girl\u2019s body; I had to make sure that I wasn\u2019t in harm's way.  After running to ensure that all the windows and doors were locked, I went back up to Ashley\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying on the bed, in a way that didn\u2019t involve lying on my breasts, I closed my eyes and fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

Going downstairs to retrieve Ashley\u2019s cell phone from her purse, I called my house to see if anyone was there. After several rings, all I got was the voicemail.  I was about to leave a message when the call suddenly dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the phone, I saw that I no longer had any service; didn\u2019t take long to realize a cell tower must have been hit.  Just then there was a large explosion nearby; followed by screaming.  I stood in the foyer, starting to freak out when I heard loud knocking on the front door.  Letting out a girlish scream, I went to the window to see what was going on.  I was somewhat surprised to see Lisa and Joyce standing on the porch; looking startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, I said, \u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to contact you for hours, but the cell service totally sucks with all that\u2019s happening.\u201d Looking at me, Lisa said, \u201cWe hid in a vacant room at the school until things quieted down; we came here because it was closer to school than our houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, get inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were all inside, Joyce looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re safe, Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter locking the door, I turned to Joyce and said, \u201cI\u2019m not really Ashley, I-I\u2019m Evan Thompson.\u201d</span></div></div>",

So I think the best bet would be to stay here where it\u2019s safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree with Lisa.\u201d Looking at me, Joyce said, \u201cDon\u2019t think this means you\u2019re suddenly our friend or anything; once this is fixed, we\u2019re back to shunning you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we\u2019d all come to an agreement, the three of us sat down on the couch and watched the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of watching the news, about what they were now calling the Great Shift, Lisa got up from the couch.  \u201cI don\u2019t know about you two, but I\u2019m getting hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cWhen I was looking around earlier, I saw a container of pulled pork in the fridge; maybe we could have that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally I wouldn\u2019t eat that because of my figure.  But,\u201d sighing, Joyce said, \u201cI guess I don\u2019t have much choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Lisa said, \u201cEvan, why don\u2019t you help me in the kitchen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, I followed Lisa into the kitchen.  \u201cWhy do you need my help?  The container isn\u2019t that heavy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Turning to look at me, Lisa said, \u201cI just wanted to talk to you without Joyce in the room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTalk to me?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cAbout what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I came across a little bitchy earlier.  I guess I let my emotions get the better of me; I didn\u2019t really care about how you were affected by all this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay; I totally understand why you acted the way you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest, I only really acted that way because Joyce did.  She can be a bit of a bitch at times.\u201d Sighing, Lisa said, \u201cYou know how it is with peer pressure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually I don\u2019t, but I get your point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I wanted to apologize for making you uncomfortable.\u201d Looking at me, Lisa said, \u201cI\u2019m willing to help you deal with being a girl until this is reversed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grabbing what we\u2019d need for food, I followed Lisa back into the family room.  Looking at us, Joyce said, \u201cWhat kept you guys?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe were just talking.\u201dk</span></div></div>",

As I sat there, I was momentarily confused by the long hair in front of my eyes; until I\u2019d remembered the events of the day before.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I thought about taking Ashley's life for my own for a while. Compared to my old life, hers was much more easy going and her parents gave her anything she wanted, whenever she wanted it. My mother never gives me anything. She makes me work for it. When I wanted a phone, she made me do chores until I saved the money to buy it myself. But Ashley, I could here her barging about her new phone every 3rd month. Just then I was interrupted by a knock at the door. I peeked out the window and saw my old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" I told myself. \"That's probably Ashely coming to take back her life\" I went and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even, is that you?\" Ashely asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, it's me. I thought you would come here sooner or later\" I lied. \"I thought we should talk about what were going to do about this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" she started. \"Sense your sister is in one of your friends body's, she's taking your clothes, which I'm fine with. I'll just get some new ones. You mom is in your sisters body so she plans on using her clothes. So I thought I'd help you pack my clothes and we could take them to your house. This way you don't have to share with your mom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" I asked. \"I took a look in your closet and there is too much for just us to carry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.  We can take my daddy's SUV. It should fit all of my clothes\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, we started packing her clothes into boxes. I was surprised with how long it took us. I looked at the clock before we  started packing and it read 7:30 pm. When we had finished it was 9:43. I thought about weather I wanted her clothes as we packed everything into the SUV. Almost all her tops looked so tight and reveling and most of her bottoms were skirts. She had plenty of jeans to, but they were all skinny jeans. And then there were the shoes. It looked like almost every pair had some sort of heel to it. And the few that didn't were the gym shoes she would wear when she decided she would actually go to gym class. I think she was in my gym class, but she had only been there like once or twice this year, so they were almost all in perfect condition. There were like five pairs of gym shoes, but they were all girly colors like pink and purple. She still had all the boxes for her shoes, so we put them in the correct box that it came in originally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter packing all of Ashley's clothing into the boxes, I realized that the heeled boots she had been wearing when the shift happened were starting to hurt my feet. I sat on Ashley's bed and took them off. Then I grabbed a pair of her gym shoes. They were black and purple. Just as I pulled them out I herd Ashley say \"Hell no\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I asked, confused as to why I couldn't wear the shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those shoes don't go with that outfit\" she informed me. She then went to one of the boxes of clothes and pulled something out. \"Here, wear these. While I will let you develop your own fashion seance later, right now you still have to look good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at what she handed me. On top was a white short sleeve under armer tech shirt. Then some black yoga pants that didn't have a makers label anywhere I could see. Lastly she handed me a grey under armed hoody with some purple by the shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put these on\" she told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" I said taking the clothes and turning to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about the bathroom. You have my body, I've seen it naked thousands of times\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about it before realizing she was right. I striped down to my underwear and put on the pants first. I looked over at Ashley and saw she was hard. \"I see you like the view\" I jokingly said. She hadn't realized what I was talking about until she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has a mind of its own\" she said. She sounded a little scared that she was attracted to her old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's just the body\" I told her. \"Hey this might sound a little weird, but could you cut my hair a little shorter before we leave. It just feels weird by my waist\" I asked as I finished getting changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, how long do you want it?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we cut it to say, my shoulder blades\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\" she said. She took me to the kitchen and sat me down. She then brushed my hair, got some scissors and started to cut my hair. She cut it just below my shoulder blades. She handed me a hand mirror and, I must say, I looked HOT. If I was still a guy, I would totally be hard right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that my old body looks better with shorter hair. I can't believe I never thought about it\" Ashley said admiring her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe finished packing Ashley's clothes into her dad's SUV. I was surprise everything fit. We then made the thirty minute drive to my house on the other side of town. We talked almost the whole ride there. We talked about school, our friends and family. Ashely talked mostly and I just listened to her. I was trying to figure out what life would be like now. My mom now looks like my sister. My sister looks like my best friend. I brushed some of my new long brown hair out of my face and looked out the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley noticed the look on my face. \"I'm worried to. It's not every day you end up in someone else's body\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just that\" I started. \"I'm just scared. I mean, I don't know the first thing about being a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Your mom offered to let me stay with your family until my parents come home and we can all help you adjust to your new situation. And I want to help you through this transition so you can help me\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrived at my house and I saw my sister and my best friend Ryan. I had to remind myself that Corinne was really my mother and Ryan was really Corinne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's my \"sister\" Corinne said, putting emphasis on sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, how's my \"brother\" I asked in the same tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not make fun at our situations ok\" my mom said. \"This is very serious. Let's start unpacking Evans new clothes and put them in his room. Just so you know Evan, we moved all of your clothing to Corinne's room, and all of Corinne's clothes to my room. Ashley, you can sleep in the guest room or Corinne's room, whichever you prefer until your parents show up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like thanks a ton Mrs. Reed. I just like don't feel conferrable being home alone right now. You never know if someone is how they say they are\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. How will your parents know to call here?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we left my house, I changed the answering machine. If anybody calls it will tell them to call my cellphone. My parents have my number memorized, so they will call when they are able to\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was really funny to here my best talking like my sister would and my sister talking like my mom. And my old body, talked like a teenage girl. And now, I sounded like a teenage girl whenever I talked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe worked hard to get all of Ashley's old clothes (my new ones) in my closet. There was barley enough room in my closet. Then the under-where in the dresser. Then we stacked the boxes of shoes along the wall. Everyone left to go and watch some tv while I sat on my bed and looked at my room. It looked so different now, with the closet filled with clothes and shoes that are considered fashionable in the closet and along the wall. I took a moment to let it sink in. I ran my hand through my hair. Then I stood up and grabbed some sweatpants from my closet that had our school name running down the left leg. I removed the the yoga pants and sweatshirt and then put on the sweatpants. While the yoga pants weren't restricting at all, the sweatpants were conferrable and I could sleep in them if I wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went downstairs and found everyone in the living room watching the news. \"Anything new\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Ashley said. \"They don't know who did this, why it happened, or if it's reversible\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we try and take our minds off things and watch a movie\" Corinne said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good idea as any\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about, Grown ups?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" said Ashley. \"It's been a while sense I've seen that\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorinne popped in the movie and sat on the recliner chair. Mom sat on the floor next to Corinne, and I plopped next to Ashley on the couch. As we watched the movie and laughed and had a good time, Ashely and I slowly drifted closer and closer until she had fallen asleep on my shoulder just before the end of the movie. When the credits started, I shook her awake.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You should probably go to bed\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your pro...bably right\" she said as she yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should all go to bed\" my mom said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly walked up to my bathroom, opened up a new toothbrush, and brushed my teeth. As I finished, Ashley came in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom said I could share with you\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, you want to use a new toothbrush or do you want the one I used before this all happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pitch the old one\" she said. \"Oh hey, before you go to bed, I thought I'd teach you something simple that you can do to make getting ready in the morning easier\". She pulled a black hair tie from her pocket. \"I've found your hair is a little neater in the morning if you pull it into a ponytail. You need my help?\" She asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take all the help I can get\" I said. With that she showed me how to put my hair into a ponytail. With that, I said goodnight to Ashely and went to bed.</span></div></div>",

After I closed the door, I placed Ashley\u2019s purse on a nearby table and decided to walk around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley\u2019s house was well known at school for being the location of many parties over the years; but since I was considered one of the unpopular kids, I was never invited.  Who would have thought the first time I\u2019d see the inside of her house would be when I was in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the family room, I glanced at a large 60\u2019 TV mounted on the wall.  It wasn\u2019t long before I found several photos of Ashley and her parents; from when she was a little girl all the way to the present.  Seeing some of their vacation photos, I was jealous of the fact that her family was able to go on such nice vacations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean there was even a photo of her overlooking the Grand Canyon.  Things had been rough for my family ever since my dad left; so <br>\r\nI couldn't help but feel a pang of jealously over seeing Ashley and her family happy.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair; she\u2019s one of the most stuck up girls I\u2019ve ever met and she gets to experience all of this fun adventures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking upstairs, it didn\u2019t take long to find Ashley\u2019s room.  Looking around I saw many expensive items; a 40\u2019 TV on the wall and a walk in closet full of what looked to be very pricey clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat down on Ashley\u2019s bed, I found my hatred of her growing by the second.  She was such a spoiled brat; she didn\u2019t deserve anything her parents gave her.  Granted my life wasn\u2019t terrible; but it was nothing compared to hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying down on the bed, I heard what sounded like explosions in the distance.  As I closed my eyes for a bit, I wondered what my next course of action was going to be.</span></div></div>",

Sitting up, I was momentarily confused as to why I was in a girl\u2019s room until I remembered what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith more explosions in the distance, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what was going on outside and if my family was safe.  Going downstairs to retrieve Ashley\u2019s cellphone from her purse, I called my house to see if anyone was there.  After several rings, all I got was the voicemail.  I was about to leave a message when the call suddenly dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the phone, I saw that I no longer had any service; didn\u2019t take long to realize a cell tower must have been hit.  Just then there was a large explosion nearby; followed by screaming.  It suddenly dawned on me that I was now a teenage girl; if someone got into this house and found me, I would have a hard time defending myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure the door was locked, I ran upstairs to Ashley\u2019s bedroom and closed the door.  After ensuring the blinds were closed and the door to Ashley\u2019s porch was locked, I sat down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stayed like that for what seemed like an eternity; until I figured it would not be helpful to cower in fear.  Getting up, I decided once again to look around Ashley\u2019s room; since it seemed like it was going to be mine for the time being.  Walking into her closet, I saw that her close were indeed very pricey; which didn\u2019t surprise me one bit.  Ashley was known to be a very fashionable girl; and she would not be caught dead in cheap clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the closet, I passed a full-length mirror and caught a glimpse of Ashley\u2019s reflection in it.  Turning to look at the mirror, it finally dawned on me that I was in the body of the most popular girl in school.  Everyone, even the unpopular kids like me, considered Ashley to be very attractive.  Looking at her reflection, I could see why everyone thought that; she had an almost perfect body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for me to realize that I was now inhabiting this body; which meant I was now the most attractive girl in school.  I couldn\u2019t help but feel weirded out by the idea of boys finding me attractive; I was however surprised to find myself somewhat turned on by the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking those thoughts from my head, I realized that I was getting hungry.  Walking downstairs to the kitchen, I spent the next 15 minutes making myself a quick dinner before heading into the family room to watch TV.  Turning on the TV, I wasn\u2019t surprised to find that the only thing on TV was live coverage of what people were calling the \u201cGreat Shift.\u201d No one seemed to know what caused them or how to reverse them; which meant I was probably going to be like this for the foreseeable future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while I got bored of watching the news, so I decided to watch a DVD inside.  As I watched the movie, a strange idea occurred to me.  I found myself thinking how nice Ashley\u2019s life was compared to mine; she was popular, her parents were still together and they seemed to have a fair amount of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the couch, as the movie played in the background, I was surprised to find myself actually considering stealing Ashley\u2019s life and pretending to be her.  Getting up to put the dishes away from my dinner, I walked passed a mirror in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but look at it; realizing that I could easily pretend to be Ashley, since the news said there was a small portion of the population who weren\u2019t affected.  Of course that would all hinge on the hope that the real Ashley didn\u2019t blow my cover.  Looking down at my body, I realized it would be nice to be considered popular and attractive; although being a girl would take some getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m doing this then.\u201d  Placing my hands on my waist, as I had seen the real Ashley do often, I said, \u201cI guess its goodbye Evan Johnson; say hello to the new Ashley Sawyer.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After putting the dishes away, having gotten bored of the movie, I walked upstairs to what was now my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell since this is my life now, I guess I should educate myself a little.\u201d  Closing the door, I said to myself, \u201cPeople might be suspicious if I suddenly forget some major part of Ashley\u2019s life; or forget names of family members.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take me long to find where Ashley kept her diaries.

Once I\u2019d finished on the toilet, I walked back into the bedroom and sat down on the bed.  <br>\r\nLooking at the clock, I saw that it was almost 8:00; with nothing better to do, I figured it was time to go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that it was now my body, I still felt a little anxious about seeing it naked.  It did not take long, thankfully, for me to overcome the anxiety and change into a pair of flannel pajama pants and a tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning off the lights and closing the blinds, I climbed into bed and closed my eyes; wondering what tomorrow would bring.</span></div></div>",

Getting out of bed, I walked to the bathroom to relieve myself; immediately noticing that I had a bad case of bed hair.  As much as I wanted to avoid that for the time being, I knew the best way to fix this was to take a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately after entering the shower, I was overwhelmed by new sensations as the water hit my newly sensitive skin.  I chose to avoid washing around my chest because I knew that would be too much.  Eventually I finished in the shower and got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drying myself off, I remembered what Corinne did with her hair in the morning.  I quickly found a hairdryer and went to work.  It was not long before my hair was presentable; at least enough that I could go outside if I wanted to.  As I walked back to the bedroom, it dawned on me that I was suddenly becoming worried about my appearance when going outside.  I wondered if I was gaining some of Ashley\u2019s mannerisms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith school canceled for the near future, I didn\u2019t have anything to do today.  With that in mind, I settled on a causal outfit to wear; consisting of a pair of Capri pants and a top.  Once I was satisfied, I decided to continue reading Ashley\u2019s diaries for information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later, I was reading a recent entry about a date Ashley had with the captain of the football team.  I wondered if I had to keep dating him to keep up appearances; I did not even know if he was still in his own body.  Just as I was about to get a new diary to read, I heard the doorbell.  I froze briefly as I wondered if it was Ashley returning home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the diary down, I went downstairs to see who it was.  Peeking through the window, I was surprised to not only see Aaron, Ashley\u2019s boyfriend but also Corinne.  Putting on my best Ashley face, I opened the door and said, \u201cAaron, Corinne; like what are you two doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, it\u2019s like bad enough that I\u2019m in this losers body; now I have people actually thinking that I\u2019m her.\u201d Pausing, \u2018Corinne\u2019 turned to me and said, \u201cIt\u2019s me, Allison; I got shifted into the body of that Corinne Thompson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all my strength not to lash out at Allison for saying that about my sister\u2019s body; because I knew that would definitely give me away.  Looking from me to Allison, in a feminine tone, \u2018Kevin\u2019 said, \u201cAt least you guys are still girls; it\u2019s like totally weird being a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErin, is that you?\u201d making sure to stay in character, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re totally in my boyfriend\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently that wasn\u2019t something to be discussed; as Allison turned to me and said, \u201cDon\u2019t bring that up; she\u2019s weirded out by that you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked passed them, relieved that they seemed to believe that I was Ashley, and noticed an approaching storm.  \u201cCome on inside, guys; there\u2019s a storm coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the living room, Allison and I watched as Erin struggled find a comfortable seating position.  \u201cYou guys think this is so funny, don\u2019t you.\u201d  Seeing the grins on our faces, Erin said, \u201cHow would you guys feel if you were suddenly turned into a boy; and I made fun of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t like it one bit.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cSorry; we\u2019ll work on that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat down, I noticed Erin briefly glancing at my cleavage.  Ignoring that for a moment, I said, \u201cSo what are you guys doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell with the phones down, and the power out in parts of the city, we wanted to see if you were alright.\u201d Glancing at Erin, Allison said, \u201cEven Erin agreed that walking here as a football player was a good idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo like what happened after the Shift; where\u2019d you guys go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe stayed at my house, since it was closer to school.\u201d Sighing, Erin said, \u201cMy parents were shifted with the newlywed couple down the street; I guess I\u2019m going to be a big brother soon, because my dad is now 6 months pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sucks for him.\u201d Turning to Allison, I said, \u201cHow about your folks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t affected at all; which is like so weird.\u201d Pausing, Allison said, \u201cI guess only like 10% of the world was unaffected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I was one of the lucky ones then.\u201d Leaning back, unaware that I was giving Erin an even better look at my breasts, I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from my parents at all; I hope they\u2019re alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably fine; but just can\u2019t get in touch just yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued talking for a while; I was confident that I was successfully fooling them into thinking I was Ashley.

After that came the part where they taught me a bit of girl\u2019s fashion; what clothes I should and shouldn\u2019t wear as well as what shoes went with what outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay guys, I think I\u2019ve had enough lessons for one day.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cWith all this stuff about makeup and hair, I\u2019m trying to remind myself that I used to be a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a boy anymore, Evan; that ended the moment you decided to take Ashley\u2019s place.\u201d Looking at me, Allison said, \u201cNow Erin and I are going downstairs to see what we can do for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll meet you downstairs once I get dressed.\u201d Getting up, I said, \u201cOne thing though; I have to know what gave it away that I wasn\u2019t Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you said you had a sausage pizza last night.\u201d Turning to me, Erin sad, \u201cAshley\u2019s been a vegetarian since the 7th grade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s why I was on the toilet for a bit last night; this body isn\u2019t used to that food anymore.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll be down shortly to show you what I\u2019ve learned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a while to make a decision; but I finally settled on a cute tennis outfit that Allison said Ashley had just bought.  After putting it on, I could not help but admire the way it hugged my new figure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I\u2019d selected a pair of matching shoes, I sat down at the vanity to do my hair and makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was all finished, I stood in front of the mirror and admired my handy work; having trouble seeing anything that said I used to be a boy.  \u201cDamn, I\u2019m one good looking girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking downstairs, I heard Erin and Allison talking in the kitchen.  <br>\r\nAs I got closer, I heard Erin said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I can stand being around Evan for another second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy; because he lied to us and pretended to be Ashley?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of it.\u201d Pausing, Erin said, \u201cThe biggest part is the way my body is acting when he\u2019s around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to break up with me, Erin; just say so.\u201d Walking into the kitchen, I said, \u201cThere are plenty of boys, and girls, who would love to date a girl like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Allison and Erin looked at me with shocked expressions on their faces.  Allison was the first to speak; walking over to me as she said, <br>\r\n\u201cWow; I guess you weren\u2019t kidding when you said you were a quick learner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are advantages to being a nerd.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cAlthough I can see many more advantages to being one of the most popular girls in school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Erin said, \u201cYou look pretty good, Evan; I have to say you picked out a really nice outfit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you think I look than pretty good.\u201d Gesturing to Erin\u2019s crotch, I said, \u201cI think you like what you see very much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind not teasing me about that constantly?\u201d blushing, Erin said, \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that I want nothing more than to kiss you; I don\u2019t need you two teasing me about it every chance you get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine; we\u2019ll stop teasing you.\u201d Giggling, I turned to Allison and said, \u201cSo whats for dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Pausing, Allison said, \u201cThe three of us were watching our figures for cheerleading; but I guess Erin doesn\u2019t have to worry about that anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at us, Erin said, \u201cHow about we just have whatever leftovers are in the fridge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that works.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Erin and Allison continued their lessons to teach me how to behave like Ashley; they were once again impressed with how quickly I had gotten her mannerisms down.  I told them it helped that I had known Ashley for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 3 days they were confident that I could fool everyone, including my new parents, into thinking I really was Ashley.  Once that was accomplished, the three of us didn\u2019t have anything else to do; so I figured I would help Erin get used to being a boy.  That proved somewhat challenging due to her resistance and the fact that my body was attracted to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing I did was teach her to talk more manly; because it would make things easier for her in the long run.  Thankfully my new father\u2019s clothes fit Erin; so that wasn\u2019t going to be a problem.  Allison was another problem entirely; she resented the fact that she was now in the unattractive body of my sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been four days since the Shift; while Erin was on the phone trying to get in touch with her family to tell them that we were all safe, I found myself working as a counselor for Allison.  I found her crying in my closet; curled up underneath my clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to her, I knelt down and said, \u201cAlly, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair, Ev...Ash.\u201d looking at me, tears in her eyes, Allison said, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I have gotten your body instead of this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it was like random or something.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cAt least you\u2019re still a girl; Erin and I are dealing with being different genders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s true.\u201d Sitting up, Allison said, \u201cIt\u2019s just that I worked so hard to make my...old body look good; and it was all for nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that; you could easily remake Corinne\u2019s body into a more attractive one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want anyone insulting your sister\u2019s body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not my sister anymore; and I guess I\u2019m slipping into the role of Ashley a little easier than expected.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cIf you could teach me to act like Ashley in three days, I don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t improve your new body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d Smiling, wiping the tears from her face, Allison said, \u201cDo you mind if I wear some of your clothes; she may be a plain girl but Corinne\u2019s the same size as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, go right ahead.\u201d Getting up, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be downstairs with Erin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do anything funny, you two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking downstairs a few minutes later, I saw Erin walking out of the kitchen with the phone.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvan...I mean Ash, it\u2019s your father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into character, I grabbed the phone and said, \u201cDaddy, is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi princess, it\u2019s me.\u201d A woman\u2019s voice answered. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you weren\u2019t affected by this; but as you can see I\u2019ve switched bodies with your mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you guys called?\u201d surprised by how emotional I was getting, I said, \u201cYou really scared me, daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, princess; but cell service was just restored by us.\u201d Pausing, Ashley\u2019s dad said, \u201cAre you doing alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m doing fine; I\u2019m here with Allison and Erin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you girls going outside unless you have to, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay daddy, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood; we\u2019ll try to be home in a few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I hung up the phone, a shocked look on her face, Erin turned to me and said, \u201cWow, you really sounded like Ashley just now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Shrugging, I said, \u201cAt least it was good enough to fool her parents.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After my talk with my new parents, I had to admit I was surprised when Allison came downstairs all dressed up.  I could not believe that it was Corinne\u2019s body I was seeing all dressed up.  Allison really did a great job making it look attractive, especially since Corinne had been known to dress plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, it was a sunny day and I for one was getting tired of being cooped up in the house all the time.  I was standing in front of the mirror in my room, modeling some outfits, when Erin walked into the room.  \u201cHey Ash, I was...whoa, wh-what are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeveloping my sense of fashion, like Ally and you suggested.\u201d Turning to Erin, wearing a little black dress, I said, \u201cHow do I look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look...great; that dress really shows off your figure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying that because you\u2019re still a fashionable girl inside the boy\u2019s body?\u201d with a giggle, I said, \u201cOr is it because you <i>enjoy</i> what you see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t make this more embarrassing then it already is; it\u2019s bad enough that I\u2019m attracted to you in this body.\u201d Sighing, nervously, Erin said, \u201cI-I don\u2019t need you reminding me about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you think I feel?\u201d looking at Erin, I said, \u201cThis body goes crazy every time we\u2019re in the same room; it was all I could do last night not to pounce on you when you got out of the shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we\u2019re both dealing with changing sexual orientations; I guess that's normal under the circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you suggest we do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I want a relationship with you; but...if you\u2019re okay with it, I would like to at least kiss you to see what it\u2019s like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine by me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to admit, as I edged closer to Erin, that I felt a little nervous.  This wasn\u2019t exactly how I\u2019d pictured my first kiss; with a boy who constantly ridiculed me at school while I was in a girl\u2019s body.  With brief hesitation, I closed my eyes and touched my lips to Erin\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stood there for a second, neither of sure what to do; until Erin started to kiss me back.  Enjoying the feeling that came with this, I reciprocated and we started making out in my bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe did that for what seemed like an eternity until Allison walked in on us.  \u201cOh God; I didn\u2019t need to see that.\u201d As we broke the kiss, Allison said, \u201cGeez Erin, I told you to ask Ashley if she wanted to hangout by the pool; not make out with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Ally.\u201d Blushing, adjusting my dress, I said, \u201cIt was a spur of the moment thing; w-we wanted to see what it was like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d Sighing, Allison said, \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m borrowing one of your bikinis; if you guys want to join me, go right ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Allison left with one of my bikinis, I turned to Erin and said, \u201cSo, uh, what did you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was...nice.\u201d blushing, Erin said, \u201cI can see why Ashley...you are so popular with the boys; you\u2019re a good kisser.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cIf you want; maybe after things settle down we could...have a date?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019d like that.\u201d Smiling, Erin said, \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m going to grab one of your dad\u2019s swimsuits; I\u2019ll meet you downstairs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was looking through my dresser a few minutes later when Allison walked in, wearing a nice bikini that showed off Corinne\u2019s figure.  <br>\r\nLooking at me, she said, \u201cI have to say, I\u2019m surprised you guys waited as long as you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cIt was just a casual kiss between friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so that\u2019s what that was.\u201d Looking at me, with a smile, Allison said, \u201cBecause I swear I saw Erin\u2019s hands slowly moving down your waist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want me to say, Ally?\u201d grabbing a bikini that I liked, I said, \u201cDo you want me to admit that I\u2019ve got Ashley\u2019s interest in boys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to admit it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine, I like boys now.\u201d Walking towards Allison, bathing suit in hand, I said, \u201cErin\u2019s body makes me crazy; if you hadn\u2019t walked in, I don\u2019t think kissing would be the extent of what we did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to hear you admit it.\u201d Grinning, Allison said, \u201cNow get changed; the sun\u2019s out and I figure we could work on our tans.\u201d</span></div></div>",

We were so engrossed in our discussion that I barely heard the sound of a car door closing.  A few minutes later, I heard a woman\u2019s voice say, <br>\r\n\u201cSomething\u2019s never change.\u201d With a pausing, the woman said, \u201cThe entire world was just turned upside down; and our daughter is working on her tan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the direction of the voice, I saw an older man and woman standing in the doorway to the kitchen.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few days proved interesting; as I not only continued to adjust to being Ashley, but also adjusting to having her parents around.  Erin and Allison had been okay with my occasional slip up, but I didn\u2019t want to slip up around Ashley\u2019s parents.  I also had to get used to calling them \u2018my\u2019 parents; because I was now technically their daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder that guise, I helped my mom teach my dad about how to dress and act like a woman.  He was hesitant at first; because he was hoping all this was temporary.  After a while we managed to convince him that if it wasn\u2019t permanent, he would have to learn all this anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 9:00 in the morning on a Thursday; just over a week since the Shift occurred.  I woke up to an alert on my cell phone; looking at it, I saw it was a text with Allison.  It read \u201cWe\u2019ll be there at 10:00; make sure you\u2019re ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust getting up; I\u2019ll start getting ready now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing out of bed, I remembered today was the day the local school district was having a meet and greet at all the schools in the district.  This way they could re-register everyone that shifted; while allowing them to see their friends.  I did not have to re-register of course, but Allison and Erin did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the next 20 minutes in the shower; shaving my legs and all that fun stuff.  Ashley always amazing when she was at school; I knew people would know something was wrong if I came to school with hairy legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting out of the shower, and drying, I walked to my room to get dressed.  Having gotten the hang of picking out outfits, I found a nice skirt/top combo that I thought looked nice.  Once that was done, I did my hair and makeup and went downstairs with my <br>\r\npurse and shoes in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy parents were awake at that point; both of them in the kitchen having breakfast.  As I walked in, I saw my dad wearing what seemed to be one of my mom\u2019s robes as he cooked breakfast on the stove.  My mom was sitting at the table drinking coffee and reading a week old newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to wonder if this was how life had been before the Shift; Ashley\u2019s dad cooked while Ashley\u2019s mom sat around.  Pushing those thoughts aside, I walked over and kissed my dad on the cheek.  \u201cMorning, daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning princess.\u201d Smiling, dad said, \u201cWhere are you going in such a hurry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe school is re-registering everybody; even those that didn\u2019t get shifted.\u201d Grabbing an orange, I said, \u201cAllison and Erin are picking me up in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay safe out there, honey.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, \u201cThere\u2019s people out there that might try and hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, mom.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you noticed; but Erin\u2019s like really big and strong now, she\u2019ll protect us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, I heard the honking of a car horn.  After saying good bye, I ran outside.</span></div></div>",

I didn\u2019t have to wait very long; because she was next in <br>\r\nline.  I had to struggle to hear but, when she was asked her name, I was shocked to hear her say Ryan Anderson.  I stood in line, shocked, as I heard that.  \u201cOh my god; Ryan\u2019s now the sluttiest girl in school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t have long to dwell on that; because it was soon my turn.

I didn't have time to dwell on that; although I relieved to see that no one else ended up with her body.  Soon enough it was my turn; I walked up and said that I was still Ashley Sawyer.

Following after her, I walked into the room and found her crying in front of the mirror.

Getting out of bed, I walked to the bathroom to relieve myself; immediately noticing that I had a bad case of bed hair.  As much as I wanted to avoid that for the time being, I knew the best way to fix this was to take a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately after entering the shower, I was overwhelmed by new sensations as the water hit my newly sensitive skin.  I chose to avoid washing around my chest because I knew that would be too much.  Eventually I finished in the shower and got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drying myself off, I remembered what Corinne did with her hair in the morning.  I quickly found a hairdryer and went to work. It was not long before my hair was presentable; at least enough that I could go outside if I wanted to.  As I walked back to the bedroom, it dawned on me that I was suddenly becoming worried about my appearance when going outside.  I wondered if I was gaining some of Ashley\u2019s mannerisms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith school canceled for the near future, I didn\u2019t have anything to do today.  With that in mind, I settled on a causal outfit to wear; consisting of a pair of Capri pants and a top.  Once I was satisfied, I decided to continue reading Ashley\u2019s diaries for information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************<br>\r\nA short time later, I was reading a recent entry about a day at the beach Ashley had spent with some girlfriends.  To my embarrassment, it went into excruciating detail about how cute some of the guys at the beach were.  Reading that part of the entry, now that I was Ashley I wondered if I\u2019d think that way about boys; obsessing over how cute they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to read another entry when I heard the doorbell; I briefly froze in fear because I thought it was Ashley returning home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the diary down, I went downstairs to see who it was.  Peeking through the window, I was surprised to not only see Kevin, the captain of the soccer team, as well as Corinne. Putting on my best Ashley face, I opened the door and said, \u201cKevin, Corinne; like what are you two doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, it is like bad enough that I\u2019m in this losers body; now I have people actually thinking that I\u2019m her.\u201d  Pausing, \u2018Corinne\u2019 turned to me and said, \u201cIt\u2019s me, Allison; I got shifted into the body of that Corinne Thompson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all my strength not to lash out at Allison for saying that about my sister\u2019s body; because I knew that would definitely give me away.  Looking from me to Allison, in a feminine tone, \u2018Kevin\u2019 said, \u201cAt least you guys are still girls; it\u2019s like totally weird being a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure to stay in character, I said, \u201cErin, is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d Sighing, Erin said, \u201cCan we come in, it\u2019s about to start raining.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was relieved that, for the moment, I\u2019d convinced them I was Ashley.  Stepping aside, I said, \u201cYeah, come on in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the living room, Allison and I watched as Erin struggled to find a comfortable seating position. \u201cYou guys think this is so funny, don\u2019t you.\u201d  Seeing the grins on our faces, Erin said, \u201cHow would you guys feel if you were suddenly turned into a boy, and I made fun of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe would not like it one bit.\u201d  Sighing, I said, \u201cSorry; we\u2019ll work on that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, I said, \u201cSo what are you guys doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell with the phones down, and the power out in parts of the city, we wanted to see if you were alright.\u201d Glancing at Erin, Allison said, \u201cEven Erin agreed that walking here as a soccer player was a good idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo like what happened after the Shift; where\u2019d you guys go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe stayed at my house since it was closer to school.\u201d  Sighing, Allison said, \u201cMy dad got shifted with a 16-year-old pregnant girl from the next town; while my mom is now in the body of college football player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sucks for him.\u201d Turning to Erin, I said, \u201cHow about your folks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t affected at all; which is like so weird.\u201d Pausing, Eric said, \u201cI guess only like 10% of the world was unaffected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I was one of the lucky ones then.\u201d Leaning back, I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from my parents at all; I hope they\u2019re alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably fine, but just can\u2019t get in touch just yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued talking for a while; I was confident that I was successfully fooling them into thinking I was Ashley.  After a while, I got up and said, \u201cAre you guys hungry?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cI think there\u2019s still some sausage pizza left over from my dinner last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, that sounds fine.\u201d  Exchanging a glance with Erin, Allison said, \u201cI\u2019ll help you with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into the kitchen with Allison behind me. I was about to open the fridge when she suddenly grabbed me and spun me around. \u201cWhat the hell, Ally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can drop the act, we know you\u2019re not really Ashley.\u201d  Pushing me against the fridge, as Erin walked into the room, Allison said, \u201cWho are you; and why are you pretending to be Ashley?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine, you got me; I\u2019m not really Ashley.\u201d  Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m Evan Thompson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat loser from the astronomy club?\u201d looking at me, Allison said, \u201cWhy are you like pretending to be Ashley?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d  Pausing, I said, \u201cIf you guys sit down, I\u2019ll tell it to you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You were kind of expecting John to be embarrassed to be in this body, but instead he surprises both of you by blurting out \"Well guys, I've solved one of the great mysteries of the universe - These are real!\" while sticking out his very large and not very well covered breasts.  He starts back up \"Hey do you want to feel them and see for yourselves?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops open \"Um, no, that's alright.\".  You are surprised at your own answer.  Just a few minutes ago when you were a guy, you probably would have said yes, but now you find the idea somewhat revolting.  Apparently Ryan does now too because he replies in an almost shrill voice \"Dude, aren't you embarrassed to be dressed like that\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looks down at his flimsy blouse, rather short mini skirt, and long red boots and then laughs to himself \"Not really, if you've got it you might as well flaunt it.  Hey guys, I do have a serious question though.  Do you suddenly find guys attractive?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't given it much thought with all the chaos and confusion going on around you, but now that things in the classroom have calmed down quite a bit, you look around and are somewhat disheartened to find that yes, you do find boys to be cute, and you no longer seem to be attracted to girls.  You look at John and say \"Umm, I'm not sure I like this, but yeah I do.\".  Ryan scoffs at first, but after a minute or so he admits the same thing.  John, sounding more like Tara than himself says \"Good, because I find them downright hot now!\".  Both you and Ryan look at each other and shrug your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Curly suddenly speaks up \"Okay class, we have taken roll of both who you really are and whose bodies you now occupy.  In a little while we should have a list of everyone in the school and we will pass out the lists to everyone but until then feel free to keep calling or texting friends and family to make sure they are alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look around the class, you can see that the panic has pretty much subsided (except for a handful of students who obviously feel that they have been robbed in this switch - for instance Jim Adkins who was one of the star jocks is sitting there sulking in the body of Joe Jensen who is a fat nerdy kid with very few friends and Kristy Parker who was a very hot chick but now looks very unhappy in the body of Jim Underwood who is a nerdy scrawny kid who always gets picked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly......</span></div></div>",

You were experiencing a phenomenon that would later become a source of intense study for sociologists and psychologist; the effects the body on the mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t always happen, but often people who landed in starkly different bodies suffered changes to their personality. You didn\u2019t know any of that then, but Tara\u2019s personality wasn\u2019t just the product of her life, her DNA itself made her a highly promiscuous girl; she had a genetic predisposition to be the way she was and now it was part of you. Whatever force was behind the Great Shift swapped people\u2019s memories and sense of identity, but things there are affected by the body, like taste in food (often) sexual orientation, stayed with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also discovered that language was not kept in the same place in the brain as what was swapped, people could remember how they spoke before, but when they spoke it came out as the body was trained to speak. It could be as simple as an English man (swapped with a Texan) who ends up with a southern drawl or as dramatic as trading with a Japanese and not been able to speak English. Another big change for those affected was the change in mental capacity, although people kept their memories and knowledge, the ability to process it and understand new things was controlled by the brain your identity is been housed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your case all this simply meant that you liked to dress just as slutty as Tara had, your libido is just as high as Tara\u2019s had been, speak with her sultry, sexually stimulating tones and had her higher than normal intellect (which she had used to manipulate everyone around her).You sit there, waiting for any announcements or anything to tell you what was going on but the school was in chaos again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tara obviously feels more comfortable around you as well.  You try flipping the channels for a bit, but most of them are blank, and there are some live feeds of newsrooms with no one in them.  It's more boring than frightening, and the shock of what has happened seems to be more numbing than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost average people didn't think about this at the time, but airports and sky-ways were in absolute chaos.  Like most of the world, pilots shifted bodies along with everyone else. Being professionals, the first thing that many pilots did was rush to the airport towers and see if they could help land planes.  There were also news reports at later dates of some pilots finding themselves as passengers on different planes, who immediately ran to the cockpits of planes and made a safe landing.  Despite the chaos though, there were surprisingly few crashes, less than five percent of planes in the air had a landing involving fatalities, about ten percent had very rough landings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small traffic helicopter was not one of the fortunate ones.  About a block away, you could hear propellers getting closer and closer to the ground until there was a big bang.  Like most people, you were conflicted and wanted to help, but were unsure if you'd do more harm than good in your new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, you wanted to be a good citizen and help out, but on the other, you figure the less people who are on the streets, the safer it would be.

Thankfully, you learned at a later date that the pilot was rescued and made a full recovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit by the phone and sigh.  You didn't know this at the time, but some people where shifted across continents, they found themselves in remote villages where no one spoke their language.  You were concerned about that possibility, as it went through you mind that you mom might have been trapped in some government lab under a mountain, or your sister was stuck out in the middle of the ocean in a fishing boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs night came, this made it hard to sleep.  Well, those thoughts and your new body made it hard to sleep.  You twist and turn, trying to find the best position for your breasts to lay, eventually you give up and ask Tara how she did it.  She laughs a pathetic laugh as she sees you struggle.  You tell her she can have Corinne's room, and in a sad attempt to keep things normal you take your old room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about three o'clock, you fall asleep out of exhaustion.<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, you get Tara's dreams as well, and it is not anything that a guy should ever have to experience.  You are sitting on a bleacher, looking at Cody Millar, the team's linebacker.  At break he walks up to you and starts flirting, the next think you know, you are at a fancy restaurant, where he starts rubbing your legs under the table.  Once that's done you find yourself naked in his bedroom, as he slowly approaches you with a matching set of clothes.  As he leans over, you thankfully wake up, and then proceed to run to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, you come to your senses and see that you are in your own home.  You notice that you are in Tara's body, so at least you didn't shift into a different city overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and get dressed, but find that you now find your clothes uncomfortable, they're itchy, and dirty, plus you wore them yesterday, so if you wore them again today, you'd be breaking some fashion law.  You are too big to fit into Corinne's clothes, so you try to go to your mothers room, but find that you just can't bring yourself to wear anything that she has.  You're not sure if it's your mind or Tara's body that is blocking you from doing this, but either way, it isn't happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, you go downstairs and turn on the TV, some news stations seem to be up and running in a limited capacity.  There is a ten year old girl who used to be the weatherman, telling everyone the days forecast.  There is a black man with a strong African accent who used to be Elaine Cho, he is trying over-hype the situation for the sake of ratings.  But after about ten minutes, all that they talk about is rumors, no scientists are mentioned, and their is no official word from the government.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide that you're sick of waiting around, you're going to go and do something.  You wake up Tera, who is still in Corinne's body.  At first she is in shock seeing her own body standing above her, and gently shaking her, but after a minute, her mind processes the information and remembers the events of yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to check on your place?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" she says, \"The only problem is that I live on the other side of the city.\"</span></div></div>",

You didn't have too much experience driving, just the times your mom taught you how to navigate an empty parking lot.  But walking from one end of the city to the other, especially when you are a female, isn't the best idea in a time of chaos.<br>\r\nYou thankfully realize that your neighbor has left the car in their garage, and you know that they leave an extra key hidden behind a loose patio stone in their backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do feel guilty, but under the circumstances, you hope that they'd understand.  You take the key, and open their door.  After looking for about a minute, you come across a key-rack, which has an extra key to their car.  You take the car key, lock up the house and slip the key back under the stone. With any luck, you'll be able to drive to Tara's place and back before anyone even notices the car is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you get the car out of the garage, you get Tara to come down and give you directions to her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou adjust the mirrors, and stop for a second to look at your reflection.  You do not like your colors right now, a series of flashes in your brain gives you glimpses of how you could make yourself up to be more presentable.  You quickly shake off the notion, and start up the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that the car only has half a tank of gas, and you're not sure when the gas stations will reopen.  You make a mental note only to use the car if absolutely necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drive slowly through the streets, you slowly move around crashes of cars on the street.  It turns out that most of the wrecks came right after the first great shift, when people found themselves in an unfamiliar vehicle with only seconds to respond.  Some people who were shifted behind the wheel didn't even know how to drive.  As a result, many highways were a mess and nearly unusable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drive through the street, you find that you're remarkably controlled behind the wheel.  Tara gives the occasional instruction, but for the most part, you seem to know what you are doing.  It turns out that Tara has had some experience behind the wheel, (and not just in the back seat,) and her body seems to know what it is doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilar cases of reflexes coming from memory were reported throughout the world.  This has led some scientists to theorize that muscles contain a type of memory far stronger than previously imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you go down the streets, you see the occasional broken window.  Historians now believe that since the second shift, most vandalism during this time wasn't caused by criminals, but people who shifted to bodies that had no way to get back into their property accept for breaking and entering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally make it to Tara's home, only to find that...</span></div></div>",

There is a strange symbol sprayed over her bed, and her closets are empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" she cries, as she breaks down and sobs.<br>\r\n\"It's alright.\" you say putting your arm around her, trying to comfort her.<br>\r\n\"You don't understand, I lost everything.  I spent thousands on my clothing collection. A lifetime of work, gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't say anything, but a piece of Tara that is still inside of you wants to scream at her.

It seems that some people had the same idea as you, and a good portion of the food is already gone.  You still see some vegetables, and some fruits, a few of which are already going bad.

You realize that this is the nicest your sister has been to you in years, then you remember that she's not your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass the bananas and decide to eat one now to keep your strength up.  After all, Tara would probably want you taking care of her body.  You offer her a banana, but she rudely refuses it.  \"<i>Fine, I'll just have some fun at her expense.</i>\" you think.  You look at her and slowly peel the banana.  \"It's so big!\" you say in a sultry voice.<br>\r\n\"Quit it.\" Tara says.<br>\r\nYou start breathing heavily.  \"This...is...exactly what I needed.\" you say sticking the banana into your mouth, slowly pushing it back and forth, off the inside of your cheek.<br>\r\n\"Enough.\" says Tara.  She is insulted, not because it's a gross exaggeration of her, but because a part of her knows what you did was in character.<br>\r\nYou take a bite out of the Banana.  \"Mmm\" you hum while chewing.  You then chew the banana with your mouth open, letting little pieces fall out.  At this point Tara finally laughs.<br>\r\n\"You're enjoying your protein a bit too much.\" she says.<br>\r\nYou quickly finish eating the banana, and then look around, suddenly fearing that some guy might have seen you and got the wrong impression.  Thankfully, there are no guys at this store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Tara continue shopping and are about to pay when you realize that it is pointless.  There is no one there too pay, and the doors unlocked.<br>\r\nDoing your attempt at a sexy looking walk, you push the cart out of the store and blow a kiss to the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't realize this until years later, but that video of you eating the banana and doing the sexy walk with the cart had actually been recorded by the camera and made its way onto the internet, where it was edited onto other videos and put up on sites of questionable reputation.  You don't think Tara ever found out though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Tara pack all the food in the car, about a week's worth, but before you start the car, you look at the clothing store that the mall has.<br>\r\nYou really don't want to be wearing the same pair of clothes if you could avoid it, and no one stopped you from getting stuff this time.  But can you get that lucky twice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolice might look one way if you just took food, but if you took some clothes, would the authorities be as lenient if they caught you?<br>\r\nTara looks at you and says, \"Where too now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou respond: </span></div></div>",

Part of the reason that you even thought about going to Tara's house was to pick up some of her old clothes to wear until this situation was fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the clothing store, you again find that it is unlocked.  It looked like whoever became the manager just decided to leave without closing down.  You go inside and look at the clothes, only to realize that you have no clue how girls pick out their clothes.  You look at the tags and see a series of numbers that mean nothing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part is picking out bras.  You don't know what you're looking for, or what to try on.  As a result, you just grab as many things as you can, and make two trips back to the car.  You don't look very ladylike with your arms carrying forty pounds of clothes, but at the moment you don't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gathering enough clothes to ensure that you'll find some outfit that your body with agree with, you get in the car and prepare to leave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel guilty about what you just did, stealing goes against everything your mother ever taught you.  But later you realize that people around the world did the same thing during this time.  Places everywhere were robbed and looted, and since the government couldn't determine if the people who robbed the store still had the same brain patterns a week later, no one was ever charged for their crimes.  Because of this, the Great Shift was like a blank slate for individuals everywhere.  Even most prisoners were released, since their bodies no longer housed the same minds they had when they committed their crimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, most of the people who looted did not stay in their bodies long enough to make their efforts worthwhile.  Some had foresight and hid precious items that they came across, usually by burying it in dirt or sand, so if another shift happened, they'd no where treasure was.  This has lead to the comeback of treasure hunting, when once all the shifting had stopped, many people bought metal detectors and started searching for small fortunes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finished looting the store, you start to look around and realize that you have lost Tara. Looking around in a panic, and your mind flashing about all the awful things that could happen to her, you immediately calm down as you see your sister's body running out of a nearby drugstore, carrying two plastic bags full of merchandise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have there?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Only the essentials.\" says Tara, as she opens the bags to reveal a ton of cosmetics.<br>\r\nYou're speechless.<br>\r\n\"We're getting through this event in style.\" she says, applying some lipstick.  Normally, you'd turn your head when you see your sister do that, but now, your mind just tells you it is something normal people do.<br>\r\n\"Oh, here, I got you these.\" she say pulling out a box of tampons, \"you'll need them in a few days.<br>\r\nYou shiver, thinking about the horror that awaits you.  You've heard all those nightmare stories about girls during their time of the month, you'd hate to think what you'd be like.  A part of you is hoping that she is playing a prank and getting you back for annoying her with the banana, but another part of you knows better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your sister/Tara start to drive back to your place.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But he lucked out with the second one.  At least Tommy had been in a safe environment, in a familiar body, that was similar to him.  You look down at your tiny breasts, and start to get depressed about your situation.  While it's true, Tommy had lost about four years, you had lost anywhere from six to ten.  At least Megan's body wasn't fat or ugly, but you did get constant hunger pains as you walked through the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who were you last time?\" asks Tommy.<br>\r\n\"I was the girl that all the guys liked.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Yuck.\"<br>\r\n\"Ya, boys liking you is yucky.\" you tell Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at Tommy, you realized that he sucked at being a girl.  His long blond hair kept falling into his eyes, and he had a habit of touching his new face over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you found a apartment where a girl similar to Tommy's age had once lived.  The problem was that judging by the girls clothing, whoever she was had been a girly girl.  Most of the outfits in the closet were bright pink, and frilly.  You tried to find some pants that would fit the kid, but the only think that looked like it might fit the poor boy/girl was a frilly skirt, with matching top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a terrified look in his eyes, Tommy seems to be scared of the dress.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a sudden, blindingly bright flash and then everything went dark.  Eventually I woke up... how long I was out for, I don't really know but it couldn't have been that long; I think the clock on the wall had still said was a like quarter after 9:00 which meant it was still third period.  I looked around; something felt... off.  I noticed a few other students were awake, grabbing at themselves, screaming... nobody I recognized, since if I shared a class with them I would've known.  I kept looking... what the hell?  This definitely wasn't Mr. Tomlin's class.  I saw a teacher passed out on his desk, Mr. Baker I think it was which would mean I was in American Government, I think.  But if I was, how'd I end up in there?  Did someone knock me out and drag me there?  No, of course not, why would someone do that?  I went to rub my forehead and that's when I noticed something was definitely wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy skin was darker than normal... far darker.  I was a pasty white kid, I knew that, so then why was my arm a dark brown color?  That's when I notice that my hands were different as well, smaller and more slender; almost feminine!  I checked them out... yeah, they definitely changed.  \"What the hell?\" I said to myself, startled by my voice... if I thought my hands were feminine my voice was moreso... with a bit of a twang, maybe to it as well.  I looked down and, of course, took notice of the breasts: they were definitely noticeable but not terribly big... about the same size as my sister's so maybe around a B?  I don't know.  Further down, I noticed the cheerleading outfit in the familiar blue, gold and white colors of the school; it was a Friday and the cheerleaders tended to wear their uniforms all day, due to football games.  So I was now a girl, a black girl at that, and a cheerleader, but who?  Maybe I could find something in... her purse!  I noticed it sitting on the floor next to the desk.  I rummaged through it, hoping to find something, anything.  I lucked out and found her wallet, opening it up and removing the driver's license: Nia Lewis.  Holy crap!  I had ended up in the body of Nia Lewis!  Nia was a member of the cheerleading squad with Stacey Everett... Stacey's best friend, in fact.  She was H-O-T and I definitely fantasized about her more than once.  Well, now I didn't have to fantasize about seeing her naked, I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there were more pressing issues: I grabbed up my (well, Nia's) stuff and headed out into the hallways.  Now the school was an outdoor high school which was always kind of nice but today... well, the breeze kept blowing Nia's skirt around and up against her... well my, I guess, bare legs.  I tried my best to ignore it and it was rather easy.  The same scene of confusion and panic was everywhere, on everyone's faces.  I guess a lot of people had poured out into the hallways, too.  I could've asked them what was going on but right now, I was more intent on getting back to Tomlin's class.  I'd seen these body switch stories that show up in everything, so if I was in Nia's body, then she must've been in mine!  I figured it would've been a good idea to try and sort things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn my way there, however, something caught my eye: Corinne!  Holy crap, I was never more happy to see her!  I ran over to her, calling out her name.  \"Corinne!  Corinne!\" I called as I ran.  She seemed to be in the same state of shock as everyone else and didn't notice me.  As I got to her, I practically dove at her, wrapping my arms around her.  \"Oh god, Corinne!  I'm... I'm so glad to see you.\"  After a moment of nothing, though, she shoved me off.  \"Corinne...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Nia, what the hell?\" she asked, confused, \"Why are you hugging me?  Why's everyone acting so strange?  Why...\"  I approached her, ready to comfort her.  She seemed distraught and cheerleader body or not, I was still her brother.  Her next words, though, stopped me dead in my tracks.  \"Why am I in a girl's body?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped.  I couldn't believe it, she had been affected too?  I figured, though, if anything now was the time to play it cool... to stay calm.  Freaking out wasn't going to help things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just calm down.\" I stated calmly, \"Calm down and tell me what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know!\" she said, looking up at me, \"I'm... I was in gym class, we had just got done dressing, and then I blacked out.  Next thing I know I'm... I...  I woke up in a girl's body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, calm down, it's gonna--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she kept on talking, \"I'm... I'm my best friend's sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped.  I stopped right there.  This definitely wasn't Corinne but... no.  No way.  It couldn't be!  But, well... hesitantly I spoke.  Just one word, \"Ryan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah.  But how do you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, it's me!  It's Evan!\" I exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan, in Corinne's body, just stared at me in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's true.  The same thing happened to me.\" I explained, \"I was listening to one of Mr. Tomlin's boring-ass lectures and then BOOM!  Here I am, in Nia Lewis' body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.  That's just--\" he started<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, \"When you were in the 8th grade, you asked Sophia Mendoza out.  She turned you down and you threw a frog at her when were disecting them which got you suspended for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan?\" he asked, wide-eyed.  \"Holy shit, man!  It's you!  Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" I nodded, \"like I said I ended up in Nia's body.  I figured she might've ended up in mine so I was going back to Tomlin's room.  But then--CRAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... going by that logic, then maybe Corinne ended up in your body.\" I stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, yeah.  Maybe.\" Ryan nodded, \"But aren't you concerned about seeing if Nia's in yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah.  But I mean... Ryan, it's my sister!  I... I kinda think I should look for her first.\"  I paused.  I really did want to find Corinne but if I did, my body might not be in Tomlin's class and it could be a pain to find.  On the other hand, as much of a pain as she could be Corinne was still my sister.  I had to find her...</span></div></div>",

We made our way through even more students and teachers.  I saw Mrs. O'Toole plead in desperation for Amanda Silverman to give her back her body (if I got stuck in that ancient body, I'd be pretty terrified, too I have to admit).  Mark Kaplan was sitting on the ground, crying, asking for his mommy.  \"...I mean, I guess bein' each other is better than bein' that mummy Mrs. O'Toole.\" I heard Lynne Chapman say to her boyfriend, Omar Baez.  Rhonda Kellerman was checking herself out... I practically had to drag Ryan past that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just went on and on like this: fear, panic, a little bit of joy and a whole ton of confusion.  We managed to come up to the gym, it took us longer than it would've normally due to getting distracted by all the other people.  It wasn't as full as I thought it was going to be so seeing Ryan's body would've been relatively easy and yet, I didn't see it anywhere.  Crap, where the hell could it have gone?  We checked around the inside of the gym, the locker rooms, outside of the gym... nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" I exclaimed out of frustration, \"She has to be around here somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan was about to say something but he was suddenly cut off by loud, angry yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO TO ME?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe turned to see where it had come from and saw Joshua Adams, one of the anime club dorks, storm his slightly overweight body towards us.  We immediately stood up and were about to back away but, due to the density of people, didn't really have much room to move.  Neither did Joshua but that didn't really stop him as he angrily shoved people out of his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT.  THE.  HELL?!\" he shouted as he approached us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just looked at him, incredibly confused, \"Uh, J-Joshua what's wrong?\" I said, stuttering a little bit.  He might've been a super-nerd but for as pissed as he was, I wasn't about to try and provoke him any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I got put in this geek's body!  And I'm assuming he's in mine!\" he continued yelling.  \"So again,\" with that he pushed passed me, getting up in Ryan's face, \"What did you do to me?!  GIVE ME BACK MY BODY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corinne?!\" I exclaimed in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but who--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, Corinne!\" I exclaimed, throwing my arms around Joshua's larger body, \"I... we were looking for you and I just... god.  I thought you were gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, wh-who are you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI regained my composure, letting go of Corinne and straightening myself up a little.  \"Corinne, it's me.  It's Evan.  I think... I think the same thing happened to me.  To EVERYBODY.  One minute I'm in class, the next I'm in Nia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.\" Corinne said, finally getting a good look at me, \"Holy crap!  I didn't even realize you were her.  Ugh, GOD!  You get an upgrade but me... UGH!  And this fat dork is in my body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\" I started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, actually it's Ryan in here.  Hi.\" he said, waving.  \"And yeah, Evan's right.  We saw stuff like this all around the school when we were coming over here to look for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look for me?  How?\" Corinne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Evan kinda thought that if he was in Nia's body, she might be in his and when he went to go back to his class, he found me.\" Ryan explained, \"So maybe the same thing happened to you but obviously--oh crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" I said, looking over at Ryan.  \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean we saw a lot of direct switches right?\" I nodded, \"But Corinne was in someone completely different.  So who knows if Nia's even in your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, you're right.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe pondered about what to do for a little bit when I heard a voice calling for Nia.  I turned my attention to see none other than the gorgeous Stacey Everett herself running towards us.  \"Nia!  Hey, Nia!\" she called as she ran over to us, \"Oh god.\" she said, stopping to catch her breath, \"I was looking everywhere for you!  What's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, \"Stacey... I'm not Nia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorinne, Ryan and I explained the whole thing to her.  Again.  She seemed quite taken aback by the entire thing.  \"Oh god, so you... you're just some random kid?\" she asked.  I nodded an affirmative, \"Oh crap, then where's Nia?!  I... I have to find her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been looking for her, too, actually.\" I said, \"I thought she might be in my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... can I help you guys?\" Stacey asked.  \"Nia's my best friend.  I just... I HAVE to find her.  Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey seemed desperate and she looked like she was about to lose it at any minute.  It would've made me a real asshole to say no to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's fine.\" I said, \"More people looking means we'd have an easier time of finding her or my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey Evan?\" Corinne suddenly spoke up.  \"I... I want to go home first.  I want to make sure Mom's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No!\" Ryan interjected, \"We HAVE to find Evan's body and we promised Stacey we'd look for Nia.  We've been sidetracked enough already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SIDETRACKED?!  It's my MOM for christ's sake!\" she yelled.  \"Look, we can go back home real fast, see if my Mom's alright, then come back here.  I mean, we live right down the street.  It's like a ten minute walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but Stacey--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, if you guys want see your mom first, I'm fine with it.\" Stacey said, seemingly trying to ease things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I guess that made my choice a LITTLE easier, but I still wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do.</span></div></div>",

It was not far away, only a five minutes walk, but Corrine in her new body started to sweat already after the first hundred meters. I could not avoid to smile a little bit, because she was right before, when she said, that I might have get an upgrade, because walking in Nia's body was so easy, everything felt so light and now the wind was no longer blowing that much, so even wearing a skirt didn't bother me to much\u2026<br>\r\nSo the normal 5 minutes walk took us nearly 20 minutes and a lot of sweat for Corrine in her new body.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Evan really wanted to find his sister Corinne and make sure she was alright, but with the way students and faculty members quickly pouring out of the school; or at least their bodies were anyways time to find anyone was limited. Evan quickly decided and told Ryan \"We'll head over towards the gym and see if Corinne was there inside your body. But I want to stop by Mr. Tomlin's class and find my body first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan really didn't want to wait to find his body either. \"Hey Evan, find your body and I'll find mine. If Corinne is in there, I'll bring her over to Mr. Tomlin's class to meet you.\" Ryan told Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good\" Evan said as he started running down the hallway towards the last class he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning down the hallway was a strange experience for Evan as he felt sensations that weren't familiar to him. Cold air breezed over his now bare legs as he ran while Nia's longer hair kept dangling off the back of his neck. Running itself was also different. His new stride felt wider and his balance felt off from having extra weight bouncing around on his chest. Luckily whatever bra Nia had been wearing kept her breasts from moving around too much or else Evan would have had a harder time running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after navigating the school hallways and constantly dodging other people who were either panicking or scurrying out to the parking lot, Evan finally made it to Mr. Tomlin's history classroom. Unfortunately it was completely deserted. Even Mr. Tomlin wasn't there. Evan walked inside and saw books and backpacks scattered all over the place as if everyone had ran out in mass hysteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan spotted his bag on the floor next to the chair where he had been sitting. He was about to pick it up and replace it with Nia's bag that he had been carrying when he was suddenly pushed into the wall and pinned in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me back my body you bitch!\" Evan's assailant said in a female voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Evan brought his attention to her, he saw that it was Patty Ashford. She was in his history class when all of craziness started. Patty was not a popular girl in school despite having a rather large pair of tits. She was slightly plump, wore glasses and always had acne on her face. But by judging by what she just said, he figured that it had to be Nia Lewis inside her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nia is that you?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea it is and I don't want to be in your big titted, loser body. So give me back mine.\" Nia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nia. I'm not Patty. I'm Evan from homeroom... I just came here looking for my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia inside Patty's body released Evan and stood there in shock before lashing out again. \"You mean I'm stuck inside this disgusting body and you're some white boy trapped in mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven nodded and said \"Yeah I am. Would having a black guy inside your body make you feel any better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want anybody inside my body! Give it back!\" Nia said frantically as she tried to pin Evan against the wall again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Evan was prepared for her and was able to fight back. After a long struggle, Evan finally gained the upper hand as Patty's out of shape body ran out of energy. Pinning Nia to the floor, Evan straddled her and held her arms against the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Nia. I had nothing to do with any of this. I'm just as much a victim as you are. You can either help me find out what's going on or stay the hell out of my way!\" Evan said angrily in a feminine twang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving up completely, Nia began to cry. \"I'm sorry. I just don't want to be Patty Ashford.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan climbed off of Nia and said \"And I don't want to be a cheerleader or a girl.\" Evan said as he used his new hands to emphasize his new body. Nia slowly stood back up when Ryan in Corinne's body came into the door and saw both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan! Corinne wasn't there. I found Coach Willis or at least his body crying in the corner of the gym. Apparently Lynne Chapman ended up in his body and she claims that Tara Johnson ended up in my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does she know that?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan made Corinne's face blush and said \"Because she told everyone there after she dropped my shorts and flashed everyone with my penis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia then asked \"What do we do now? Almost seems to have switched bodies and ran off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan said \"Well, Ryan and I will probably head to our homes which are not too far away. Judging by all the screaming and noise going on around us, school isn't a safe place to be right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not letting you out of my sight with my body.\" Nia said. \"Give me my backpack. I'll drive us to my house where I can keep an eye on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan had no problem taking off the feminine backpack off his shoulders and handing it over to Nia. As Nia fished out a key fob from the outer pouch, Evan walked over and picked up his backpack and put it on. He really wanted to go to his home and check on his mom and see if Corinne was there, but right now they needed to get out of the school before something bad happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trio of now females quickly headed towards a door in the hallway that led to the student parking lot, someone interrupted them and blocked their way...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The noises of screaming and things breaking seemed to get louder and louder with the more time they spent in school. At this point, all three seemed to become more fearful for their safety. As Nia led the way down the hallway towards the parking lot, Mr. Haynesworth stepped out of an empty classroom and blocked the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, everyone knew Mr. Haynesworth as the school janitor that was in his early fifties that had one hell of a beer gut. Evan remembered that it was only a few years ago that Mr. Haynesworth played Santa Clause for his middle school play and did a pretty good job. Nobody really knew him well, but very few people ever had anything bad to say about him. But now something seemed wrong with him. It was like he had an evil look on his face and he was up to no good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three young bitches going to walk by and not stop and not say hi?\" Mr. Haynesworth's body said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan spoke up first \"Look Mr. Haynesworth, we need to get home. The school has gone crazy and it isn't safe to be here anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't no Mr. Haynesworth but I can keep you safe if you suck my new dick.\" Mr. Haynesworth's body said. He then pulled his pants and briefs down to reveal an old but hairy penis covered in grey hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan came to the realization that not only was he in Nia Lewis' body, but her female body was no match for a man's body and could easily be overpowered or raped if he wasn't careful. Not knowing what else to do, he quickly turned around and yelled \"Run!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students ran back down the hall from where they came and managed to lose whoever was in Mr. Haynesworth's body. They were lucky that he initially tried to chase them with his pants still down and tripped himself. After a moment of catching their breathes, Nia led the other two out one of the back doors near the track and field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside, the noise of chaos and anarchy was much louder. Some of the houses off in the distance had smoke coming out of them. there was even a totaled car that had drove onto the football field and smashed right into one of the goal posts. None of them knew who is was, but it was clear that whoever it had been was probably dead as their bloody body stuck out from the shattered windshield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio quickly went around the side of the school towards the parking lot. They were scared and on edge. But when they made it around the corner and caught their first glimpse of the school parking lot, things went from bad to worse. Most of the cars never made it out of the parking lot. Many had formed a large pile up by the exits. There were even a couple cars that were burning and several students were fighting with makeshift weapons. Whoever landed inside Omar Baez's body was going to have a painful time when they woke up if they weren't already dead. Another student had beat him onto the ground with a baseball bat until he stopped moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to go near any of that danger, Evan told Nia and Ryan \"This way. My house isn't too far away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia reluctantly followed both Evan and Ryan and didn't complain. The trek home was quite unusual for Evan and Ryan this time. The streets were completely abandoned. Some of the houses they past had broken windows or cars haphazardly parked on the front lawn as if somebody drove off the road and narrowly avoided the house. Still, there were some people who could be heard screaming and yelling. This kept them all walking towards Evan's home at a quick pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't before too long that they managed to make it to Evan's house. Ryan lived a few streets down but decided to stay with his friend since he didn't feel safe walking home. The entire street where Evan lived looked more or less the same but they could tell that something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his key that he pulled out of his backpack, Evan opened the front door and let them inside...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They could be hurt or even dying and there was nothing Evan could do about it. Ryan could by the look on his face that all of this was all beginning to get to Evan. Even if his face was that of Nia Lewis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look man. Maybe they are just having a hard time making it back home. We ran into plenty of chaos on the way here. Whatever this is, if it affected the entire town or even the entire county, it might take a while to get back.\" Ryan consoled his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's your TV? Maybe the news can tell us what is going on.\" Nia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan led his guests into the living room where he turned on the TV and sat down on the couch in a very unladylike way. Nia was clearly unhappy with Evan making her body look bad but decided to not say anything. Flipping channels with the remote, Evan turned the channel over to the local news station to see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChannel 6 News was still broadcasting. An elderly lady claiming to be the news anchor, Don Bauer was trying to report on what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Although this mass body swapping phenomenon has affected the entire state and surrounding areas, reports are coming in from across the country and overseas of people switching bodies with other people.\" Don Bauer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan watched a streamer on the bottom of the screen state \"The Federal Government urges people to seek shelter as it tries to implement martial law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon Bauer seemed to be listening to something being said from the headphones that he was wearing. After a brief pause, he said \"I'm just receiving word that our producer who was in the studio with us at the time of this great shift ended up in the body of a Peruvian man that was waiting to board a flight in Mexico City. He said that the airport is in utter chaos and dozens of planes that were in the sky have crashed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streamer on the bottom of the screen updated and said \"The President has been located and will address the nation tonight at 8PM.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the news was not making Evan or the others feel any better. They originally tuned in hoping to get some answers and hear some good news. Now all they could do was worry about their loved ones being switched with literally anyone on the planet or on one of the hundreds of planes that were in the sky and crashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... We're now going over to Elaine Cho, who is live down town.\" Down Baura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen switched over to a news feed of downtown near city hall. In the screen, an attractive blonde woman in her early thirties that was dressed like a businesswoman or a secretary held a microphone and began reporting. \"Hi. I'm Elaine Cho and I'm reporting here from downtown, a couple blocks away from city hall. The entire city is in anarchy as even police, firefighters and paramedics all found themselves in other bodies earlier this afternoon when what people are now calling \"The Great Shift\" happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Elaine, Evan watched as ambulances were being loaded with injured people while a little girl was directing traffic. There was another man seen dressed in a chef's outfit getting into a police cruiser and driving off with lights and sirens going. Unable to watch or hear anymore, Evan turned the TV off with the remote. The others didn't complain and joined Evan at sitting in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia was the first to break the silence and said \"I need to find out if my parents are safe.\" She then opened up her backpack and pulled out her cellphone and tried calling presumably one of her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan sat there staring at the TV in his own world. He clearly was worried about his family. Ryan was about to say something to him when Nia hung up her phone and began cursing. \"I can't dial anybody. Everything is busy.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried about his friend, Ryan scooted over and sat down next to his best friend and said \"Try not to think about the worst that could happen Evan. Nia can't even call anyone, maybe your parents or sister can't call you either. Let's wait this out and give them time to come home or call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan was right and Evan did feel a little better knowing that they could still be out there and held up with all the anarchy going on right now. \"You're right. But if we're going to stay here, I need to get out of this outfit and wear something a little less drafty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just want to get my body naked and be a pervert\" Nia retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we're stuck in these bodies for the time being, eventually all of us will have to eat, sleep and use the bathroom.\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But I'll be my keeping my eye on you Evan.\" Nia bitterly conceited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He went to get dressed, but turned around and noticed that Nia was following him as he got to the door of his room. \"Look Nia. I'm just going to change into some sweats really quick. You can wait out here. I won't be long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia's acne ridden face scowled. \"Bullshit. I told you I'm not leaving you out of my sight until I get my body back!\" she said venomously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Nia... Didn't you see the news? Everybody is switched and nobody knows how or even if this can be reversed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It better be! I don't want to spend the rest of my life as four-eyed Patty.\" Nia said as she used her hands to refer to her current body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan crossed his arms over his chest but quickly moved them under his new breasts before glaring at Nia with a look of frustration. It only took a moment but Nia seemed to take the hint that Evan wasn't going to let her watch him get changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Get changed, but you better be right out or else I'll...\" Nia threatened before being cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only getting changed Nia... and nothing else! Go back down stairs and see if there are any updates on what is going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia huffed a bit but she knew Evan was right. Feeling defeated, she turned around and went down stairs to the living room with Ryan, who was still watch the television. Evan went into his room and swiftly closed the door. \"Finally.\" he muttered as he took a deep breath. Just hearing Nia's voice with her twang still surprised him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he did was to look for something better to wear. Most of his clothes were strewn about the floor of his room and were already dirty. He picked up a shirt off the floor and quickly smelled it to see if it was still \"clean\". It had such a pugnant odor that he nearly gagged. Eventually, he made his way over to his dresser and settled a pair of dark blue sweats and a grey T-shirt. he took them to over to his bed and began taking off Nia's cheerleader uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little trouble finding the button take off the skirt, Evan was down to just a bra and panties. He was about to put on 'his clothes' when curiosity started to get the better of him. Looking over his body he still couldn't believe it. His skin was so much darker than what he was used to... and having breasts. He could see his cleavage inside the bra. He brought up his hands and tried to cup them, but as he did so, the thin bra straps dug into his shoulders. \"Ughh. How do girls deal with wearing these things every day?\" he complained to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to be as comfortable as he could, Evan decided to take off the bra. He struggled for a few moments before figuring it out. Once he got it off, he brought his hands back up to his breasts. Evan couldn't believe the first pair of tits he ever got to touch were Nia Lewis'. They were dark and squishy with even darker silver dollar sized nipples. His fondling began to create a tingling sensation in his groin. But before he could go further, Evan got a hold of himself. \"I can't do this. Nia is just outside.\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan quickly put on his sweatpants and threw his shirt on over his braless breasts. His sweats were a bit baggy and his shirt was somewhat tight around the chest, but he felt better being out of Nia's girly cheerleader uniform which was in a pile on the floor. Feeling as comfortable as he was going to get, Evan went to rejoin Ryan and Nia downstairs when suddenly.......</span></div></div>",

Do you know how hard I worked to get my body to where it is at?!\" Nia demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you're the only one who lost their body!? Look at the news anchor! He had to have lost 30 or 40 years! You could have ended up in Connie Somers' body and be spending the rest of your life in a wheel chair!\" Evan ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia stopped crying, but her eyes were still bloodshot. She knew Evan was right. Becoming a pudgy white girl with glasses was nothing compared to becoming old or crippled. She quietly put her new glasses back on and sulked as she continued to watch the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news went back to Elaine Cho at City Hall. This time she wasn't wearing the blazer she wore earlier and her blouse had the top button undone. \"...I'm Elaine Cho for those of you who are just tuning in. I'm downtown at City Hall where the Mayor has urged citizens to seek shelter and avoid the streets. It's utter chaos right now out here as dozens of vehicles crashed and countless people are dead as a result of what experts now call \"The Great Shift\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the teenagers continued to watch, Nia spoke up. \"You're not wearing a bra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan quickly looked down then over towards her before shrugging his shoulders and saying \"The straps were digging into my shoulders and were uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNia glared at him and gave him a dirty look before looking back at the television. She looked like she was going to say something but changed her mind at the last minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElaine Cho continued talking about how the local hospital was over flowing with people who were injured as a result of The Great Shift when suddenly she fainted and fell onto the ground. The camera was still rolling as a couple people ran up to her to see if she was alright. \"Elaine! Are you okay? What's wrong?\" a man in a fire fighter uniform asked her. The teenagers watching the television thought she had fainted or that there must be something wrong with the body she ended up in, but the blonde woman came to after a few moments. \"Elaine!\" the person dressed like a fireman asked. The problem was that the she was speaking some Asian language and freaking out. The camera feed quickly cut out but the banner on the bottom updated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New reports are coming in of \"after shocks\" where some people are switching bodies again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan chuckled. \"Hey Nia, maybe you'll get lucky and switch into another body since you hate being in Patty's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we're not out of the woods yet\" Evan chimed in.</span></div></div>",

I knew that even if I found Corinne here, it might not be her in the body.  I had to go home to see if Mom was alright, and besides, no matter who mom and Corinne might've become, they'll most likely go home as well.  It was worth a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I managed my way through the croud, despite wearing high heels.  It was difficult, and I nearly fell a few times, but thankfully there were enough people lingering that I was able to make it outside.  Now I had to find her car... if only I had some way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I remember her purse, so I dig through it and find some keys.  I try pressing the unlock buttons, hoping to hear the locks activate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, keys, lead me to the car...\" I say to myself.  It was incredibly strange to hear Ms. Cunningham's voice come from my mouth, but for now I had bigger things to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes of searching and cycling through buttons led me to her car.  I got in and tried familiarizing myself with the controls.  I was still working on my permit, but I'd driven a little... I wasn't comfortable with it at all, but it was going to have to do.  I can't walk home in high heels, I'd probably break them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, driving wasn't as hard as I figured it'd be.  It was almost like her body was so used to driving that I could borrow her knowledge and use it.  Not sure how, but that must've been it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed to get home.  The scene there wasn't any better than the school, although it was less crowded.  Still, there were arguments, people in states of panic, joy, and intense curiosity.  Mom's car was still home, so she must've been here still... if she's here at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk to the door, crossing my fingers... please let mom be here...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>      \"Ooh-kay...\" I sighed to myself, inhaling and exhaling deeply, still not quite used to thru mature, yet, sweet, melodic voice that emerged from my Iips. Upon arrival to my own front door, despite the fact that this was my own home, a sense of dread managed to fester inside. I brushed my shoulder-length brunette hair behind my ears, the softness of the hair something to get used to. After which, I noted a breeze that flew between my skirt, brushing my bare, smooth legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       I turned around and observed the current situation before continuing. The setting reminded me of the extent to which, whatever was happening, had truly gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"It looks like the end of the world, or something...\" I sigh, nervously scratching the back of my head, scratching an itch about one of my ankles with the other heel-donning foot. It truly did resemble the apocalypse, if TV and media had taught you anything. The streets lay empty, a few stragglers passing by, some looking angry, some happy, some utterly depressed, but, most confused. The occasional crashed car decorated the streets, thus far, probably crashed immediately after what you, for the moment, simply called 'The Shift.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As I scanned your once tranquil neighborhood, a middle aged man sat by one of these wrecked cars, sulking like a teenage girl. A 35 year old woman's body, a womanly body I knew to be a certain Holly Stewart, a single mother to her young daughter, sat legs wide open, playing with a few dolls looked otherwise confused. All the while, her daughter, Trisha Stewart, spoke maturely to someone over a phone, attempting to figure out what happened. The body of a teenage girl, a girl who looked to be no older than 13, walked about, smiling at the chaos, laughing in triumph. What was happening, I knew not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     But, despite what was happening, I turned to face the door, taking another deep breath in and out. All the setting, all the situation did was make me more fearful, sending various thoughts racing through my mind. \"What would happen to us, to me, after this? What if Mom isn't herself? What if she freaks out, and kicks me out, or something, doesn't believe me?\" Eventually, I snapped out of this paranoia and promptly knocked on the door, as rapidly as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     There stood silence for only a moment, before the familiar voice of your mother, Linda, entered, sounding as if she stood right at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Who... Who is it?\" Mom asked, her voice firm, yet, clearly a bit scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"...\" I hesitated in answering for a moment. \"Mom?\" I started. \"Mom, it's me, Evan! I know it doesn't sound like me... But, you've gotta believe me.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Immediately afterwards, after the sounds of a few locks twisting and turning, the door opened, revealing my mother, wearing a pair of jeans, sneakers and a blouse. She looked as if she was prepared, ready to go if she needed to. She scanned me from my head of shiny, womanly hair to my toes, painted a certain shade of red. Without hesitation, she threw her arms open and took me into her embrace, her embrace, though still warm and motherly, a bit more awkward, considering that we both had fully developed breasts, and were both women.<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n     \"Evan, Evan, Evan...\" She warmly whispered. \"Thank goodness you're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Thanks, Mom. I'm glad you're okay, too.\" I smiled, returning her hug. \"But, how'd you know it was me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She let me go, grasped my shoulders, and looked me in the eyes. \"Believe me, a mother knows her child when she hears them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Mom, too, looked at the grim, dire looking surroundings and held the door open. \"C'mon inside, honey. Better get inside where it's safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      I wasted no time in taking up her offer and making my way inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I've just been... Y'know, trying to stay updated on this, this... Whatever it is.\" Mom explained, sitting on the couch in the living room, sipping a coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Any luck on the TV?\" I asked, reaching for the remote and switching it on, only to find static accompanied by the loud, obnoxious blur of noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"... I think that answers your question, about the TV...\" Mom answered as I smiled, content in knowing my Mom had retained her sarcasm in these strange days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I've been using this old radio we had in the attic...\" Mom pulled out an old looking radio, looking as if it was in the 90's or something. She switched it on before whispering \"Listen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     A few moments of static were present before a clear voice entered. The voice of a woman, presumably in her 20's. Both myself and Mom listened attentively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"... In case you're just tuning in.\" The woman over the radio began, an air of confidence about her. \"Despite the sound of my voice, this is your news anchor Brian Wilson speaking to you from radio 99.7, now in the body of a young woman.\" Brian paused. I giggled a bit inside, knowing that the big, strong Brian Wilson, a local celebrity, was now in the body of a petite sounding young woman. Anyway, Brian continued, in her voice sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"...And, I am one of the thousands upon thousands of victims affected by what scientists are calling, \"The Great Shift.\" He paused an ominous pause, accompanied by the sounds of papers shuffling. \"According to reports, it would seem that, for reasons still unknown, approximately 90% of the population has switched bodies, like right out of a Sci-Fi story. People of all ages, genders, ethnicities and backgrounds, now suddenly filling each other's shoes... According to recent broadcasts around the globe, we do believe that this phenomenon has affected much of the globe... This just in... It would seem that shifts are not necessarily two-sided, patterns being spontaneous... As of yet, higher powers are still attempting to figure out a way to return to normalcy, if possible... It is currently unknown whether or not this is an isolated incident or if 'after shocks,' like an earthquake, are to occur.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Mom looked to me with a look of concern about her, then back to the radio as the voice returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"... For more updates as they become known, stay tuned to radio 99.7... Until then, here's Emily Abel with what you need to know about 'The Great Shift...'\" Just then, the voice of a young, pre-teen sounding boy entered, clearing his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Thanks, Brian...\" Emily, in his newfound voice began before Mom turned the radio off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, I guess I'm one of the lucky ones, huh?\" Mom asked, looking to you, a small smile on her face. \"Who's body are you in anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     I rolled my eyes before answering. \"One of my teachers, Ms. Cunningham...\" I sighed, gesturing to my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Pretty cute, huh?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Mom.\" You sternly began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Right...\" Mom said. \"You should probably change into something more comfortable. I've been meaning to go out and look for your sister, but, I was waiting for all the chaos out there to cool down a bit. I know it sounds bad, me just sitting here, but, it was crazy out there. Car crashes and people losing it everywhere! Plus, now that you're here you can watch my back, and, I can watch yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That's right, Corrine.\" You gasped, Corrine coming to mind. All I could wonder was how scared she must be, that, and, who's body she may be in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Where do we even begin, Mom?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I think the best place to start is your school. I'm not sure how we'll look for her, or, anything, but, we have to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"But, don't you think that she'll head over here, instinctively? I did, and now we're together. I think that we should just sit tight for a little while. If she doesn't show up after some time, then we leave.\" I insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But, how long would we end up waiting, Evan?!\" Mom frantically cried. \"What if, by the time we act, it's too late?! People are crazy, Evan, who knows what'll happen to her?\" Mom cried, nearly to tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Okay, fine... If we leaves we should leave now. But, I think that we should just sit here for a bit and wait. She's a smart girl, Corrine. You have to trust that she'll know what to do and come home. On the other hand... if you really want to leave, we should leave soon, as soon as possible, before night comes. I'll leave it up to you. You are the mom, after all. When I come back down stairs, I hope you've made up your mind.\" I trudged upstairs, my heels clicking and clacking as I did, leaving mom to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It was strange, my speaking skills out together with Ms. Cunningham's voice and body mad emu sound like a real teacher. Anyway, I opened the closet and examined my options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Mom's sure got a ton of clothes... Let's see...\" I browsed through each hanger, each nook and cranny of the vast walk-in closet. After a bit of browsing, and after considering how hot it was outside, I eventually settled for a light blue colored, sleeveless dress that went a few inches above the knees. That along with a pair of heeled sandals. I would have settled for something less feminine, but, Mom was a very feminine woman, dresses, skirts and all were her wardrobe. After quickly looking myself over in the full body mirror, liking what I saw, but, disliking the fact that it was me in the mirror, I waltzed out to see Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Back in the living room, Mom sat on the couch, in thought, playing and fiddling with the switches on the radio. She looked to me, a small smile about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You... You look great, son!\" Mom smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I don't think 'son' fits me in this body...\" The two of us shared a laugh, before I looked her way once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So, what do we do about Corrine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I've decided... After a little more thought, I think it's best that we...\"</span></div></div>",

As I threw her a puzzled look, she began to defend her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I know it's dangerous out there. Looting, violence, women being violated, according to the radio...\" Mom continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     I cut her off right there. \"See, that's why we have to stay here, where it's safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"No! That's why we have to go out there and look for her ourselves! We can't just leave her out there and hope she'll be fine! It's way too crazy out there to simply hope, we have to take action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She did have a point. I took a deep sigh and finally admitted defeat. \"Fine!\" I said. \"Maybe we can build a bigger group out there, too. The more the better, people probably won't mess with us if we have more people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"And you have to stay close to me at all times.\" Mom demanded. \"You're a woman now, like it or not. And you know what people, sick people, want from women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I know.\" I cringed at the thought, knowing full well what Mom spoke of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Now, get in the car. I'll drive. We have to be fast in getting there! The radio has been going on about all sorts of car theft out there. People will do crazy things for a ride.\" Mom held the door open, waving her keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I'd imagine...\" I agreed, walking out the door, meeting with the strange world outside the home. It truly was a strange new world, all within a matter of seconds, possibly shorter. The whole thing resembled \"War of the Worlds,\" or something. Anyway, I stepped into the passenger seat of the car as Mom hopped into the driver's seat, quickly starting the car and closing the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Just then, Mom and I let out a small shriek as a viciously loud slam erupted from Mom's side of the car. We both looked to the source of the noise, only to find a rather large man, strong and looking rather frightening, beating at Mom's window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Get out of the car... Get out of the car...!\" He demanded in his gruff voice as he beat on Mom's window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Step on it!\" I called as Mom briskly set the car to 'reverse' and slammed her foot on the gas, maneuvering out of the driveway, then proceeding forward towards my school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The car ride remained mostly silent, the only noises being the sounds of static from the radio, every now and again, updates on this 'Great Shift' could be heard. \"Again...\" The voice of Emily Abel, now in the body of a pre-teen boy, continued. \"...It is strongly advised that all remain in their homes until further notice. Repeat, do not leave your homes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Mom turned the radio off right there. \"Well, I guess that makes you and I a couple of rebels, huh?\" Mom laughed, you attempted to join in, offering a small giggle and a soft smile. The fear of what had become of your sister, your friends, continued to infect your mind as some ravenous disease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Well, looks like we're here.\" Mom said as she parked the car along a curb in front of the school. A curb that stood directly in front of the school. Mom mentioned that actually parking in the parking lot during something like this would prove useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Okay... I guess we should get going.\" I looked to Mom as we both stepped out of the car, making our way to the front of the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Cautiously, the two of us entered the school, the setting eerie as can be. The power was mostly out, all except a few lights flickering. Signs were torn down, doors beaten off hinges, all sorts of writings sprawled along walls, a few crosses painted among the walls. Clearly some believed this was a matter of God, I rolled my eyes at the thought, never having been the religious type. A few people, of various bodies, ages, genders passed by, some scared looking, some happy, and some with a certain curiosity about their new bodies. But, I deemed these people to be not dangerous, so, Mom and I paid them no mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"So, which class did your sister have when all this happened?\" Mom asked you, attempting to keep her voice down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Gym. I'll show you, it's straight down the hall. C'mon.\" I gestured that Mom follow me straight down the long, seemingly infinite hallway that grew creepier and creepier with each step. It got darker and darker as we continued, the light coming in through the doors fading, fading. Lights flickered, evidence of chaos continued to grow more prominent as we walked. Finally, we neared the gym, whose double doors were completely beaten down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The walls surrounding the gym entrance, once proudly decorated in the schools awards, logos and other sports related memorabilia now stood bare, glass shattered and walls smeared.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n     \"What's going on in there...?\" Mom asked as the two of us stood at some distance away from the gym.so entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You... You hear that?\" I asked, listening closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah... Sounds like a riot.\" Mom whispered, noting the sounds of all sorts of yelling, chaos, things being thrown. Heck, even from where the two of us stood, the silhouettes of what looked like a mosh-pit could be made out. All sorts of blurs and shadows beating on each other, throwing whatever they could only to deal damage. It truly was a horrifying sight, I could make out the distinct sight of dread in Mom's eyes as she looked forward, towards the riot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What if Corrine's in there?! What do we do?! We have to act now!\" Mom panicked, holding her hands to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"We'll get in there, we just need a plan... The only thing is that... There's no alternate entrance. That's the only one to get in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"So, how do we get in?\" Mom inquired as a trash can flew out of the doors of the gym and onto the floor, spilling its contents all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"...There's no way we can avoid it. The best way to do it is to stay along the walls and be quick... The locker rooms, which might be safe, might...\" I emphasized the 'might.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"... Well, let's go, then.\" Mom gulped, extending her hand as if gesturing that you hold on.

You heard the news, there's no way of telling who's who since most of the swaps aren't two way.  We'd be wasting energy on something we don't know anything about.\"<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess you're right.  There's so much chaos out there right now that I wouldn't even know what to do or how to do it.  Not to mention driving is still kind of scary...\"<br>\r\n\"That's so unfair!  I haven't been able to drive yet!  Hell, I haven't even left the house yet.\" Ryan remarked.<br>\r\n\"Trust me, you'd be best to avoid that madness right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI notice my skirt's really uncomfortable in this position, so I readjust it.  Man, wearing this skirt suit really makes life more difficult than it should to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over at Ryan and noticed mom has the same basic shape and body size as Ms. Cunningham, if only slightly chubbier.

Although now, I have that body lots of women would love to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at what I was wearing. A pink tank top, denim jeans, and light blue flats. For a mom, she knew how to dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first I didn't mind it. I didn't want to go to school, so now I can just lie in my bed, or my moms bed. I loved the idea of sleeping in my moms bed. Hers was the most comfy. Plus I could even wear one of her silky nightgowns. I hear those are really comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I got a change to go into my moms room, I saw people outside were scared, confused, and panicking. I went outside to see what the fuss was about, and saw our neighbor, Mr. Bonham, even more confused, hugging his daughters Barbie doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Bonham, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at me, scared, tears in his eyes. \"Ms. Evans Mommy!\" he said. \"For some reason I'm my daddy!

I then look over at Mr. Bonham's daughter, he was looking at his new body's hands and smiling, waving it around his face and slowly feeling his body. Perverted old man, I can't believe he would do this to his own daughter.

Then suddenly there  was a knock on the door and I look outside of my parents room and see</span></div></div>",

Your Mom never let you go to sleep in just your boxer's, it was aways something you wanted to try. You finished removing your bra and looked in the full mirror.  It was such a curious thing being in your Mom's body.  You gently touch your new breasts, only slightly saggy with age, but still full.  They were so soft, something you've aways wanted to experience, but you were never in an intimate relationship with a woman. Now you seemed to be stuck in a very intimate one with your Mom.  You feel as though you should be freaking out but you're not.  It just feels so right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were entranced in your new body, feeling the small slit that was there in place of your junk, but then you remembered you were tired. There would be plenty of time to discover what happened to you and everybody else, but for right now, no better time to sleep.  You slowly walk toward 'your' new Queen sized bed, aware of the new sway in your hips, jiggle on our chest. Every movement seemed foreign to you, and you definitely wouldn't get used to smelling like your Mom's perfume, that is for certain.  You move the soft covers off the bed, and slide into it, covering yourself. It was such a good feeling.  You think back and remember the last time you got into this bed.  Sometime when you were eight and you and a nightmare.  Now you're back again, and it all felt like some strange dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, your tired mind, trying to process all of this, simply goes black, giving you weird, vivid dreams.  Your Mom's wedding, and how happy she was, her honeymoon, giving birth, all flood into your mind.  These must be your mom's memories, you figured out. It was calming and comfortable, being naked under the covers of this comfy bed, when...</span></div></div>",

Yeah, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek and I talked for a few minutes, updating each other on what had happened.  It turned out that Derek and his mom had swapped bodies, his dad had swapped with their 27-year-old next door neighbor Kelly Conrad and his sister, Corinne's best friend, had swapped bodies with the captain of the boy's basketball team.  \"Have you heard from Jake at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he called a little while ago.  He's in Miranda Keyes body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda Keyes was the captain of the cheerleading squad; a girl who Jake had a crush on.  \"Really!?  That's surprising, because Corinne is in his body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not all.  He said that Kevin had swapped bodies with his mom, while his dad and sister had swapped with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was Jake's older brother, I hung out with him occasionally.  I was about to say something when the oven signaled that it was preheated.  \"Listen Derek, I have to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay safe man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was ready a short time later.  Sitting down at the table, we all took our share of the pizza and started eating.  Between mouthfuls, we came up with a plan for the next few days.  Amanda would stay here for the time being; to help dad adapt to her body and being an expectant mother.  After that we came up with the sleeping arraignments; dad would sleep in mom's bed because it's Tempur-Pedic mattress would alleviate the strain on his new pregnant body.  Meanwhile mom would sleep in my bed and Corinne would sleep in hers.  That left Amanda and I, to our embarrassment, sleeping together on the pull-out couch in the family room.</span></div></div>",

Walking over to the porch swing, I placed my coffee in the cup holder and sat down.  Looking over the fence, I saw storm clouds in the distance.  I was startled when I heard Amanda say, \"Looks like we're in for a storm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, I saw Amanda walking out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee in her hands.  \"Yeah, its supposed to be pretty bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting next to me, Amanda says, \"It's a good thing your friends all live close by; with all the crashes yesterday, and the storm, they might be here a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek and I had made plans for all the families to gather at my house; to discuss what was happening.  It would be interesting to see how Kevin and Derek were adapting to their new bodies.  \"They're not coming over till later; the storm might be done by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda took a sip of her coffee, just as I lit a cigarette.  \"I didn't know you smoked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't.\" taking a puff, I said, \"It's one of my mom's nasty habits that I seem to have acquired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Amanda says, \"I hope you're not upset with me about earlier; I had no idea I was doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm not mad.  It wasn't your fault or anything.\" gesturing to the cigarette, I said, \"These bodies are making us act differently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finished the cigarette a few minutes later and started on the coffee.  While I took a sip, Amanda says, \"I know we just met and everything.\" looking at me, she says, \"But I'm here if you...need help adapting to your new body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.  I could use all the help I can get.\" looking at, Amanda, I said, \"Seeing how I went from being a 17-year-old boy to a 37-year-old woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next surprised me.  Amanda placed her arm around my neck and pulled me closer; until my head was resting on her shoulder.  I would've pulled away but, for some reason, I felt safe.  It was as if all my worries went away; knowing that Amanda was protecting me.  Looking at me, she says, \"We'll get through this together, Evan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stayed like that for a few minutes until we heard a low rumble in the distance.  Grabbing our things, we went inside just as the rain started.  Looking at the clock, I said, \"We should get started on breakfast; the others will be awake soon.\"</span></div></div>",

With Amanda's help, I cleaned up the kitchen before excusing myself to take a shower.  Walking by the den, on the way to the stairs, I saw Mom and Corinne talking with dad.  Seeing the three of them smiling, and laughing, I said, \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>Maybe Amanda was right; we will get through this.</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into my mom's bathroom a few minutes later and closed the door.  After closing the blinds, so no one would see me naked, I got undressed.  While waiting for the water to warm up, I walked over to the mirror and looked at my reflection.  Seeing my mom's naked body staring back at me made me a little nervous; I was about to take a shower while in my mom's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, to calm myself, I said, \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>It's alright Evan, it's only a shower.</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling calmer, I stepped into the shower and closed the door.  The first thing I noticed was that my mom's body was <i>much</i> more sensitive then my own; the water sending waves of pleasure through my body as it hit.  I spent a few minutes leaning against the wall, letting the pleasure flow through me.  After a few minutes, I finally got around to showering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the next 20 minutes doing my usual shower routine; hair, skin, hands and feet.  Once I rinsed the soap off, believing I was finished, I was about to get out of the shower when I felt the urge to shave my legs.  Looking down I saw that I had a couple days worth of growth on my leg.  Acting purely on instinct, I grabbed my mom's razor and started shaving.  I shaved until I was satisfied with how my legs felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, I got out of the shower and proceeded to dry off.  Grabbing a towel I wrapped it around; the incorrect way for a girl, and proceeded to dry off.  Having learned that woman pat themselves dry; I did that.  I had just finished drying off when there was a knock at the door.  Nervous, I said, \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Amanda; can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh, I don't think that's a good idea.\" pausing, I said, \"I'm kind of naked at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax.\" opening the door, Amanda says, \"You don't have anything I haven't...Whoa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, I said, \"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.  It's just that,\" pointing to the towel, Amanda says, \"If I was really a guy I would've gotten a great view of your chest; with the way you have the towel wrapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with it? This is how I always wrap it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would work if you were still a guy.  But,\" rearranging the towel, Amanda says, \"You're a woman now; and it's inappropriate to not cover your chest with a towel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Thanks.\" blushing, I looked at Amanda and said, \"I doubt you came up just for that; what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would need some help with your hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Amanda's help, I spent the next 20 minutes blow drying and brushing my hair.  Once it was finished, I looked at her and said, \"Thanks for the help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.  Like I said earlier,\" pausing, Amanda says, \"You and I had the most drastic change; we need to help each other whenever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" catching a whiff of something, I said, \"My first piece of advice; use some deodorant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.  Well I'll let you get dressed in private.  Although,\" smiling, Amanda says, \"You're already attractive just the way you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why I just said that!? It just happened.\"  Blushing, Amanda says, \"I-I should go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amanda reached for the door knob, I said, \"Hey, wait a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda stopped and looked at me.  She was about to say something when, to my surprise, I leaned in and kissed her on the lips.  After her initial shock wore off, Amanda started kissing back.  We spent the next few minutes kissing, with Amanda's hands moving up till they were resting on my cheeks.  I couldn't remember a time when I felt happier; until I heard Amanda say, \"Evan?  Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes and saw Amanda staring at me with a confused look on her face.  \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright? You kind of zoned out for a couple minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>Weren't we just kissing!?</i></span>\" Looking at her, I said, \"Y-yeah, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  Call me if you need any help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Amanda left, I walked back into the bedroom to get dressed.  While putting on the bra and panties, I thought to myself, \"What's happening to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finished getting dressed a short time later; in a similar outfit to the one I wore yesterday.  As I walked downstairs, hearing a loud rumble of thunder, I realized that the others wouldn't be getting here for another couple hours.  Realizing that, I decided to watch the news.</span></div></div>",

Switching to the local station, I failed to notice that I'd once again crossed my legs without thinking.  Turning up the volume I listened as a girl in her mid-teens started speaking.  \"Welcome back to the 9:00 news, I'm Kevin Thompson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw dropped when I heard that; because prior to the shift Kevin Thompson had been a balding man in his mid-40s.  \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>Wow, and I thought I had it bad.</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the TV, I listened as Kevin continued.  \"It has been 24 hours since the world came to a stand still in the aftermath of what scientists are calling 'The Great Shift.' 95% of the world lost consciousness and found themselves in unfamiliar bodies.\" pausing, she says, \"I myself woke up to find myself in the body of my 17 year old niece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to listen as Kevin spoke about how riots broke out in every major city around the world.  I was still watching the news when my dad walked into the room.  \"Mind if I join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, have a seat.\" Looking at him, I saw that he was wearing different clothes then the ones he'd arrived in yesterday.  \"Where'd you get the new clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I borrowed them from Corinne; seeing how she'll probably not be needing them anymore.\" sitting down, he says, \"They're a little snug around my stomach, but its better than nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering the volume, I turned to dad and said, \"I want to apologize for how Corinne and I acted yesterday.  With everything that happened, we let our emotions get the better of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to apologize, Evan.  I expected that to happen when I decided to come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued to talk until I heard Kevin mention that the President would be speaking momentarily.  Muting the TV, I yelled, \"Guys! Come into the family room, the President is about to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone came into the room and took a seat just as the view switched to the White House.  We all patiently waited for the President to enter the room.  When he did, we saw that he'd been affected by the switch as well; having swapped bodies with his wife Michelle.  I turned up the volume as he walked up to the podium.  \"My fellow Americans; I come before you as the world experiences an event unprecedented in human history.  95% of the world's population found themselves 'shifted' into a different body.  As you can see, I was 'shifted' into the body of my wife Michelle.  My daughters were similarly affected; with Malia and Sasha having 'shifted' into each other's bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe President continued to speak; about how the world would need to adapt to the change.  He said that the world's best scientists are attempting to figure out how exactly the Shift occurred; but stopped short of saying that he hopes to reverse it.  He also said that schools and businesses would remain closed for the next week; as we figure out where to go from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned off the TV after the President's speech ended.  Looking at the others, I said, \"So it looks like we're going to staying home for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all talked amongst ourselves until we heard the doorbell ring.  Realizing that would the others, I got up to answer the door.</span></div></div>",

Knowing it wasn't really his mom, I said, \"How are you, Derek?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good; considering I'm now in my mom's body.\" pausing, he says, \"How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could use a cigarette, but otherwise I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cigarette?  You don't smoke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying hello to Derek, I proceeded to say hello to everyone else.  Everyone was pretty shaken up by what happened, especially Jake.  Looking at me, he says, \"This isn't what I met when I said I wanted to get to know Miranda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you heard from her at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah; she's in Ms. Cunningham's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Cunningham was my homeroom teacher; an attractive 25-year-old.  \"She might see that as a step up; considering Ms. Cunningham used to be a model.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I came to Kevin, I was surprised by what I saw.  Kevin was on the football team; a real jock; so I was surprised to see him wearing a skirt skirt with his hair in a bun.  \"Uh...Nice outfit Kevin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask me why.  But,\" Blushing, Kevin says, \"My mom insisted I wear this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you Kevin.  I'm a business woman and,\" Kevin's mom, in his mom, walked up and said, \"You know I don't dress casually very often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom, its embarrassing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to stop this before this got out of hand; I said, \"Can you guys talk about this some other time?  Everyone else is waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone walked into the family room.  Expecting Jake to be in her body, Corinne was shocked to see that her body wasn't present.  \"If Jake isn't in my body; then who is!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure that out later.\" looking at her, I said, \"I think its best if we all just relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we do that.\" Looking at Derek and me, Kevin says, \"Can I have a moment with Evan and Derek please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone else talked amongst themselves, I led Kevin and Derek into the sun room.  After closing the door, I sat down across from Kevin and Derek.  Neither of us noticed that we'd crossed our legs without thinking.  Looking at Kevin, I said, \"So what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to see how you two are holding up.  The three of us are probably dealing with the most drastic 'shift' of anyone here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't go that far.\" thinking of Amanda, I said, \"Amanda went from being a 23-year-old expectant mother to being a 37 year old guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Kevin and me, Derek says, \"I'm still in shock about all this; finding myself in my mom's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing I can't stop thinking about, is what we're going to do if this is permanent?\" looking at Derek and me, Kevin says, \"Do we go back to school like nothing happened; acting like we're not woman in our mid-30s?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was actually giving that some thought while I was in the shower this morning.\" looking at Kevin and Derek, I said, \"What if we don't go back to school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would we do then?  I certainly don't know how to be an obstetrician.\" looking at Kevin and I, Derek says, \"How about you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know the first thing about managing a bank.\" looking at me, Kevin says, \"I highly doubt you know much about being a lawyer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen guys.  I know that wouldn't be the <i>ideal</i> choice.\" pausing, I said, \"But it may come to that in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us talked for a few minutes before Kevin mentioned we should go back to talking with the others.  On the way into the kitchen, I smirked and said, \"You look good in heels, Kevin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're laughing now.\" looking at me, he says, \"Just wait till you're wearing them.\"</span></div></div>",

After we'd all taken turns speaking, we started talking about where we'd go from here.

I was embarrassed to admit it; but I'd gotten quite good at walking in heels.  Not only that, I could do my own makeup without making a mess.  It was Friday afternoon, around 3:30, and I was in the kitchen washing dishes.  That was another of my mom's lessons; she thought I'd adapt better if I started doing her chores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house was quite; with only Amanda and I home at the moment.  Corinne and mom went with Dad to check out Amanda's apartment; which Amanda gave my dad permission to live in for the moment.  They'd called a little earlier to say that they'd be spending the night there; since the nationwide curfew started at 4:00.  I had just finished loading the dishwasher when Amanda walked into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, she says, \"You've been pretty quite since the others left.  Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" turning on the dishwasher, I looked at Amanda and said, \"I'm just thinking about how much things have changed in the last few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean besides the Shift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" pausing, I said, \"In the span of 4 days, I went from being a 17-year-old guy to a 37-year-old woman who can do her own makeup and walk in heels without tripping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize you just referred to yourself as 'her,' right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was bound to happen sooner or later.  Don't get me wrong, I want nothing more to be a guy again.\" pausing, I said, \"It's just that its difficult not to think of myself as a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us talked for a few minutes before Amanda says, \"I have the perfect solution to your problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" smiling, I said, \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could...have sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda!? You can't be serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear me out, okay?\" pausing, Amanda says, \"We're both under <i>a lot</i> of stress after what happened; and sex has been known to alleviate stress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that.  It's just...weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand you don't want to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I didn't say that.  I just said it was weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to pressure you or anything; we don't have to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the 2 of us were upstairs in my mom's bedroom; with lit candles everywhere and a bottle of wine chilling by the bedside.  Looking around, I said, \"Isn't this a bit overkill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" looking at me, she says, \"I want this to be memorable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay; whatever you say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike in so many romance movies, Amanda and I got undressed and climbed into bed.  Amanda poured us both a glass of wine, after which we had a toast.  \"A toast...too new experiences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the toast we took a sip of the wine before placing on the night stand.  We started things out slowly; by kissing.  After a few minutes we slowly sped things up.  It wasn't long before we were having full blown sex.  I was glad we were the only ones in the house; because I would've died of embarrassment had anyone heard us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were basking in the afterglow 30 minutes later.  Rolling over onto Amanda's stomach, trying to catch my breath, I said, \"That (gasp) was amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was definitely (gasp) interesting to experience sex (gasp) from the guys perspective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling off Amanda, I leaned over to retrieve our wine glasses.  While I was doing that, Amanda started kissing my neck.  \"That feels good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing off what was in our glasses, Amanda looked at me and said, \"You feeling up for another round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer apprehensive about having sex as a woman, I smiled and said, \"I am if you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had sex for almost an hour before we finally became to tired to proceed.  As we snuggled together under the sheets, Amanda said, \"I just realized we didn't use a condom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no big deal.\" looking at her, I said, \"My next period is 2 weeks away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Amanda says, \"How could you possibly know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" It was then that I realized I had not idea how I knew that.  Looking at her, I said, \"I-I just do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully both of us were too tired, both from the wine and the sex, to discuss it further.  We both fell asleep in each others arms and slept for a few hours before waking up.  Still tired from the sex, we had some snacks before going to bed...in separate beds.</span></div></div>",

After thinking for a minute, I reluctantly climbed out of bed and walked into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the shower, letting the water run down my back, my thoughts went to the events of the previous night.  Experiencing sex as a woman was the most amazing thing I'd ever felt; but part of me wondered if it was a bad idea.  I got out of the shower 15 minutes later and dried off.  Walking back into the bedroom, I got dressed to go downstairs.  Wearing pants and a tank top, I was walking towards the door when I had the sudden urge to put on some makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back into the bathroom, I spent the next 10 minutes applying the makeup; as if I'd done it for years.

Hearing the sound of someone pouring cereal into a bowl, I walked into the kitchen.  I saw Amanda sitting at the table, eating a bowl of Frosted Flakes.  Grabbing a bowl from the cabinet, I sat down and poured myself a bowl.  Looking at me, Amanda says, \"Are you wearing makeup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am.\" blushing, I said, \"Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\" looking at me, Amanda says, \"It makes you look...attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Amanda says, \"I'd have to be blind not to think you're attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't that surprise you though; considering you used to be a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  But,\" pausing, Amanda says, \"I'll add that to the list of surprises since the Shift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us ate in silence for a while, until I said, \"I-I think we should talk about last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so to.\" Looking at me, Amanda says, \"What's on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think i-it would be a good idea if we waited before doing it again.\"  Taking a deep breath, practically whispering,I said, \"That way, we know for certain what we really want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking that we shouldn't have done it all.\" Looking at me, Amanda says, \"I know that might sound hurtful but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.\" Interrupting her, I said, \"You might be right about that, but...we can't change the fact that we had sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?  Do we just move on?\" pausing, Amanda looks at me and says, \"Evan, we shared something incredible last night.  No matter what we decide, you and I will always have that intimate connection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her, albeit reluctantly, I said, \"I think it'd be best if we moved on.\" looking at her, I said, \"At least until we figure things out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a gentle tone, Amanda says, \"Are we...good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" giving Amanda's hand a gentle squeeze, I said, \"We're good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging the subject, Amanda says, \"So whats the plan for today?  Corinne and your parents won't be back until later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\" finishing the bowl of cereal, I said, \"I thought I'd do a little housework; the house hasn't been dusted in a while and the floors need to be vacuumed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Amanda says, \"I can't help but notice you're acting more and more like a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was bound to happen sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the two of us went off to do our own thing; Amanda went to try to get in touch with her family while I went to get the vacuum cleaner.

Since coming home from Amanda's apartment, a few hours earlier, Mom and I had spent the afternoon teaching me to be a woman.  Mom had just finished teaching me, to my embarrassment, about feminine hygiene.  Listening to her describe what a period feels like, I looked at her and said, \"It's not <i>that</i> bad, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can depend.  But,\" looking at me, with a hint of sorrow in her eyes, Mom says, \"I've had some bad ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I highly doubt I'll get used to them anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt the same way when they first started; but I eventually good used to them.\"  pausing, Mom says, \"I'm sure you'll get used to them in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Periods.\" sighing, I look at mom and say, \"Just another sign that I'm not a boy anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's move onto something a little less embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be necessary for you to dress professionally while in public.  So,\" Standing up, Mom walks over to the closet and says, \"I'll teach you how to put on nylons and a skirt suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing my mom take out a rose color skirt suit (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www5.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?GrpTyp=SIZ&amp;ItemID=1aa5989&amp;DeptID=70656&amp;CatID=71648&amp;SO=0&amp;SelDim=5~623&amp;x5view=1&amp;Ne=623+29+3+1031+8+18+904+833+949&amp;shopperType=G&amp;N=4294953661+4294964433&amp;Nao=0&amp;PSO=0&amp;CmCatId=70656%7C71648\" target=\"_blank\">http://www5.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?Grp...</a>), I said, \"You can't be serious!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan.\" Carrying the suit over to the bed, Mom says, \"If you're going to live my life; then you need to dress the part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn shock, I looked at my mom and said, \"What makes you think I want to live your life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you expect me to believe that you're planning to go back to school in the body of your 37 year old mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thought of living your life had crossed my mind.  But,\" looking at her, I said, \"How did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my son, Evan.  You've never been one to back away from a challenge.\" pausing, Mom sits down next to me and says, \"I can't think of anything more challenging for a you; then to live the rest of your life as a 37-year-old mother of 2.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, I said, \"I never could get anything past you; could I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.  Don't worry about Derek or Kevin,\"  pausing, she says, \"I talked to their mom's yesterday and they told me that they were considering the same decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's one small problem with this plan, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at mom, I said, \"I don't know how to be a lawyer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then.\"  chuckling, Mom says, \"It's a good thing I kept all my books from law school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom's office downstairs had about 2 dozen law books.  Looking at her, I said, \"You expect me to read <i>all</i> those books in a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Federal Government had declared that all businesses would stay closed for one week; while everyone figures out where to go from there.  Looking at me, she says, \"You can do it.  Besides, Derek and Kevin are in the same situation.\" pausing, Mom says, \"They have a week to learn how to do their mom's jobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case.\" smiling, I said, \"There's only one thing left to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What might that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing to the skirt suit, I said, \"Put on the suit and see how I look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me. Oh,\" pausing, mom says, \"Don't worry about your dad and sister finding out; you can tell them when you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.  I have to figure out how I'm going to tell them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were you, I'd keep quite about you having sex with Amanda last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" shocked, I looked at mom and said, \"How'd you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sex gives off a certain smell.  You two were the only ones home last night, so I knew who was responsible.\"  folding her arms, Mom looks at me and says, \"So, how was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the next 10 minutes describing, in detail, how it felt having sex as a woman.  When I was finished, I said, \"It was amazing, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you enjoyed it.  I must say,\" pausing, mom says, \"That's one of the things I'll miss about being a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, with mom's instructions, I was able to put on the nylons and the skirt suit without much trouble.  After quickly doing my hair, placing over one shoulder, Mom helped me into the heels and led me to the mirror.  Stunned by my appearance, I said, \"Is that...me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's you.  Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it.\" smiling, I said, \"I look...professional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get used to that look, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and I stood in front of the mirror for a few minutes before she decided I should get undressed.  While getting undressed, I looked at mom and said, \"Something has been bothering me, lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean besides your sex change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" pausing, I said, \"I've being doing things, without thinking, that I've never done before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smoking, for instance.\" pausing, I said, \"This morning I noticed I crossed my legs without thinking about it; and I had the urge to clean the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you've been smoking because I did it.  You're being flooded with new hormones; which would explain you crossing your legs.  And as for cleaning the house,\" chuckling, Mom says, \"You've always been a bit of a neat freak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter changing back into some casual clothes, Mom and I walked downstairs to spend time with the others.</span></div></div>",

Mom had spent the last 5 days cramming 4 years of law school into my mind; and I was confident that I would hold my own in the court room.  A lot had happened in the last few days, with each of us deciding to keep the names of the bodies they now occupied.  There were a few changes, for example; Corinne was now going by Cory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 5:25 in the evening and I was in my room getting ready for dinner at Grace and Brian's house (formerly Kevin and his sister Marcie).

I wasn't disturbed this time; for one <i>important</i> reason...this was my body now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter standing in front of the mirror for a few minutes, I proceeded to get dressed.

I didn't see them at Linda's house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're over at my old house, spending some time with their dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the three of them had some more drinks; until Kyle excused himself to use the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later, Kyle was leaving the bathroom when he saw me on the porch having a cigarette.  Walking onto the porch, he says, \"Mind if I join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at him, I said, \"Sure, have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting next to me, Kyle says, \"The guys and I were talking about what it's like to have families; it depressed me a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah; I know how you feel.  I was talking about that with Grace and Tonya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Kyle says, \"I want you to know that my decision has nothing to do with you, Linda.  I love you very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you to, Kyle.  Why can't you see that we're meant to be together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know we're meant to be together.  I just don't want to risk hurting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that what a relationship is? A risk?\" looking at Kyle, I said, \"I know you're worried that you'll turn out like my father and leave when things get tough; but you're <i>not</i> my father, Kyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us sat on that bench for almost 1/2 an hour; talking to each other.  After a while, Kyle looked at me and said, \"Would it make you happy if I agreed to stay on a trial basis? I'll stay for a month and, if things aren't working out then I'll leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by working out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, our relationship started after a beer-induced night of passion.  If, in a month, we realize that we're not in love with each other; then I'll move out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" pausing, I said, \"I can agree to those terms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a nice dinner with friends, during which Kyle and I were congratulated on working things out, Kyle and I said good bye and went home.  Cory and Evan were asleep by then, since it was 11:30, so Kyle and I quietly went upstairs to my room.  Having had a little to much to drink, Kyle and I got undressed and started making out.  We never realized that we'd forgotten a condom as the two of us made love.</span></div></div>",

In the weeks after the shift, I established myself as a lawyer who enthusiastically represented her clients.  Due to the Shift having affected everyone world wide, there was very little chance of prosecuting a crime that occurred prior to the Shift; as the criminals were either in new bodies, or dead, as a result of the Shift.  The cases I handled primarily involved crimes that occurred in the aftermath of the Shift; looting, armed robbery and the occasional murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friends and family adjusted to their lives as well; some of us more than others.  I was surprised to learn, about 2 weeks after the Shift, that Cory was dating Marcie.  Things started to heat up between Miranda and Evan, and they soon became a couple as well.  We eventually found Cory's old body; now occupied by a 78 year old man.  Sam and Corinne, as she was calling herself now, started dating about 3 weeks after the Shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace and Brian eventually decided to sleep with each other; forever ending their past relationship as brother and sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was dealing with changes as well.  Starting about a week ago; I'd been throwing up every morning.  On top of that, my period was a week late.  Putting two and two together; I went to Tonya's office for a check up.  After spending a few hours at her office, waiting for results, I was finally on my way home.  Today was the deadline Kyle and I had set to see if our relationship would last; and I was hoping my test results were persuade him to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got home a short time after leaving Tonya's office.  Pulling into the drive, I saw that Cory and Evan were playing basketball in the driveway.  Seeing me, Cory says, \"Hi mom, how'd it go at the doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you two later, okay?\" pausing, I said, \"Do me a favor and stay out here for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the house, I saw Kyle standing in the kitchen.  Seeing me, he says, \"How'd it go at Tonya's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to control myself, I said, \"Let's just say, I'm hopeful that you're going to stick around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" a smile on his face, Kyle says, \"Might I ask why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Kyle, I said, \"I'm pregnant.\"</span></div></div>",

You hated it with such intensity, you always tried to hide for your mother when she would go looking for you. Too bad she would always find you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Mikey looks a little happier. \"What do you don't like?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Washing your hair and getting soap in your eye and then it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burns, you really don't like it too.\" Mikey says  Please we can do something else.\" Mickey begs you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"I can't do that for you Mikey, I promised your mother I would give you a bath.\" You notice the sad expression on his face (or Julia's face for that matter). \"But we could just skip washing your hair instead.\" Mickey smiles at the proposal and agrees to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Mikey make your way upstairs and first go to his mother's room. \"We first need to take off those clothes.\" You tell him. \"You know how?\" Mikey shrugs his shoulders. \"Yeah me neither.\" You tell him. You first try to pull the skirt down, but it's stuck. It's then that you notice a few buttons at the side of the skirt and undoing them, allows you to pull them off. You also help Mikey take off his blouse, seeing as he didn't know how to do that as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing the blouse and the skirt on the bed you find yourself looking at Julie's body only wearing her bra and her panties. You just wish you could you study them up closer, but reminding yourself that a young boy is inside that body, you quickly shake that thought off. You help Mikey unhook the bra for him and let himself take off the panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These things are odd.\" Mikey says pointing at one of his breasts. You can't argue with him there, apart from seeing them in porno magazines you've never seen such big breasts in real life before. You always thought they photo shopped those things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mikey let's go take a bath.\" You both go to the bathroom where you let the bath fill up.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as you want to turn around and tell Mikey to get into the bathtub, Mikey pushes you forward without a notice. Normally you would consider keeping your balance and hold yourself, but with the extra weight in the front (your mother's breasts) you can't hold it, and fall straight into the bath tub, overflowing the bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Evan is wet too.\" Mikey screams playfully as you pull yourself out of the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was naughty Mikey.\" You say grinding your teeth as you pull your mother's hair away from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm completely wet now. What am I supposed to do?\" You ask yourself. Your tank top, or your mother's tank top, is completely wet, showing off your bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, you can take a bath with me.\" Mikey says clapping his hands excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile a little at Mikey standing there all excited, his breast jiggling a little with the slight movements. You're sure he did it on purpose so you would have to take a bath with him. That boy is smarter than you thought. Would that be an effect of him staying inside his mother's body, or was he always like this and you never noticed it? Whatever the case Mikey has you now. Seeing as how you were partial wet, you can just take a bath with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, Mikey, but in return I'll have to wash your hair.\" You say with a coy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey's face drops his cheerful face, looking rather sad now. <i>That will teach him though.</i> You think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then proceed to undress yourself. You pull the wet tank top over your head, letting it fly into the corner. You then get out of the flats your mother was wearing and then pull off the denim jeans. Looking down now, you are wearing a black bra and panties. Looking at the mirror you take a look at yourself. Though it's wrong to say, your mother has a nice figure for her age. She has a little fat left from her pregnancy, but you can clearly see the effects of her working out every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then that you try to pull off the bra you're wearing, but you're having a little trouble unhooking the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help.\" Mikey says friendly. You want to tell him you can do it yourself, but before you can do anything else Mikey already has it unhooked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's fast. Thanks Mikey.\" You say as you throw the bra into the corner with your other clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" He says giggling. You wonder though how he did it like that, like he was used to do it. You quickly shake those thoughts off, you have other matters at hand now. You then pull off the panties and throw them into the corner. You quickly turn yourself around from the mirror, you rather not face your mother's breasts and vagina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'm finished. Let's go.\" You tell Mikey. Mikey walks to the bathtub first and after first carefully feeling if the water wasn't too warm, he carefully stepped inside and slide himself down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, the bathtub has shrunken.\" Mikey says as she sticks out his feet at the other side of the tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you just got bigger though, now move over Mikey.\" You tell him as you step inside the bathtub yourself. Touching the water yourself carefully you think it's the right temperature. You then carefully sit down in the tub, trying to move your legs so that they don't get in the way of Mikey. When you're done, your legs are at the left and right of Mikey, and his feet are just straightforward, almost hitting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit it, this feels good.\" You say letting your head rest. You don't know whether it's your mother's body or not, but relaxing like this in the bathtub, makes you forget your situation a little. You close your eyes and just let yourself go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Evan, can I ask you something?\" Mikey suddenly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Mikey?\" You ask him still closing your eyes.</span></div></div>",

There can't be any harm in doing so, with no one around to see them or interrupt them, it wouldn't be such a bad thing to enjoy it while it lasted could it? <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After thinking for a moment you decide.... <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Next your unbutton your shirt and you stare for a moment, marveling your mother's DD breasts as they lay packed tightly inside a small bra. As you reach behind to undo the strap of the bra, you become dry mouthed, and feel your heart begin to race as you feel the strap come loose and the bra falls to the floor and you are left topples, with perfect DD breasts bare on your chest. You can't help but stare in the bathroom mirror at your body, the perfect appearance of a super model.

A woman as then for enjoyment, they love to look at them all day and like other people, more so boys, to look at them and touch them for as long as they want,\" as you squeeze your own boobs sending a sensation of pleasure throughout you body. You open you eyes and look at Mikey, with a look of interest on his mother's face. He thinks what you said is true, and looks at his boobs, but does not know what to do. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, Even's mommy.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Within a few minutes of students looking around at each other with perplexed facial expressions, the environment of the class suddenly burst into pandemonium. Desks were turned over. Some students were using this mix-up to steal looks at their new body parts. Others even went so far as to take off parts of their school uniforms, exposing the bodies they had in full glory. Assumably, the boy inside of the teacher's body wasn't exactly acting as a teacher should, either. You however, take advantage of this confusion and sneak out of the classroom, slinging the girl's purse strap onto your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbandoning the girl's textbooks and backpack in the classroom, you run into the hallway and see even more craziness! Ignoring the slight jiggle you could feel on your chest with every rushed step you take, you try to avoid most of the other students pouring out of the other classrooms in case any of them think you're still the girl in her own body. It seems like you weren't the only one affected-- it seems like this entire school had been swapped with other people as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to open the main hallway doors, the light from outside shining in, when you are grabbed on the shoulders from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alyssa! Oh, I'm so glad you're here. I'm not who you think I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not who you think I am either. Now back off!\" You retort to a middle-aged woman, a teacher that had just bursted from another class. You quickly escape into a throng of students, leaving behind the bewildered girl inside the teacher's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the girl you're inhabiting is named Alyssa, you think to yourself, entering the courtyard of the middle school. Outside, there are even more students and teachers alike running about, trying to piece together their haphazard situations. sheesh! Does everybody and their mother have to be out here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for a couple other 'reunions' you had with Alyssa's friends, you reached the school parking lot without too much difficulty. Scanning the lot for people inside their cars, you spotted an old man inside his SUV. You approach the man and open the door to his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What do you think you're doing with my car?\" You assume the identity of whoever the man was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, dude! I was just at the skatepark, and then all of a sudden... boom! I'm in this geezer.\" The man said anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care. This is my car. Get out.\" You try to look serious, which is something that isn't very convincing in the body of a small, seventh grade girl. Luckily, the skater who claims he's the old man aquiesces to your demand, and he slinks out of the car. You climb into the driver's seat and turn the key, which was already in the ignition, or you wouldn't have bothered to hound the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting the mirror and the seat to fit your petite frame, you notice the disadvantage to being a small girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can barely see above the dash board!\" You exclaim, frustrated. And it doesn't help that you hadn't gotten your driver's license yet, either. \"I guess a driver's permit will have to do...\" And you pull out of the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you have done enough driving with your mom to have a basic idea how to drive in-between the lines. But the problem wasn't your driving ability, because the other drivers on the road were behaving erratically! Apparently, this gigantic swap had not only affected your school, it had also affected your community! The current inhabitors of the drivers' bodies were swerving all over the road, obviously not accustomed to driving. One car in front of you swerved unexpectedly off to the right, slamming into a fire hydrant and causing irreversible damage to their sports car. Another car was actually driving in the <i>opposite</i> lane of traffic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotta get back to my school.\" You mutter nervously, dodging as many errant cars flying by you as possible. You are able to locate a familiar street among your large city, and you follow it to another familiar street, until you can see your school at the corner of the intersection you pass everyday to get into your school. The traffic lights appear a bit superfluous at the moment, as no one seems to care about stopping at red lights, and cars collide head-on or are t-boning other cars like it was a demolition derby. However, luck smiles upon you once again, and you are able to wind your way through the wreckage and safely pull into your school's parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's <i>that</i> for a driver's test?\" You say triumphantly. You turn off the SUV and get out of the car, putting the keys in Alyssa's purse that you carry over your shoulder once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to find your own body... that shouldn't be too hard-- among the pandemonium of students rushing everywhere, it'll be like finding a needle in a haystack!</span></div></div>",

We continued to watch the news for a few more minutes while also talking about what we woke up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour, I started getting hungry and went into the kitchen to see what I could find.

I'm going to get something for you to wear instead of this, you look through Corrine's clothes for something you're comfortable with wearing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" I asked. But when I turned around, she was already gone. Still, I did understand what my mom had said. So I slid the Mary Jane's off, followed by the skirt. I opened my sisters closet to look for a pair of jeans or something that wasn't a skirt. I had to actually look kinda hard for something because Corrine liked to show off her body without upsetting my mom. That meant that she liked wearing leggings, skinny jeans, skirts, and dresses. Fortunately, I found a pair of more relaxed jeans that she would wear on a \"lazy day\". As I slid into them, I happened to catch a glance of myself in the mirror and noticed that these jeans really showed off my new butt. Something I'm sure boys my age would definitely approve of, and something I'd have to get used to for the time being. I was about to look for a shirt when my mom came back into the room with a box in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in the box ma?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrine's old bras. These should fit you perfectly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you kept these, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know your cousins Debbie and Abigail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your aunt said that when Corrine grew out of anything to send it her way when the twins would fit. And sense Corrine grew in her chest a little faster than most girls, she's got a few sized of bras she's already outgrown up in the attic. And the twins aren't quite ready for them yet, so their all your\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" I said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, try this on\" he said as he tossed me a light blue sports bra from when Corrine when through an athletic phase. It was really easy to get on, thank god. I then went on to find a grey tee shirt with our school logo on it to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not bad' I thought to myself as I looked myself over in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I sat down in the living room, Corrine changed the channel on the tv back to the news. Just as, he, did the main anchor said \"news just in from the White House. Scientists all over the world over are baffled by this event, and currently no government is taking credit for the shift in bodies. As of right now, we have no idea when or if a way will be found to return people to their rightful bodies. However, the White House has sent a message to all city government buildings saying that over the next few weeks local governments are to register all residents. People will be allowed to either reclaim their old life, or create a new identity for themselves. However, if it is discovered that you have attempted to take someone else's identity and they want it, you will be charged. It is still unclear what the charge will be\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\" Corrine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any ideas about what your going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll probably just reclaim my life. What about you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" I said. \"On the one hand, I could just be me. But on the other hand I could make up my own life as a 13 year old girl and get really good grades for a couple of year\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to sound like a jerk, but that might be the better option. I mean you haven't had the greatest grades the last couple of years. Plus you always said you wished you'd tried out for sports. This could be your chance\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I mean, your new body is built for sports. Your breasts aren't that big so they won't get in the way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right sweetie\" mom said as she walked in from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that on the phone\" Corrine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Aunt Suzanne\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are they?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your aunt is unshifted, and the twins swapped with each other\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So their all basically unshifted\" I said. \"What about Uncle Tom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He hasn't shown up yet. But it's only been about 4 hours since this all happened. Anything new on the news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe told mom about the report that was on just a few minutes ago. We continued to watch the news for a few more hours, with no new updates, and eventually we all decided to go to bed around 9:00. Mom went in, his, room while Corrine and I went in each other's rooms. Figuring I shouldn't sleep in jeans, I took them off and found a pair of Corrine's gym shorts to sleep in. I also took of the tee shirt sense it was hot out and slept in the sports bra.. </span></div></div>",

Sitting up, I realized I felt strange.  Looking down, I quickly realized why \u2013 I was wearing an elegant purple dress and heels.  <i>What the hell?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to figure out what was going on, I decided to look in the mirror over the nearby sink.  Reaching up, I grabbed the sink and started to pull myself up.  I quickly got to my feet, but I wasn\u2019t used to standing in heels.  Using the sink for support, I stood up and got my first look at my new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever had caused me to blackout had put me inside the body of Elaine Sato; a well-known reporter for the local news.  I tried to convince myself I was imagining things, but that became difficult when I looked down and saw a modest amount of cleavage poking through the dress I was now wearing.  \u201cThis can\u2019t be possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing more screams outside the bathroom, I decided to go see what was going on.  I took my first, unsteady, steps in heels as I walked to the door.  Thankful that I didn\u2019t fall, I opened the door to find the area in chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were people screaming all over the place; outside a nearby window, I saw smoke from several car fires.  As I looked around the room, I quickly realized where I was \u2013 I was at Town Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling an overwhelming urge to help, I made my way outside.  Once I was outside, standing on the steps of Town Hall, I looked around at the chaos before me.  People were running all over the place; many of them calling out for help or searching for loved ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I made my way towards the parking lot, I spotted a station car that I assumed Elaine and her crew had arrived in.  Moving closer, I saw that a camera was set up, but there was no one around.  I made a decision to take the car and go home, but I was stopped by a young pregnant woman who came running up to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, you\u2019ve to help me.\u201d Panicking, the woman said, \u201cMy wife ended up in my body; she\u2019s got a real nasty cut on her leg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sense of self-preservation was quickly overtaken by an urge to help.  \u201cOkay, take me to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly followed the woman around a nearby corner, where I found a man leaning against the wall with a large cut on his leg.  Walking over to him, I said, \u201cCan you hear me, ma\u2019am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Wincing, the woman said, \u201cCan you help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d taken a few First Aid courses over the summer, in the hopes of getting a job as a lifeguard.  Looking at the pregnant woman, I said, \u201cGo find something I can use as a tourniquet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman ran off, I turned my attention to the man.  It wasn\u2019t long before she came back with what looked like a towel.  Before I could do anything, a young boy came running up to us.  \u201cI\u2019m a doctor, I can help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping aside to let the doctor take over, I turned my attention to the pregnant woman.  She was standing nearby, in hysterics.  Walking over to her, I said, \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be alright, ma\u2019am; your wife is going to be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, the woman I was talking to was actually the original occupant of the man\u2019s body.  They were on the way to the hospital for an appointment they blacked out.  I thought I had it bad; ending up in Elaine\u2019s body, I couldn\u2019t imagine what it was like suddenly finding yourself 7 months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the doctor got the man stabilized, he got some bystanders to help take him to the hospital. It was only then that I was finally able to process what happened to me; I\u2019d gone from being a 15-year-old sophomore to a woman in her early 30s.  I don\u2019t know what possessed me to do so, but I suddenly felt the need to report what I was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to the news car, I managed to turn on the camera.  Once I was sure it was working, I hit record and walked in front of the camera.  \u201cHello, this is Elaine Sato; reporting for Channel 7 News.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m here at Town Hall, as citizens all over town have somehow swapped bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t sure why I\u2019d used Elaine\u2019s name instead of my own, but it was too late to fix that now.  As the chaos continued around me, I recounted the events that I\u2019d seen up until now.  As I finished up the report, I said, \u201cI encourage everyone to find a safe place to stay until further notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to the camera, I turned it off and wondered what to do next.  I quickly realized the best thing for me to do was to get the report back to the station as soon as possible.</span></div></div>",

I made a decision to take the car and go home, but I was stopped by a young pregnant woman who came running up to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, you\u2019ve to help me.\u201d Panicking, the woman said, \u201cMy wife ended up in my body; she\u2019s got a real nasty cut on her leg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sense of self-preservation was quickly overtaken by an urge to help. \u201cOkay, take me to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly followed the woman around a nearby corner, where I found a man leaning against the wall with a large cut on his leg. Walking over to him, I said, \u201cCan you hear me, ma\u2019am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Wincing, the man said, \u201cCan you help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d taken a few First Aid courses over the summer, in the hopes of getting a job as a lifeguard. Looking at the pregnant woman, I said, \u201cGo find something I can use as a tourniquet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman ran off, I turned my attention to the man. It wasn\u2019t long before she came back with what looked like a towel. Before I could do anything, a young boy came running up to us. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor, I can help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly stepped aside to let the doctor work.  Looking around, I spotted the pregnant woman standing nearby; crying hysterically.  Walking over to her, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLl-Lloyd...Lloyd Simmons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Lloyd, I\u2019m Elaine.\u201d Looking at Lloyd, I said, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m not alright!\u201d in shock, Lloyd said, \u201cI was taking wife my to her OB appointment when everything went dark; I wake up and find that I\u2019m in her body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be alright, Lloyd.\u201d Trying to calm him down, I said, \u201cThat boy over there is a doctor; he\u2019s going to sure your wife\u2019s injuries aren\u2019t too severe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSh-She can\u2019t die.\u201d Looking at me, Lloyd said, \u201cI-I can\u2019t be a single mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not going to die, Lloyd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few more minutes, but the doctor managed to get Lloyd\u2019s wife stabilized.  Getting her into the back of a nearby car, with Lloyd climbing in with her, he got some bystanders to take them to the hospital.  The doctor ran off before I could thank him for his help; leaving me alone in the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that I was finally able to process what happened to me; I\u2019d gone from being a 15-year-old sophomore to a woman in her early 30s.  As I looked around at the chaos, I realized I needed to do something.</span></div></div>",

Once I was sure it was working, I hit record and walked in front of the camera. \u201cHello, this is Elaine Sato; reporting for Channel 7 News.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m here at Town Hall, as citizens all over town have somehow swapped bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t tell you why I did it, but that was the second time in 5 minutes that I\u2019d used Elaine\u2019s name instead of my own.  As the chaos continued around me, I recounted the events that I\u2019d seen up until now. As I finished up the report, I said, \u201cI encourage everyone to find a safe place to stay until further notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to the camera, I turned it off and wondered what to do next. I quickly realized the best thing for me to do was to get the report back to the station as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 15-minute drive to the station was difficult enough with the burning cars and screaming people; it was made even more so by the fact that I\u2019d never driven before, let alone in heels. When I finally reached the station, I parked the car and made my way to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d no sooner stepped inside when I was greeted by who I thought was Dominic Greene, the morning traffic reporter. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you, Elaine.\u201d Grabbing my arm, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got no reporters, and both my anchors are nowhere to be seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly realized that the person in front of me wasn\u2019t Dominic. Pulling my arm free, I stopped in a hallway and said, \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, but who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right, sorry.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s me, Paul Donahue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew who Paul was from a field trip I\u2019d taken here in 6th grade; he was a producer here. The body he found himself in was an improvement over the last time I\u2019d seen him. Looking at him, I said, \u201cI-I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s you, Paul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it myself, but here we are.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cI guess you got lucky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to tell him the truth; but instead, I said, \u201cI made this report from Town Hall, about the events transpiring around town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best Elaine.\u201d Taking the tape, he said, \u201cFollow me; you can watch it from the Control Room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quietly followed Paul down the hall, wondering if I\u2019d gotten myself in over my head. My feet killing me from the heels, I sat down as Paul told one of the techs to air the report. I watched as the report I\u2019d made at Town Hall was broadcast; somewhat unsettled by the idea that it was me controlling Elaine\u2019s body.</span></div></div>",

The technician answered it and quickly turned to Paul.  \u201cPaul, it\u2019s the station manager; he wants to talk with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Paul took the phone and had what appeared to be an exciting conversation.  It was then that the stress of the situation became too much; I started to feel nauseous.  Running out of the control room, I quickly found the bathroom and ran inside.  I barely made it to the toilet before I threw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting there for a moment, catching my breath, I got up and walked over to the sink.  Looking at my reflection in the mirror, I thought about what happened to me.  In the last hour, I\u2019d gone from being a 15-year-old High School Sophomore to a reporter in her early 30s.  I began to wonder how many others found themselves in similar situations; or if there were those in worse situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started thinking about my family and whether they were safe or not.  In all the chaos out there, I didn\u2019t even know how to begin to find them.  Before I could dwell on that too much, there was a knock at the door.  Walking over to the door, I opened it and found the control room technician standing there.  \u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPaul needs to see you in his office.\u201d Pausing, he said, \u201cSomething\u2019s come up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made my way down the hall to Paul\u2019s office; intent on coming clean about who I really was.  But once again I was interrupted.  <br>\r\nAs soon as I walked into the room, Paul said, \u201cElaine, that was the Station Manager.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cA helicopter is on its way here; to bring you to the Capital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Capital?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Governor is going to hold a news conference in an hour.\u201d Pausing, Paul said, \u201cAll three local stations are sending reporters, and the Manager wants to send you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sitting up, I realized that I felt strange.  Now I\u2019d never worn woman\u2019s clothes before, so you can understand that I was a little shocked to see myself suddenly wearing a skirt and heels.  <i>What the hell is going on here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around at my surroundings, I noticed that I wasn\u2019t in any bathroom I\u2019d ever seen before.

I was understandably shocked by what I saw in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever had caused me to blackout had somehow caused me to swap bodies with Elaine Sato, a local morning news anchor.  Bringing a hand up to my face, I tried to convince myself that I was dreaming, but that became difficult when I saw the reflection copying my every move.  A quick glance downward revealed a pair of breasts showing the top of the dress I found myself wearing.  <i>\u201cThis can\u2019t be possible.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I was interrupted by someone knocking on the door.

Turning towards the camera, as if I\u2019d done this many times before, I said, \u201cHello, this is Elaine Sato reporting for Channel 7 News.\u201d Pausing to look at the teleprompter, I said, \u201cAs you\u2019re all no doubt aware, an unusual event has occurred in the area; causing people to suddenly find themselves in another person\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver my earpiece, I could hear Phil said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing great, Elaine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint smile formed on my lips as I continued speaking.  \u201cWhat you may not be aware of is that this is not a localized event; we\u2019ve received reports that whatever this was has affected the entire planet.\u201d  Taking a breath, I said, \u201cAs a safety precaution, the police are suggesting that you stay where you are.  If you\u2019re outside, please find a safe place indoors.  We\u2019ll give you more information as we receive it.  Once again, this is Elaine Sato reporting for Channel 7 News.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Phil said to go to commercial, he walked over to me and said, \u201cYou did great, Elaine; I knew you could do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes one of us.\u201d Taking the microphone off my dress, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve never been so nervous in all my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a few minutes to calm down.\u201d Looking at me, Phil said, \u201cThat report will broadcast on a loop until we have something new to report.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Standing up, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go outside and catch my breath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful; there might be looters running around.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The streets surrounding the station were littered with crashed and overturned vehicles.  I could hear people screaming all around me.  It was then, for the first time since this started, that I became concerned for my family.  Oh God, I hope they\u2019re alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stood outside the building, I heard someone approaching.  Turning in the direction of the noise, I saw a young woman around 19 years old.  I didn\u2019t know her, but she seemed to know me.  \u201cElaine!  Is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to say no, but something compelled me not to.  Looking at her, as she got closer, I said, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank God!\u201d running up to me, the girl wrapped her arms around me and hugged me.  \u201cThe last thing I remember, I was talking to Phil in his office; when suddenly I black out and find myself on the floor of a Starbucks in this girl\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting two and two together, I looked at the girl and said, \u201cDiane?  Is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane Griffin was the co-anchor of the morning news; she was in her late 30s.  It seemed she\u2019d gotten an upgrade when she switched bodies.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cThank god you\u2019re here; Phil was worried when he couldn\u2019t find you or Keith.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can only imagine; it\u2019s pretty crazy out there.  It\u2019s a miracle I made it back here in one piece.\u201d Digging through her purse, or rather the Starbucks girl\u2019s purse, she said, \u201cHas Keith made it back yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t only hope that he ended up switching with one of those young, 20-something bimbos that always seem to hang around him.\u201d  Looking at me, Diane said, \u201cThat lecher deserves to be taken down a peg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only watch as Diane kept rummaging through the purse; thankful that she seemed too preoccupied to notice my surprise.  I\u2019d never really followed the news very closely, but I remembered I always had Keith and Diane\u2019s morning news show on before she left for work.  Keith and Diane had been known as the town\u2019s sweethearts for years; to hear her talking about him that way was surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t believe what this girl was doing before the swap, Elaine.\u201d Diane continued digging through the purse and until she found what she was looking for.  \u201cAh! Here it is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a moment to figure out exactly what I was looking at, but I soon figured it out.  \u201cA pregnancy test?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d pointing to a small window, she said, \u201cLook what it says.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer, I realized what the marks meant.  \u201cIt\u2019s positive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you believe it?\u201d smiling, clearly excited about the news, Diane said, \u201cI never thought I\u2019d get a chance to have kids after...well, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t know what she was talking about, but I decided to play the part of an understanding friend.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what did yours say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine?\u201d getting confused, I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou told me this morning you were going to take one.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cWhat did it say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to panic on the inside as I realized what Diane was talking about.  \u201cYou know it\u2019s been such a crazy day, I haven\u2019t had a chance to do it yet.\u201d  Looking at her, I said, \u201cI was about to take it when Phil came in and told me he needed me to anchor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas Phil affected by this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he ended up in the body of one of the interns.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cThat petite girl, Grace Swanson, from accounting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOld Phil in Grace\u2019s body; that\u2019s too funny.\u201d Pausing, Diane said, \u201cCome find me after you take the test.  It\u2019d be awesome if we could both be pregnant at the same time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll find you when it\u2019s done.\u201d Trying to control myself, I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go check in with Phil; I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be happy to know you\u2019re alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane and I walked into the station together; while she went off to find Phil, I made a beeline back to the bathroom where this had all started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the bathroom, I looked around for the pregnancy test I hoped that I wouldn\u2019t find.  I felt a lump in my throat when I found it against the wall by the sink.  Kneeling down to grab it, I turned it over to look at the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately felt an overwhelming wave of nausea when I saw what the results were \u2013 <b>Pregnant</b>.  Making my way into the nearest stall, I barely made it over the toilet before I threw up.  As if it wasn\u2019t bad enough that I\u2019d ended up in the body of an older woman, to top it all off, I was now pregnant.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d gone from being a 15-year-old boy to a pregnant 32-year-old woman in a matter of hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting there for a few more minutes, I decided the best thing for me to do was to get up and move.  As I stood up in the stall I realized I was getting better at standing in heels; the thought of which scared me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I\u2019d composed myself, I walked out of the bathroom.  Hearing voices coming from the control room, I decided to head there.  Walking into the room, I saw Diane sitting at one of the consoles in the back.  Spotting me, she got up and ran over.  \u201cSo what did the test say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d hugging me, Diane said, \u201cWe can help each other out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything, Phil walked into the room.  Seeing me, he said, \u201cThere you are, Elaine; we need you to go back on the air.\u201d Handing me some papers, he said, \u201cThe Governor just announced a mandatory curfew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrateful for something to take my mind off the pregnancy test, I took the papers and said, \u201cGreat, I-I\u2019ll be on there in a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d looking at me, Phil said, \u201cYou don\u2019t look too good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh you have no idea.</i>  \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?  I can have Diane take over for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine; I can do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the paperwork in hand, I walked through the door leading to the newsroom.  As I walked behind the desk, I heard Phil said, \u201cWe\u2019re going live in 5\u20264\u20263\u20262\u20261.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Phil said 1, I turned to the camera and said, \u201cThis is Elaine Sato for Channel 7 News.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cThe Governor has just announced a mandatory curfew; set to take effect at 4:30 PM.  Local police ask that if you can\u2019t make it home, that you make your way to the library or police station; where they\u2019ve set up emergency shelters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been 20 minutes since I\u2019d finished the broadcast; I was sitting at what I\u2019d earlier discovered to be Elaine\u2019s desk.  Having found her cell phone, I was frantically trying to get a hold of my mom and sister.  Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t get a call out; figuring the cell towers must be down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI threw the phone on the desk in frustration as Diane walked into the room.  Pulling up a chair, she sat down and said, \u201cSo Phil just said the police want to evacuate the area.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cHe managed to get us some police escorts to take us home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds <i>really</i> good right about now.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \"Especially if it's true about the rioting and the looting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhil\u2019s staying with me; if you want to join us.\u201d Chuckling, Diane said, \u201cWe could have a girl\u2019s night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs much fun as that sounds, I\u2019d think I\u2019d rather go to my place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can understand that.\u201d Getting up, Diane hugged me and said, \u201cPlease stay safe; remember, you\u2019re responsible for two lives now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging Diane, I said, \u201cSame goes for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Diane left, I grabbed my...Elaine\u2019s purse and phone from the desk and walked out of the room.  As I walked down the hall, I thought about how strange my day had been; and how it was likely to get even stranger.</span></div></div>",

The more I saw, the more grateful I was for the police escort.  There were people fighting and looting all over the place; I could only imagine what they would do to me if they got a hold of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was pulled back from my revere by the officer, a young man in his mid-20s.  Looking at me, he said, \u201cYou must consider yourself pretty lucky, ma\u2019am; getting to keep your own body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to say that I had switched bodies, that everyone at the station was too focused on what was happening to realize I wasn\u2019t Elaine.  But I didn\u2019t.  Looking at him, I said, \u201cI guess you could say that.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cHow about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t so lucky.\u201d Swerving to avoid a car fire, the officer said, \u201cI was going to retire next week, after 25 years on the force.  Now I\u2019m suddenly in the body of a rookie who started only 3 months ago.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how that must feel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer and I talked for a few minutes until we arrived outside Lake Crest Condominiums.  I\u2019d gone by the complex a few times, but I never anticipated that I\u2019d end up living here.  Parking the car in front of the building, the officer said, \u201cDo you need an escort, ma\u2019am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Grabbing Elaine\u2019s purse, I said, \u201cThank you for the ride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, he said, \u201cMy pleasure, ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked towards the building\u2019s entrance, I dug through the purse until I found Elaine\u2019s keys.  Using the keycard on the ring, I let myself into the building.  I\u2019d learned from Elaine\u2019s license that she lived in #304; so I decided to go there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to risk getting stuck in an elevator if the power went out, I decided to use the stairs.  By now I was getting pretty good at walking in heels, but I was looking forward to when I could finally take them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon found myself outside Elaine\u2019s place.  After fumbling for the right key, I was able to let myself inside.  After closing the door, I quickly removed the heels and kicked them aside.  Taking my first steps without heels, I let out a sigh of relief.  \u201cWhy do women wear these things?  My feet are killing me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around as I walked further into the condo.  The more I looked, the more I realized that Elaine had expensive tastes; as was made evident but what looked to be an expensive bottle of wine sitting in a wine cooler on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was tempted to pour myself a glass; when I remembered I was pregnant now.  \u201cJust great, my first chance to drink some wine and I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing further into the condo, I found myself in the living room.  Looking for a chance to get off my feet, I sat down on the couch.  I\u2019d no sooner sat down when I started to feel tired; the stress of the day\u2019s events finally catching up to me.  Resting my head on the pillow, I was asleep in moments. </span></div></div>",

As I sat up on the couch, I wondered why I was in a strange apartment and why there was a hair in my eyes.  Getting up to look around, I felt a weight on my chest.  Looking down, I saw a pair of breasts underneath a dress; causing my memories of the day\u2019s events to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out onto an enclosed porch, I looked around and saw chaos everywhere.  There looked to be several large fires nearby; I could also hear screaming and what sounded like gunshots in the distance.  Despite finding myself in the body of an older woman, I was grateful to be in a safe location rather than outside in the chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back into the family room, I decided that it would be a good idea to change into something a little less feminine than the dress I was wearing.  I quickly found the bedroom and made my way to the closet.  Opening the closet, I was disappointed to find it held nothing but dresses and skirts.  <i>Please tell me there\u2019s something else for me to wear.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning my attention to the dresser, I was relieved to find a pair of flannel pajama pants.  After grabbing a t-shirt to wear, I made my way to the adjoining bathroom.  Looking in the mirror, I was keenly aware that I was about to see a woman\u2019s naked body; I just would\u2019ve preferred not being in the body in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I\u2019d taken the dress off, I decided there was no harm in looking at the mirror.  Turning to face the mirror, I was immediately confronted with the naked body of Elaine Sato.  I thought she was attractive the few times I saw her on TV, I just never figured I\u2019d get such an up-close and personal look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI examined my new body for a few minutes; deciding that it was best to stay away from the waist area.  Once I\u2019d had enough, I put the sweat pants and t-shirt on.  With that accomplished, I walked out of the bathroom.  It was only then that I realized I was starving; I hadn\u2019t eaten anything since this all started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the kitchen, I scrounged through the fridge to find something to eat.  After finding an almost empty box of frozen burgers in the freezer, I decided to finish off the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took 20 minutes to cook the burgers, as well as some fries.  Once I was finished, I took the food back into the living room.  Sitting down at the couch, I turned the TV in the vain hope there was something on TV.  Having seen the conditions outside, I wasn\u2019t surprised to find nothing to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning off the TV, I said, \u201cGuess I\u2019ll just sit and eat in silence.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Having never had to sleep with breasts until last night, I couldn\u2019t find a comfortable position to sleep in that didn\u2019t squish them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of bed, I walked over to the window and looked outside.  The fires I\u2019d seen last night were gone, although I could still see some smoke coming from where they\u2019d been.  Feeling the sudden urge to use the bathroom, I made my way to the bathroom.  As I sat down on the toilet, I realized I had no idea how to pee in a woman\u2019s body.  After sitting there for a moment, I simply relaxed and felt myself start to urinate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving accomplished that, I walked out to the kitchen to make some breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was sitting at the counter, eating some eggs when I suddenly started to feel nauseous.  Putting the plate down, I ran to the bathroom.  Let me tell you, seeing eggs come back up is almost enough to make me swear them off for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vomiting finally stopped after about 10 minutes.  I was washing my hands and face when I heard a knock at the door.  As I made my way to the door, I heard a man\u2019s voice said, \u201cElaine, are you in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the door, I looked through the peephole and saw a younger man standing there.  He looked to be in pretty good shape; much better than I\u2019d been before this.  \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Gloria Palmer from down the hall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no way of knowing if the man was telling the truth.  But something compelled me to open the door.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cGloria, what happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe same thing that happened to most everyone else.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI was grocery shopping when suddenly I blacked out; when I came too, I was on the floor of the men\u2019s shower at the gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly realized Gloria had a more traumatic experience then I\u2019d had.  That\u2019s not to say waking up in a woman\u2019s body wasn\u2019t traumatic, but she woke up in a naked man\u2019s body.  \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been running.  Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI and a few others spent the night at the gym.\u201d Pausing, Gloria said, \u201cOnce the sun came up, I realized I was only a few miles away so I decided to make my way back here.  I was hoping you still had a copy of my keys; since mine are with my other body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI honestly had no idea whether Gloria\u2019s keys were here or not.  Stepping aside, I said, \u201cI think they\u2019re here somewhere, why don\u2019t you come in and look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the apartment, she said, \u201cThank you, Elaine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door, I followed Gloria into the kitchen.  \u201cI was just finishing breakfast; I think there are still some eggs left over if you want some.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Gloria looked at me with suspicion.  Walking over to me, she said, \u201cSo, Elaine, do you remember last month when I introduced you to my nephew Robert?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to feel a little nervous; wondering if Gloria had figured out that I wasn\u2019t really Elaine.  \u201cOf course I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not really Elaine, are you.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?  Of course, I\u2019m Elaine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you were really Elaine, you\u2019d know that last month I introduced you to my niece Samantha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine, you\u2019re right.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not Elaine; my name\u2019s Evan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Evan, do you mind explaining why you\u2019re in Elaine\u2019s condo pretending to be her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that I\u2019d been caught, I proceeded to spill the beans.  I told Gloria everything; from waking up in Elaine\u2019s body at the station to reporting on the air in her body.  When I was finished, I said, \u201cHow did you know I wasn\u2019t the real Elaine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mentioned having eggs for breakfast.\u201d Looking at me, Gloria said, \u201cElaine is allergic to eggs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that explains the bout of nausea I had before you showed up.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI just figured it was a side effect of being pregnant.\u201d </span></div></div>",

I found it and saw that it said <b>PREGNANT</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear I was feeling must\u2019ve shown on my face; because Gloria quickly reached over and hugged me.  \u201cOh honey, it\u2019ll be alright.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sure things will be back to normal soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Gloria, fighting back tears, I said, \u201cYou think so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been a woman for barely a day and I was already becoming an emotional wreck.  Taking my hand, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s some scientist out there trying to reverse this.  I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll all be back in our rightful bodies soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do in the meantime?\u201d looking at her, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know the first thing about being a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe hugged for a few more seconds before slowly pulling back.

Seeing that, I yelled out, \u201cGloria!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning into the room, Gloria said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m <i>not</i> wearing that.\u201d Pointing to the dress, I said, \u201cDoesn\u2019t Elaine have something less feminine to choose from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Evan, but I\u2019m afraid she doesn\u2019t.\u201d walking over to me, Gloria said, \u201cElaine was a very feminine woman; I rarely saw her wearing something that wasn\u2019t a dress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cOf all the people to switch with, why did it have to be Elaine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can complain about this later.\u201d Picking up the dress, Gloria handed it to me and said, \u201cRight now, we need to get you ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I took the dress, I looked at Gloria and said, \u201cWhy are you helping me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe barely know each other.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cWhy are you going out of your way to help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Gloria grabbed a framed photo from the dresser and handed it to me.  Looking at it, I realized it was a photo of Elaine and her parents.  Judging from the photo, I figured it was Elaine\u2019s college graduation.  Looking at me, Gloria said, \u201cElaine\u2019s parents died in a fire 4 years ago, barely a month after that photo was taken.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to deal with the loss of one\u2019s parents, especially at that young age.  I helped her through it and we became a sort of surrogate family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re helping me because I\u2019m in Elaine\u2019s body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a way, yes.\u201d Looking at me, Gloria said, \u201cMostly it\u2019s because you\u2019re also dealing with a life-altering change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to tear up a little when I heard that.

I quickly put two and two together and realized who the other girl was.  \u201cThat skirt is very becoming on you, Kieth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery funny, Elaine.\u201d Scoffing, Kieth said, \u201cWe can\u2019t all keep our bodies as you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Think again, buddy.</i>  Sitting next to him, a smile on her face, Diane said, \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t prove karma exists, then I don\u2019t know what will.\u201d Turning to Keith, Diane said, \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better punishment for your sexist attitude then to end up in the body of a Catholic school girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when I realized I\u2019d recognized the logo on Keith\u2019s blouse; it was for St. Ann\u2019s School, a private Catholic school on the outskirts of town.  At the moment Phil finally had enough.  \u201cCan we get down to business here?\u201d turning to me, Phil sighed and said, \u201cAs I was telling these two before you arrived, we\u2019ve gotten some new information about what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of information?\u201d excited, I said, \u201cHave they figured out what caused it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet, but they\u2019re working on it.\u201d Taking a breath, Phil said, \u201cFor now they\u2019re saying this Great Shift has affected approximately 90% of the planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very original name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could respond, a girl no older than 12 ran into the room.  I quickly realized she must\u2019ve been an employee because she was wearing a headset and mouthpiece.  \u201cOur specialist just arrived, Phil.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great, Mark; send him in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mark ran off, I turned to Phil and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe managed to track down a scientist who might be able to explain what happened.\u201d Looking at me, Phil said, \u201cHis name is Dr. Jackson Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then I heard footsteps out in the hall.  Turning around, I looked at the door just as Dr. Webber walked in - inside the body of ____.</span></div></div>",

Taking a breath, I said, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations.\u201d With a smile, Dr. Webber took my hand in hers.  \u201cYou and your boyfriend must...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was confused when Dr. Webber stopped mid-sentence.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cAre you alright, Dr. Webber?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I-I\u2019m fine.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cIt just occurred to me that you probably haven\u2019t heard from your boyfriend since this started.  I\u2019m sorry if it came off as insensitive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been so caught up with ending up in Elaine\u2019s body; I hadn\u2019t stopped to think about the idea that she must\u2019ve had a boyfriend.   Making a note to talk to Gloria, I looked at Dr. Webber said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d With a smile, I said, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from him yet, but I\u2019m sure I will eventually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you hear from him soon.\u201d Looking at a clock on Elaine\u2019s desk, she stood up and said, \u201cI should probably get going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, I said, \u201cDo you have a place to stay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d Nodding, she said, \u201cApparently the former occupant of my body just moved here.  She doesn't have a place yet, but another nurse offered to let me stay with her..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked Dr. Webber to the door, I saw a police officer waiting next to a running car.  Turning to Dr. Webber, I said, \u201cI hope I get to see you again, Dr. Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElaine, please call me Jackson.\u201d Hugging me, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be seeing me again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was taken aback by the hug; if only because it was unexpected.  We\u2019d only known each other for a short time, but I felt a kinship with Dr. Webber.  Maybe it was because we\u2019re now roughly the same age, or perhaps because we were both women now.  <br>\r\nWhatever it was, I considered her a friend.  Reciprocating the hug, I said, \u201cStay safe, Dr. Web...Jackson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too, Elaine.\u201d Getting into the police car, she said, \u201cPlease tell Elaine I\u2019ll return her outfit when I get the chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she won\u2019t mind if you keep it for a while.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cBesides, I think it would be a little big on her new body.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Walking out of the station, I saw Phil getting into the car with Diane and Roger, while the rest of the staff got into other cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking my way down the sidewalk, I saw a woman standing in front of a police cruiser.  Walking up to her, I said, \u201cI take it you\u2019re my ride home today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s right ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride back to the condo was quiet compared to this morning; this officer wasn\u2019t as chatty as Roger.  Once we arrived at the condo complex, I stepped out of the car.  Before going inside, I leaned through the window and said, \u201cThank you for the ride, Officer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, ma\u2019am.\u201d Quick and to the point, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back tomorrow at 7:45 to pick you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the officer drove off, I made my way into the building.  With all the reports of violence and vandalism, I was glad to see that the building was unscathed.  Walking up the stairs, I was about to enter Elaine\u2019s condo when I changed my mind.  Turning around, I walked across the hall and knocked on Gloria\u2019s door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I didn\u2019t hear a response, I tried the handle and was surprised to find it unlocked.  Walking into the condo, I saw that it was very modest compared to Elaine\u2019s.  There were still some expensive looking items, but it seemed that Gloria\u2019s tastes weren\u2019t as expensive as Elaine\u2019s.  Making my way into the living room, I called out, \u201cGloria?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon heard footsteps behind me.  Turning around, I saw Gloria walking out of the bedroom naked.  \u201cEvan!?\u201d grabbing a towel from a nearby chair, Gloria quickly covered herself.  \u201cW-What are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just got back from the station.\u201d Trying to get the image of Gloria\u2019s naked body out of my mind, I said, \u201cW-What are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAfter you left, I came over and fell asleep.\u201d Pausing, Gloria said, \u201cI woke up a little while ago and realized I needed to take a shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you realize your door was unlocked?\u201d looking at her, I said, \u201cI know things have calmed down a bit, but what if someone decided to sneak in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said, I came over and fell asleep.\u201d Shrugging, Gloria said, \u201cI guess I just forgot to lock the door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was sitting on the couch when Gloria walked out of the bedroom 10 minutes later; having just gotten dressed.  She\u2019d mentioned that her nephew had left some clothes behind.  Walking over to the couch, Gloria sat down next to me.  \u201cSo how was your second day at the station?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI proceeded to explain everything that happened today; from Keith in the Catholic girl\u2019s body to my chat with Dr. Webber after the interview.  When I was finished, I said, \u201cConsidering everything that\u2019s happened, I guess today was pretty normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas anyone figured out that you\u2019re not the real Elaine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI think they\u2019re still too focused on what\u2019s happened to realize I\u2019m not her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, Gloria said, \u201cWould you like something to eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could go for some lunch.\u201d Nodding, I said, \u201cAll I\u2019ve had today is a granola bar, and I am eating for two now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gloria walked into the kitchen, she said, \u201cSo are you going to ask me the question, or what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat question?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me from the kitchen, Gloria said, \u201cThe question you\u2019ve been dying to ask me since you came home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly realized what Gloria was referring to, although I hadn\u2019t yet figured out how she knew.  Getting up, I walked over to the counter and sat down on one of the chairs.  \u201cDr. Webber...I mean Jackson, asked if I\u2019d heard from Elaine\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI guess what I want to know is...is there a boyfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere <i>was</i> a boyfriend.\u201d Grabbing a loaf of bread, Gloria said, \u201cBut they broke up over a month ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat caused them to break up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElaine never told me exactly what happened, all I know is there was a fight and they broke up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if the boyfriend isn\u2019t the father, then who is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter the breakup, Elaine was pretty upset.  She went to a broadcasting convention and had a one-night stand with one of the attendees.\u201d  Walking over with a sandwich for each of us, Gloria said, \u201cFrom the sound of things, I think he is the father of your...I mean Elaine\u2019s baby.\u201d</span></div></div>",

When I\u2019d asked why she\u2019d been at the grocery store instead of work, she explained that she was out sick with pneumonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe hung out until around 5:45 when I decided it was time for me to leave.  As I made my way towards the door, I stopped and looked back at Gloria.  \u201cHow you noticed anything odd since the Shift?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean besides ending up in a man\u2019s body?\u201d looking at me, Gloria said, \u201cNot really, why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere were a few times today where I did something without realizing it.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not anything major; I would just cross my legs when I sat down, or I\u2019d move a strand of hair from my face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s nothing to be concerned about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cI guess I was just worried that I was starting to act like a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it worries you, Evan; then why not talk to the doctor you interviewed today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d Nodding, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her tomorrow about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, Evan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye to Gloria, I walked across the hall and let myself into Elaine\u2019s condo.

I started to panic a little until I managed to calm myself.  \u201cGloria\u2019s right, I should just talk to Jackson about this.\u201d Taking a deep breath, I said, \u201cMaybe this will all pass in time.\u201d</span></div></div>",

This is Elaine Sato with the latest on the Great Shift. Authorities with the U.S. government have confirmed that the switch of bodies is permanent. Whether you are in your own body or someone else's, there is no going back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With us now is Dr. Jackson Webber, to discuss this announcement. Thank you for joining us again, Doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Elaine, although I may be changing my name, in light of this. As you said, the circumstances that resulted in the Great Shift cannot be reversed. However, there are other developments which the official statement has not touched upon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you explain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those of us who have switched have noticed that certain traits of our new bodies' previous owners bleeding through into our own personalities. Usually, this means that, for example, a man in a woman's body becomes more feminine, or a woman in a man's body becomes more masculine. However, sometimes, there are other changes in personality. For instance, a person who has never smoked before may find themselves in the body of a chain smoker, and now they crave nicotine. The important thing to remember is, all of us are going through the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Doctor. For Channel 8 News, I'm Elaine Sato.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, I began to gather my things, when I felt a hand on my shoulder. \"May we speak privately, Elaine?\" Dr. Webber asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose. Come this way.\" I led her through the bullpen and into the conference room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the conference room, I asked, \"What's on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should ask that question of you, Elaine,\" she said. \"The government report has you awfully upset. Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"I suppose I might as well tell you. I'm not really Elaine Sato.\"</span></div></div>",

And Melanie George will be stepping down as anchor, due to the fact that she is now a 5-year-old boy. As staggering as this information is, it could have worked out much worse for them. Our guest, Dr. Jackson Webber, will explain. Good morning, Dr. Webber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Elaine. We have received cases of teens and adults with the minds of infants. This leads us to the staggering conclusion that there must be teens and adults who are now trapped in the bodies of infants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is their reaction to this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can only speculate, as an infant's body simply doesn't know how to communicate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the long-term prognosis for cases such as these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with the mature bodies, we have begun getting them back on their feet, and we expect to start teaching them to speak and read and write soon after that. As for the mature minds in infant bodies, there is no telling. It may be that, over time, their minds will regress into infancy. We may know more in the years ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for joining us, Doctor. For Channel 8 News, I'm Elaine Sato.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the interview over, I brought Dr. Webber into the ladies' room. \"Thank you for not telling anyone about me, Doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've kept quiet for two reasons, Evan. The first is, I've had a chance to observe your co-workers. If I did tell them, I'm not certain they would believe me, even with rock solid evidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their identities are wound up in you. Any challenge to you would be a challenge to them, as well. This is because of the second reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever your intentions for starting down this road, you've inspired millions of people, to make it through another day, if nothing else. That banner outside may have Elaine's name on it, but the message is for you.\" She paused. \"I'm nowhere near ready to forgive you for your deceiving me, but I won't be making any trouble for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe I'm thinking enough like a woman that it doesn't bother me anymore. Maybe it's the baby. Maybe it's the sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday afternoon, and then again last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing. I'm nowhere near ready to go that far. Enjoy your weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging into my purse, I found a set of car keys. The ignition key was the kind where I could remotely. Getting an idea, I walked into the station garage, I held the key up and clicked the unlock button. I was rewarded with a distant beep and a flash I caught out of the corner of my eye. Walking toward the flash, pressing the button occasionally to make sure I was headed in the right direction, I came to a cool convertible. <i>I could get used to driving this,</i> I thought. Then I saw that it was a two-seater. <i>Better not get</i> too <i>used to it. Right, baby?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere still weren't too many cars on the road, but I kept an eye on the speedometer anyway. So it was something of a shock when a police car came up behind me, turned on the flashers, and gave a whoop with the siren. I pulled over and started looking for my registration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's your day going, Ms. Sato?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did a double take. It was Officer Perkins. \"I thought it was going well. I could swear I was going the speed limit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled. \"Sorry, I couldn't resist asking my sergeant to help me with this. You aren't in any trouble. I just wanted you to meet someone.\" She motioned to someone in the cruiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman Officer Perkins's age came to my car. \"How do you do, Ms. Sato? I'm Rachel Richter. I understand you know my, ah, new bride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"She is the father of my baby. I want you to know, I don't want to come between you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we could visit occasionally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that. Two very special aunties. Except it's just occurred to me that I don't know your wife's name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to be Brian. Her name was Kayla. I'll answer to either one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" I wrote out my address. \"Don't be strangers.\"</span></div></div>",

My neighbor, Glenn, and I were talking, about how upset I was. Then, all of a sudden, I kissed him. Then, he kissed me, and we made a trail of discarded clothes to the bedroom. Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been... feeling some things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. And you want to know if it's okay to act on those feelings? Well, I won't ask for personal details. If there are no personal or professional barriers to it, I say, go for it.

A week after, we were all encouraged to return to work or school. Let me start with my Channel 8 family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil changed her name to Felicia, and embraced her new life as a single mother. She loved Luke, and would do anything for him. I also noticed that whether she covered up when she was breastfeeding depended on if there was a man in the room. Whenever she was asked if she was ready to start dating again, she just said, \"Luke demands all my attention and fills my home with odors, who needs a man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane was seeing Roger, though people disagreed on how long that was going to last. They argued a lot, mostly because Diane didn't like Roger patrolling the streets as a cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was now Kanika, and was settling into her new life admirably. And, if you couldn't tell she was giving her cameraman definite signals, I don't know what to tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie, now known as Mitch, was a study in contrasts. A week of kindergarten was enough to convince everyone involved that he was too smart for it, and his interviews were journalistic masterpieces. And then, once the cameras were off, he liked to sit in his office playing, and any trip to McDonald's meant that he <i>had</i> to spend some time in the ball pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard had become Rhea. She called us a lot from the home she shared with Chad and his husband, Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian decided to be Brianna, and settled in with Rachel. It really changed her life. She told me she had no idea what she was missing out on as a bachelor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline was looking for a new place, and now wanted to strike a better balance between her work and her social life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brings us to me, and how much my life has changed. Boy howdy, has it ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally got to see a doctor, and was surprised to find out that I was 6-8 weeks along. My doctor said that this was common with women, so I didn't blow my secret right then and there. I also started seeing an obstetrician, one who had been shifted into the body of a girl who still needed a training bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy breasts went up a cup size, and it won't be long before my clothes start getting snug around the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the biggest change was between me and Glenn. After two weeks of telling ourselves that we were just friends with benefits, he finally said the L-word to me, and I said it right back to him. Bonus points: he has a four-door, so we don't need to get rid of the convertible.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, except for our work and Glenn's time at the gym, we were together all the time anyway. Comparing our stuff told us who should do the moving. My furniture and electronics were more high-end, so Glenn had no trouble selling his. That left only his clothes and DVD library, which you'd think would be pretty lightweight, and you'd be right. Still, Glenn insisted I sit out the move, leaving me with nothing to do but sit on the couch and listen to Glenn's friends come up with new ways to say <i>bro</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was never so glad to hear the phone ring, so much so that even seeing it was Diane on the other end couldn't ramp up my enthusiasm. \"What up, girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing nothing, Elaine. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be doing more to help Glenn move in, but he's relegated me to the couch for the duration. What're you calling about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple things I wanted to tell you. First: Bill's sleeping with his wife again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" That poor body had been hit by each and every one of the aftershocks of the Great Shift. I think Kayla Perkins was in there at one point, although I could be misremembering. \"Last I heard, there was an 11-year-old in there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It caught him by surprise, too. He was setting up his usual spot on the couch, when she asked him to come to bed. Apparently, she asked him how to do some things, but she was a willing participant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I couldn't say much about the arrangement. After all, I was a 15-year-old boy in the body of a 32-year-old woman, who made love to a 45-year-old woman in the body of a 25-year-old man. \"Okay. What's the other bit of news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The network is coming to talk to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell them I'm not moving until this kid is at least out of diapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you and me, the whole Channel 8 family. Apparently, we're one of a handful of markets with a mostly female news team. Plenty of newsrooms were turned into sausage fests by the Shift, but only a couple went Taco Tuesday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Thanks for the heads-up, Diane. Talk to you again soon.\"</span></div></div>",

Long story short, my husband left me for his secretary, and, last I heard, she had no trouble having children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why you wouldn't let me help you with moving.

Finally, just as an experiment, I bought a makeup kit, then I tried it out. The second I saw my made-up face, I said to myself, 'There she is.' That's when I realized that I was trans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went to supper in my makeup, and my new mom told me to wash the garbage off. I refused, and told her what I had just realized about myself.

I'm sorry. I mean, congratulations. I mean,... \" He looked to me to offer some means of escape from the predicament his mouth had led him into, but I enjoyed watching him squirm too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, he was freed by the reporter they'd sent. \"Hi. Elaine Sato, right? Jason Costello. Where would you like us to set up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My office will be fine.\" I led the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his crew set up their cameras, I asked Jason, \"Nervous?

Those sinkers did not sit well with me. How do you screw up pancakes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spare me the details, please?\" I patted my belly. \"I've got a tender tummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cameras rolled, Jason interviewed me about my coverage of the Great Shift and its aftermath, then moved on to the station. \"I don't know why we're mostly female, or even if there is a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your producer went from man to woman as a result of the Shift. How has that affected things here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically, it was motherhood that had the greatest effect. You see, Phil's new body had had a baby, which she kept secret from everyone here. Since finding out about her son, Felicia decided to make the station a little more family-friendly. With two of us expecting, and another on maternity leave, that's a huge plus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But one of your colleagues was certainly not family-friendly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keith. She no longer works here, we weren't especially sad to see her go, and I don't care to discuss her further, out of respect for the privacy of all concerned.\"</span></div></div>",

I even reminded her that, if she wants a measuring contest, she's going to come up short.\" She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to change the subject. \"How did you and Kayla meet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the academy. We were in the same class. We knew the job wouldn't let us work together once it got serious, so I quit the force and became an EMT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diane, at the station, is dating a cop. Their relationship has its ups and downs. Any advice you'd care to pass along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just this: Know what you're getting into. You can't ask a cop to hang it up, and expect nothing to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlenn and Bri came in. It was clear things were getting uncomfortable between them. \"Elaine,\" Bri said, \"your guy is having a tough time dealing with the fact that I'm the babies' father, not him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't drag me into this, girlfriend. I'm sleeping with Glenn, not with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf nothing else, that served to put a smile on Glenn's face.</span></div></div>",

As we got ready, Glenn reminded me, \"We won't need to trade the convertible in right now, just when it's time for the kids to go to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the restaurant, the valet parked the convertible, and the maitre d' led us to our table. As I looked at the menu, I noticed someone. \"Four o'clock,\" I said to Glenn. \"Act natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked. \"Bill? And his wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"That's an 11-year-old boy in her body.

Since I have the opportunity, I think I'll just make sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we gave the waiter our orders, I got my chance. She got up and headed for the ladies' room.

I spent two weeks crying over finding myself with half my lifespan gone. Then, I came to three realizations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe counted them on her fingers. \"One: All my crying hadn't made me an hour younger, so I had better give it up. Two: I had fallen in love with Bill. Three: I was sexually attracted to him, too.\" She took a breath. \"I wasn't sure, at first, how to do what I wanted, but Bill is a good man. He helped me. Does that satisfy you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"It does. I meant no insult, Marcia. I didn't know the circumstances, and, if it wasn't as respectful or respectable, I wanted to hear it from you. I'm glad to know I was wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can sympathize with you, Elaine. After all, I knew almost nothing about sex before this.\"</span></div></div>",

Running to the toilet, I bent over just in time to throw up.  I spent the next 5 minutes doing that; wondering where everything was coming from since I hadn\u2019t eaten much since yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the running faucet, I could hear a knock at the door.  Grabbing a bathrobe off the bathroom door, I put it on and made my way to the door.  Looking through the peephole, I saw Gloria standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I opened the door, Gloria looked at me and said, \u201cGood morning, Evan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling a little nauseous, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going so good for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like Gloria was about to ask what I meant until she stopped.  Taking a look at me, she said, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot particularly.\u201d Stepping aside, I said, \u201cI now know why women complain so much about morning sickness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still look a little green.\u201d Walking inside, Gloria said, \u201cDo you want some ginger ale or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door, I said, \u201cThat sounds great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made my way back to the bedroom while Gloria went into the kitchen.  She came into the room a moment later with a small glass of ginger ale.  Handing it to me, she said, \u201cThis should make you feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a sip, I said, \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting a few minutes to let my stomach settle, Gloria and I went about getting me ready for another day at work.  As I walked out of the bathroom wearing another dress that left little to the imagination, I looked at Gloria and said, \u201cI really appreciate your help the last few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to help.\u201d Handing me a pair of heels, Gloria said, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m hoping that you can start taking care of this on your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t come to that.\u201d Sitting in front of the vanity, I said, \u201cI hope to be back in my own body before I have to learn how to do my hair and makeup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying.\u201d Grabbing some eyeliner, Gloria said, \u201cI\u2019d like to get my own body back too, but we both have to understand that might not happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took 20 minutes for Gloria to get me ready.  I had just finished putting on another pair of pantyhose, having put a run in the last pair, when I heard a knock at the door.  Walking to the door, I opened it and saw the officer from last night standing there.  \u201cGood morning, Officer Perkins.\u201d Looking at her nametag, I said, \u201cHow are you this morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m doing well, ma\u2019am.\u201d Smiling, she said, \u201cHow about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll things considered, I\u2019m doing pretty well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked down the hall to the stairs, I found myself looking at Officer Perkins.  She looked to be only a few years younger than I currently was; looking very professional in her appearance.  Walking down the stairs, she looked at me and said, \u201cI finally remembered where I know you from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean other than on TV?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was a crime reporter for a station in Oklahoma before the Shift.  Then I found myself in this body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out into the lobby, I said, \u201cWere you a man or woman before this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was a man.\u201d Gesturing to her hair, and light makeup, she said, \u201cThankfully this woman\u2019s girlfriend is helping me with my hair and makeup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good news.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cAnyway, you said you finally remembered where you knew me from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right.\u201d Chuckling, Officer Perkins said, \u201cWe met at the broadcasting convention in Vegas last month.  There was a little drinking involved, and the two of us spent the night together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take me long to realize what Officer Perkins meant.  The woman standing next to me was the father of Elaine\u2019s unborn baby.  Looking at her, in shock, I said, \u201cThat was you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I recognized you last night, but I wasn't sure where I knew you from.\u201d Opening the front passenger door, she said, \u201cSo how have you been?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to admit I felt terrible about what was about to happen.  I was about to change this woman\u2019s world; possibly even more than it already was.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cI'm pregnant.\u201d</span></div></div>",

But all that went out the window when I ended up in Elaine\u2019s body.  \u201cI suppose shouldn\u2019t be surprised by that.\u201d Walking in behind me, Jackson said, \u201cAfter all, I\u2019m a 55-year-old man in the body of a 27-year-old woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we headed down the hall to Elaine\u2019s desk, I looked at Jackson and said, \u201cHow about you?  Did anything interesting happen to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, actually it did.\u201d Looking at me, Jackson said, \u201cI heard from the original occupant of my body.  It turns out that she didn\u2019t end up in my body after all; instead, she ended up in high school cheerleader in Arizona.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surprised to hear that, as I\u2019d expected that those who\u2019d swapped would end up in the other person\u2019s body.  Turning to Jackson, I was about to say something when we were approached by a teenage girl wearing a headset.  Looking at me, she said, <br>\r\n\u201cElaine, Phil wants to see all the anchors in the conference room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Turning to Jackson, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll catch up to you later, Jackson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo rush, I\u2019m probably just going to be hanging out in the break room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waving goodbye to Jackson, I walked down the hall to the conference room.  Going inside, I found Diane sitting with a few people I didn\u2019t recognize.  There was a young boy in overalls sitting in the corner and an African-American woman, who was probably a few years older than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I took a seat next to Diane, I looked at her and said, \u201cI don\u2019t see Keith.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt we\u2019ll be seeing Keith anytime soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d fearing the worst, I said, \u201cDid something happen to him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems that the parents of his new body tracked him down.\u201d  Looking at me, Diane said, \u201cThey said he may have been Keith Houseman before, but now she\u2019s Mary-Katherine Loftus.  Since none of her nine siblings are on TV, they didn\u2019t think it was appropriate for her to be.  They\u2019re sending her back to St. Anne\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Keith attending Catholic school as a girl made me smile.  \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said she didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeith...err Mary-Katherine isn\u2019t the only one missing.\u201d Looking at me, Diane said, \u201cRichard went into labor last night; after 5 hours of labor he gave birth to a baby boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything, Phil walked into the room.  Closing the door, Phil said, \u201cGlad to see most of us are here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why you had us all come in, Phil.\u201d  Looking at him, the 5-year-old boy said, \u201cThere are only four of us left who are in any condition to go on the air.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to make do with what we have, Melanie.\u201d With a sigh, Phil looked at everyone present and said, \u201cFor now, we\u2019ll be relying on Diane and Elaine to report the news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just going to use Diane and Elaine, then what are Kevin and I doing here?\u201d Gesturing to the African-American woman, Melanie said, \u201cWe\u2019re all anchors here, so use us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor now I think it\u2019s best if Diane and Elaine are the faces people see when they turn on the TV.\u201d  Pausing, Phil said, \u201cElaine wasn\u2019t affected by the Shift, and Diane\u2019s new body isn\u2019t all that different from her old one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept that it\u2019s 25 years younger.\u201d Joining in the conversation, Kevin said, \u201cCome on Phil, just tell us why you don\u2019t want to use us on air.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to, Kevin, until you both interrupted me.\u201d Sighing, Phil said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to use you as anchors for the time being; because I\u2019m going to have you both working as correspondents in the field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that could work.\u201d Pausing, letting the news sink in, Melanie said, \u201cYou want us to talk with those affected; see how they\u2019re coming to terms?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right; I figure it would be a good way for people to help each other.\u201d Smiling, Phil said, \u201cWho knows, I might even go out in the field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell Kevin was in agreement; but before he could say anything, a technician ran into the room.  \u201cPhil, some sort of emergency broadcast just popped up on the TV.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil quickly turned on the TV, flipping through the channels until she saw the image of an empty podium.  Turning to everyone in the room, she said, \u201cI wonder what this is all about.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everyone in the room waited patiently for someone to appear on the screen.  While we waited, Diane looked at me and said, \u201cI hope they\u2019re announcing that they can reverse this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised to hear <i>you</i> say that; especially after how excited you were when you found out you were pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was before I had a chance to process what was going on.\u201d Taking a breath, Diane said, \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m overjoyed by the idea of having a baby.  If this does turn out to be permanent, I\u2019ll be the best mother I can be.  It\u2019s just that part of me wants my old body back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I know how you feel; I want my old life back too.</i>  Before I could say anything a young girl, probably no more than 10 years old, walked onstage and went behind the podium.  Some text appeared on the screen that identified her as Major Derek Hunt.  \u201cLadies and Gentlemen, my name is Major Derek Hunt; I\u2019m the Deputy Press Secretary for the Department of Defense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly looking away from the conference room TV, I looked outside and saw the broadcast on every screen in the Station.  <br>\r\nLeaning over to Diane, I said, \u201cThis must be on every station in the country.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver the last few days, scientists from around the world have been trying to find out everything they can about the phenomenon that caused 90% of the world\u2019s population to swap bodies.  While they\u2019re no closer to discovering a cause for this, they have made an unsettling discovery.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Major Hunt said, \u201cThey\u2019ve discovered that there is no way to reverse the swaps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Major was suddenly overwhelmed by the reactions of people in the audience.  There were several audible gasps in the conference room as well; along with a few screams from outside the room.  I was on the verge of panicking when Diane took my hand in hers.  Turning to her, I quickly realized it wasn\u2019t for my benefit; Diane had gone pale.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this, Diane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good friend, Elaine.\u201d Looking at me, seeing the frightened expression on my face, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re concerned for everyone else; even though you\u2019re still in your original body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The hell I am!  I\u2019m supposed to be a 15-year-old boy, not stuck as a 30-year-old pregnant woman!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the noise died down, Major Hunt continued.  \u201cWhile I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the news many of wanted to hear, myself included, this is now our new reality.  In the coming weeks, the Federal Government will take a census of those who were affected, those who weren\u2019t and those...who are missing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the broadcast ended and the image was replaced by static.  Everyone in the room turned their attention to Phil; who was trying her best to keep herself together.  Turning to me, she said, \u201cElaine, we\u2019re going to need Dr. Webber and you on the air as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can that, Phil...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need your strength, Elaine.\u201d Walking over to me, she said, \u201cYou pulled this city out of panicked rioting, now we need you to prevent more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Pulling myself together, I said, \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to leave after I\u2019m finished; this morning sickness is getting the best of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Pausing, Phil said, \u201cWe'll run it on repeat all day.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As I walked through the halls, in a daze, I spotted Jackson sitting at a table in the break room.  I don\u2019t know why, but my concern for her overrode the concern for myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the room, I went to the table and sat down.  Looking at her, I could tell she\u2019d been crying.  \u201cAre you alright, Jackson?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really.\u201d Wiping her eyes with a napkin, she looked at me and said, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the news I was expecting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I know how you feel.</i>  \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll come to terms with this; if you just give it time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhil wants us both on the air in a few minutes.\u201d Taking her hand, I said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not up to it, I\u2019ll understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I can do it.\u201d Taking a breath, Jackson said, \u201cI suppose going on the air will help me to process this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter our little pep talk, Jackson and I made our way to the set.  We sat down just as Phil was getting the cameras ready.  Once he counted us down, as had become routine over the last few days, I turned to the camera and started talking.  \u201cGood morning, this is Elaine Sato with the latest on the Great Shift.  Just moments ago the US government announced a development in their investigation \u2013 the Great Shift is permanent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused for a few seconds to let that sink in; even though I wasn\u2019t certain there were many people watching.  \u201cWith us in the studio is Dr. Jackson Webber; who will help us to understand the Government\u2019s announcement.\u201d Turning to Jackson, I said, \u201cThank you for joining us again, Doctor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Elaine; although I suspect that I\u2019ll be changing my name in the near future.\u201d  Pausing, she said, \u201cAs you said, the circumstances that resulted in the Shift cannot be duplicated; which means that for the countless victims around the world, myself included, there\u2019s no going back to our original bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything that wasn\u2019t in the broadcast that you feel is worth mentioning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, there is.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cThose of us who have switched have begun to notice certain traits for our new bodies\u2019 original owners bleeding through into our own personalities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to that, I started to realize that might explain why I was becoming less uncomfortable dressing in such a feminine manner.  \u201cCan you explain that a little more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn example of this would be if a man finds himself in a woman\u2019s body, he\u2019ll find himself becoming more feminine; likewise a woman in a man\u2019s body will become more masculine.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cI would even go so far as to suggest one\u2019s sexual orientation might change as a result of being in someone else\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That would certainly explain my last night.</i>  \u201cThank you, Doctor.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cFor Channel 7 News, I\u2019m Elaine Sato.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the cameras had stopped rolling, I removed the microphone and quickly left the studio.  After retrieving my things from what was now my desk, I turned to leave when I felt a hand on my shoulder.  Turning around, I saw Jackson standing there.  \u201cWhat can I do for you, Jackson?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was hoping we could speak privately, Elaine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just about to go home, but I suppose that can wait.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cFollow me; we can talk in the conference room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us walked through the bullpen and into the conference room.  As I closed the door, Jackson said, \u201cI just wanted to make sure you\u2019re doing alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d With a smile, I said, \u201cI\u2019m just not feeling well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d concerned, Jackson said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been acting strangely since that announcement.  Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know what possessed me to do so, but suddenly I found myself wanting to come clean to Jackson.  \u201cI suppose I might as well tell you.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not really Elaine Sato.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve also noticed I\u2019m much more comfortable in women\u2019s clothing than I was when this started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you...Evan.\u201d standing up, Jackson looked at me and said, \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to me for forgiveness and understanding, you won\u2019t find it.  You lied to me and to <i>everyone</i> in that newsroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Jackson, I tho...I thought we were friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so too; until you told me this.\u201d Grabbing her things, Jackson headed towards the door.  Before reaching it, she turned to look at me and said, \u201cI have half a mind to go out there and expose you to everyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from the chair, I rushed out the door to stop her.  Thankfully she didn\u2019t make it very far; as everyone was watching two police officers walk into the bullpen holding a baby.  \u201cIs one of you here in the body of Grace McKinnon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be me, officers.\u201d Stepping forward, Phil said, \u201cWhat seems to be the problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other officer walked over and placed the baby in Phil\u2019s arms.  \u201cThis little guy is yours now.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cHis name is Luke.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Walking by the mailboxes, I don\u2019t know what possessed me to do so; but I decided to check the mail.  It was mostly garbage, but there was an invitation to Elaine\u2019s 10 Year Reunion.  In light of the news, I realized it was now my 10 Year Reunion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading upstairs, I was about to enter my condo when I heard Gloria\u2019s voice behind me.  \u201cIs that you, Evan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to Gloria\u2019s closed door, I said, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard footsteps approaching from behind the door.  It wasn\u2019t long before Gloria opened the door and looked at me.  \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had the best day, Gloria.\u201d Walking into the condo, I said, \u201cIt seems like everything has gone wrong for me today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard the announcement about the Shift.\u201d Closing the door, Gloria said, \u201cHow are you taking it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you think?\u201d tearing up, I said, \u201cI\u2019m stuck in the body of a pregnant woman who\u2019s twice my age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking me to his couch, Gloria said, \u201cNeed I remind you, I\u2019m also stuck in an unfamiliar body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but it\u2019s not really the same.\u201d Sighing, I looked at Gloria and said, \u201cYeah I know you\u2019re in a man\u2019s body now, but you\u2019re also 20 years younger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnder the circumstances, I think it\u2019s alright if we\u2019re both a little testy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that, Gloria.\u201d Wiping tears from my eyes, I said, \u201cI told Jackson who I really was, and she didn\u2019t take it very well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d concerned, Gloria said, \u201cHow exactly did she take it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said I stole an innocent woman\u2019s life for my own benefit.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cThat I\u2019ve been lying to everyone the last few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she\u2019s not exactly wrong.\u201d Seeing the look on my face, Gloria said, \u201cAfter you left yesterday morning, I was angered by the idea that you were masquerading as a woman I\u2019ve known for 5 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat made you come around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI reminded myself of the situation you were in; finding yourself in the body of an older woman.\u201d Standing up, Gloria walked towards the porch door.  \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone, or anything, could have prepared us for this...Great Shift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Gloria balled his trembling hands into fists and slammed them against the glass.  As I sat there watching Gloria, I started to worry that I was losing the one constant that I\u2019d found since the world went crazy.  \u201cGloria, I-I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry? Why would you be sorry?\u201d turning to look at me, Gloria said, \u201cI\u2019m the one who should be apologizing to you; I was so close to ratting you out yesterday.  I was worried that you would ruin my friend\u2019s life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, I walked towards Gloria but didn\u2019t go all the way.  I felt as though the world around me was collapsing.  Looking at Gloria, I said, \u201cWhat changed your mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got to know you, and see you in action.\u201d Looking at me, Gloria said, \u201cI came to realize the huge risk you were taking, not just for yourself but for our whole town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt as though my heart was beating a mile a minute; caught between the fear of losing him and something else.  \u201cGloria, I-I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter Elaine\u2019s parents died, I looked at her like a daughter.\u201d Looking at me, Gloria said, \u201cBut you've become so much more than that.  I\u2019m sorry for...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Gloria could finish his sentence, I closed the gap between us and kissed him.  I could tell he was surprised, but he quickly returned the kiss with a passion that I hadn\u2019t expected.  He cradled my face in his hands and pulled me in.  It wasn\u2019t long before his hands were roaming the curves of my new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word to each other, we started towards the bedroom; kissing and taking off our clothes as we went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were both naked by the time we reached the bedroom; lying on the bed, we soon went a lot further than kissing.</span></div></div>",

My eyes rolled back into my head, I made some incoherent noises and I experienced several amazing orgasms \u2013 just from the one session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must\u2019ve fallen asleep afterward because I woke up to Gloria running his hand along my waist.

After dropping the clothes in a hamper, I made my way into the bathroom.  Having just experienced the plethora of sensations associated with sex, I wasn\u2019t nervous about taking a bath in my new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter letting the tub fill up, I disrobed and climbed in.  I laid in the tub, soaking in the scented bubble bath, thinking about everything that happened over the last few days.  As I lay there, I found myself replaying Jackson\u2019s lecture in my head.

While I waited for the email app to open, I focused on a framed photo on the desk.  Looking at it, I saw it was a picture of Elaine and two other girls on a beach.<br>\r\nLooking at the photo, I couldn\u2019t help but think - <i>There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able to wear that bikini next summer.  I'd look ridiculous in anything except a freaking tent.</i>  I quickly realized what was happening; my mind was starting to change rapidly.  I started to wonder if there\u2019d be anything left of the old Evan when it was finished, or if I\u2019d even remember that I was once a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the email app finally opened, I was created by 8 unread emails; most of which were spam.  After deleting the spam, I was left with an email from Phil about a staff meeting tomorrow and another from Richard Thorpe \u2013 who I remembered had gone into labor last night.  Opening the email I saw a photo of a blonde-haired girl, no older than I\u2019d been before the Shift, holding a baby.

Today was a new day and I was going to start it on the right foot.  After taking a shower, I made some breakfast but quickly realized how futile it was \u2013 as it soon came right back up. <br>\r\nStanding in front of the bathroom mirror, having just finished brushing teeth, I thought to myself - <i>That\u2019s par for the course when you\u2019re having a baby.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I spit into the sink, I realized that was the first time I\u2019d thought of the pregnancy in that way.

Once I got into the car, it was a quick 15-minute drive to the Station.  When we arrived there, Brian said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to pick you up after work.\u201d <br>\r\nLooking at me, she said, \u201cThe Chief wants to talk with those of us who switched into police officers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Getting out of the car, I said, \u201cMy car should still be here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you get pulled over on the way home, just show the officer your ID.\u201d Leaning towards the window, Brian said, \u201cWe have a list of essential personal who are allowed on the streets right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, thanks for the tip.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Brian drove off, I made my way into the Station.  Walking through the bullpen, I saw a large handmade card for Richard on the counter.  After signing my good wishes, I left my purse at my desk and walked into the conference room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some people I recognized; mainly Diane and Kevin, but there were a few people I didn\u2019t know.  I also saw two men sitting across from Diane; who I quickly realized were Bill Donohue and Pat Anders, the weekend anchors.  I wondered where Melanie was until I spotted her playing with some toy cars in the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I went to take a seat, a few of the strangers came over and thanked me for the work I\u2019d over the last few days.  I sat down just as Jackson entered the room.  With the way people were acting around me, I figured she hadn\u2019t outed me yet.  I had to wonder when she planned to make her move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Phil walked into the room with Luke in her arms; I also spotted a lightweight towel covering Luke\u2019s face and half of Phil\u2019s chest.  I didn\u2019t have to be a genius to know she was breastfeeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down at the head of the table, adjusting the blanket with her free hand, Phil said, \u201cI\u2019m glad to see most of us are here.\u201d <br>\r\nLooking around, she said, For the benefit of everyone here, why doesn\u2019t everyone who\u2019s in a different body say your name.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was the first one to speak.  Standing up, she said, \u201cI\u2019m Kevin Sylvester, the station\u2019s political correspondent.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how the Shift will affect the political landscape; what with our president missing and the vice president in the body of a 20-year-old woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Kevin sat down, a woman stood up.  \u201cI\u2019m Brooke Mitchell,\u201d gesturing to Melanie, who was still playing with the toy cars, she said, \u201cMelanie is in my son\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Brooke, as she sat down, I said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, Ms. Mitchell; what\u2019s wrong with Melanie?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cWhen I saw her yesterday, she seemed pretty much like her old self.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems that the news of the Shift being permanent caused Melanie to have a mental breakdown.\u201d Sighing, Brooke said, \u201cShe still has her memories, at least for the moment, but she\u2019s got the emotional maturity of a 5-year-old now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to prove her point, Melanie stood up and walked over to Brooke.  Pulling on her arm, she said, \u201cMommy, I\u2019m thirsty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, sweetie.\u201d Taking a juice box out of her purse, Brooke handed it to Melanie and said, \u201cGo back to playing with your toys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Melanie returned to her cars, I looked at Brooke and said, \u201cWhat does that mean for Melanie?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t see how she\u2019d be able to do her job in her current condition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we came here today.\u201d Sighing, Brooke looked to Phil and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid Melanie won\u2019t be able to continue working here.  My husband and I have decided to raise her as our son; which means, once the schools open up again, she\u2019ll be starting Kindergarten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a pang of sadness when I heard that.  Although I barely knew Melanie, I wouldn\u2019t wish her situation on anyone.  Turning to the one unfamiliar face left, a man in his early 40s, Phil said, \u201cWho might you be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Chad White; your co-worker Richard Thorpe is in my niece\u2019s body.\u201d Pausing, Chad said, \u201cShe sent me here to find out about her employment status.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can tell her that, as far as I\u2019m concerned, she\u2019s been on maternity leave since the Shift.\u201d Looking at Chad, Phil said, \u201cThere\u2019s an on-air job waiting for her when she comes back; or until she decides she doesn\u2019t want it anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad left after that, followed soon after by Brooke and Melanie.  Once they were gone, Phil turned to Bill and Pat, \u201cI\u2019d like you guys to take over the reporting for the next few days; give Diane and Elaine some time off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds good to me, boss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElaine, I want you to interview Dr. Webber one last time before you take some well deserved time off.\u201d Pausing, Phil said, <br>\r\n\u201cUpdate our viewers with that\u2019s going on behind the scenes here, then you and Dr. Webber will be discussing a new angle \u2013 adults who wound up in the bodies of infants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t looking forward to the prospect of working with Jackson, but I didn\u2019t want to let Phil down.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cOkay Phil.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Walking over to Phil, I said, \u201cHow\u2019s motherhood treating you, Phil?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found out why my boobs were so sore; it turns out they were just engorged from not nursing for two days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would definitely do it.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cYou seem to be handling this whole thing pretty well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m trying my best, but I\u2019m still new at this.\u201d Checking on Luke, she said, \u201cI think he\u2019s done; time for his nap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Phil out of the conference to her office; where I saw a crib and a changing table had been set up.  Looking around, I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been busy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe police escorted me to Grace\u2019s apartment last night; let me grab what I needed.\u201d Placing Luke in the crib, Phil said, \u201cFor now, any new moms will be able to use my office for nursing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea Phil, but neither Diane nor myself are due for 9 months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich will give me time to renovate that spare office Keith liked to use with the girls.\u201d Sitting down at her desk, Phil said, \u201cWhen <br>\r\nI\u2019m done with it, it\u2019ll be a deluxe nursery; rocking chairs, cribs, changing tables, soft lighting, and ambient music...the works. I don't want anyone else to come here thinking they need to hide a baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything, Kevin walked into the office.  \u201cElaine, there\u2019s something outside that you need to see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy curiosity was peaked as I followed Kevin upstairs to a patio; one that was usually used for outdoor segments.  Today, however, the patio was full of people looking at something across the street.  I managed to maneuver my way through to the railing, where I saw what everyone was looking at.  There were dozens of people standing in a parking lot across the street, holding a large banner that read: WE <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> U ELAINE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone across the street must\u2019ve spotted me on the patio because soon everyone was cheering and waving at me.  Looking at the crowd, I thought - <i>They love me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stood there, taking in the view, I felt a hand on my shoulder; followed by a familiar voice.  \u201cYou've touched their lives, haven't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, I saw Jackson standing behind me; a smile on her face. </span></div></div>",

Once we took our seats, a technician came over to place our microphones.

My fellow morning anchor, Keith Houseman, has left Channel 7 and will be living his new identity as a Catholic schoolgirl.

Good morning, Dr. Webber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Elaine.\u201d Pausing, Jackson said, \u201cAs you mentioned, things could have been much worse for your colleagues.  We have received information suggesting that many teens, and adults, have ended up with the minds of infants.  This has led to the staggering conclusion that there are teens, and adults, trapped in the bodies of infants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat might be their reaction to such an occurrence?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have no way of knowing for certain; as an infant\u2019s body simply isn\u2019t developed enough to communicate on that level.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the long-term prognosis in cases like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor those infants, who found themselves in older bodies, attempts will be made to help them adjust to their new lives; this includes teaching them to speak, read and write.\u201d Pausing, Jackson said, \u201cUnfortunately for those in infant bodies, there\u2019s no way to tell the effect this will have on them.  It may be that, over time, their minds will regress into infancy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for joining us, Doctor.\u201d Looking at the camera, I said, \u201cFor Channel 7 News, I'm Elaine Sato.\"</span></div></div>",

I started to wonder why they hadn\u2019t been attached to my regular keys until I saw a tag from an auto mechanic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting an idea, I walked behind the building to the entrance to the station\u2019s garage.  Walking down the ramp, I pressed the unlock button until I heard a distant beep echo through the area.  Occasionally pressing the button to ensure I was going in the right direction, I soon found myself standing next to a nice convertible.  <i>I could get used to driving this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting into the car, I made sure to buckle in.  Before I started the car, I took off my heels - I was already inexperienced at driving, I didn't need to throw heels into the mix.  Once I was ready to go, I started the car and pulled out of the garage; waving at Phil as she walked out of the station with Luke in a baby carrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the curfew still in effect, there weren\u2019t any cars on the road; but I still kept an eye on my speed anyway.  So you can imagine my surprise when, as I was turning on to Main Street, a police car came up behind me \u2013 its lights flashing and everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling over, I started to look for my registration as the officer walked towards me.  I was looking through the glove box when the officer said, \u201cHow\u2019s your day going, ma\u2019am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the officer, I did a double-take when I realized it was Brian.  \u201cIt was going pretty well until now.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI could swear I was going the speed limit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I couldn\u2019t resist when I saw you driving by.\u201d Chuckling, Brian said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not in trouble.  I just wanted you to meet someone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian turned to the cruiser and made a gesture; I watch as a woman, about Brian\u2019s age, walked over to me.  As she got closer, I realized she was wearing an EMT\u2019s uniform.  \u201cHow do you do, Ms. Sato?\u201d looking at me, she said, \u201cI\u2019m Amanda Richter; I understand you know my, uh, girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s the father of my baby.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cI want you to know that I don\u2019t want to come between the two of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that.\u201d Pausing, Amanda said, \u201cI just wanted to meet you; since I get the feeling we\u2019ll be seeing a lot of each other in the coming months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like that; my baby can have two very special aunties.\u201d  Turning to Brian, I said, \u201cI just realized, given how the Shift is permanent, I can\u2019t keep calling you Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmanda and I were talking about that last night, actually.\u201d Looking at me, Brian said, \u201cHer girlfriend\u2019s name was Colleen, but I\u2019m not certain I\u2019m comfortable with taking her name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s easier then you might think.  \u201cSo what can I call you then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrianna.\u201d Smiling, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s simple and easy to remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, Brianna and Amanda.\u201d Writing down my address, and phone number, I said, \u201cOnce everything settles, perhaps the three of us can get together.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The general curfew was lifted about a week after the Shift; everyone was encouraged to go about their normal lives.  I suppose I should update everyone about my Channel 7 family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil had changed her name to Felicia and quickly embraced her new life as a single mother.  She loved Luke and would do anything for him.  I noticed that whenever she was breastfeeding, she\u2019d only cover-up if there was a man in the room.  Whenever I, or anyone, asked if she was ready to start dating, she\u2019d say, \u201cLuke demands all my attention and fills my house with odors \u2013 so who needs a man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane had started dating Roger, but people were starting to wonder if they\u2019d last.  The arguments started about a week after the Shift, mostly because Diane didn\u2019t like Roger patrolling the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was now going by Kanika and was settling into her new life admirably.  She\u2019d deny it if you mentioned it to her, but I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s sending signals to her cameraman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019d received an update from Brooke Mitchell; Melanie, who was now going by Robby, was doing well in Kindergarten.  There were times that his old personality would seep through, but Brooke said, for the most part, that he was your typical 5-year-old boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard had become Samantha.  She was living with Chad and his husband Michael, and would frequently call to update us about Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna had settled into a relationship with Rachel; which really changed her life.  She\u2019d told me that she had no idea what she was missing out on being a bachelor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Jacqueline had kept her promise.  She was looking for a new place in town and wanted to strike a better balance between work and her social life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s everything about my Channel 7 family, now I suppose you\u2019ll want to know how much my life has changed.  Boy howdy has it ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally got to see a doctor; a few days after the curfew lifted and was surprised to find out that I was 6-8 weeks along. My doctor said that this was common with women, so I didn't blow my secret right then and there.  I also started seeing an obstetrician, one who had been shifted into the body of a girl who still needed a training bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe told me that my breasts had gone up about a cup size; which made me realize it would be long before my clothes started to get snug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the biggest change was between Glenn and me.  After two weeks of insisting we were just friends with benefits, Glenn said the L-world to me and I said it right back.  So I guess my life is pretty good now \u2013 I\u2019ve got a great job, a baby on the way, and an amazing boyfriend.</span></div></div>",

It made sense when we discussed it; after all, we were always together when we weren\u2019t at work or when Glenn was at the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course that meant having to decide whose condo to live in.  It didn\u2019t take long to figure out that we\u2019d live in my place; after all, I had to the pricier furniture and electronics.  After selling Glenn\u2019s things, we were left with his clothes and his DVD collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would think that Glenn would want my help moving everything; but he insisted that I step back and let him do it.  This, of course, left me with nothing to do but sit and listen to his friends as they came up with new ways to say bro.  Honestly there were times that I found myself forgetting that Glenn had been a 45 year old woman before this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just gotten back from picking up some lunch for myself and four guys.  Having just parked the car, I was walking into the building when my cell phone rang.  When I saw that it was Diane, I answered it and said, \u201cHey Diane, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Elaine, I\u2019m not doing much.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cHow about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlenn is insisting that I don\u2019t help with the move because of the baby.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cSo I\u2019ve been relegated to picking up food for him and his friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s cute that Glenn is taking so well to the boyfriend role.\u201d Chuckling, Diane said, \u201cI remember meeting him a few times before the Shift, he was always looking out for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t really blame him; after all, I moved to a new town and lost my parents in the same week.\u201d Heading into the elevator, I said, \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Glenn, I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m glad you found someone who cares for you like that.\u201d Sighing, Diane said, \u201cI\u2019m getting really annoyed with Roger; he\u2019s still insisting on being a cop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you guys thought about couples counseling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but I guess we could try that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt you called just to chat.\u201d Stepping out of the elevator, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere were just things I wanted to tell you.\u201d Pausing, Diane said, \u201cFirst off, Bill\u2019s sleeping with his wife again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat poor body had been hit by every one of the Aftershocks; at one point I think heard Tara Johnson was in there.  \u201cI thought there was an 11-year-old boy in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is...was.\u201d pausing, Diane said, \u201cIt happened last night; he was getting settled on the couch when she asked him to come to bed.  She had to ask how to do some things; but from what I hear, she was a willing participant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t much I could say about that; after all I was a 15 year old boy in a 32 year old woman\u2019s body who made love to a 45 year old woman in a 25 year old man\u2019s body.  \u201cI get the feeling we\u2019re going to be hearing about that kind of thing more often.\u201d Heading down the hall, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the other bit of news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The parent network is coming to talk to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell them I'm not moving until this kid is at least out of diapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot you and me; the entire Channel 7 news team.\u201d I reached my door as Diane said, \u201cApparently we're one of a handful of markets with a mostly female news team.

It was shocking finding myself in this women's body but the chance that people in my town were in danger gave me something to focus on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sounds seemed to come from a few blocks away and I could see smoke coming from that direction. Walking was very difficult in the purple high heels that Ms. Cho had been wearing and the feel of her dress on my new body was troublesome. I had walked 20 feet before noticing that I still had the camcorder. I considered leaving it as it was heavy but it looked expensive and it might come in handy. On the way I spotted a news van that I assumed Elaine and her crew had arrived here in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When I neared the local gas station I could see what all the smoke was from. A fire had broken out and a few propane tanks had exploded. There were two men and an elderly woman on the ground nearby and they looked like they needed help. I rushed to the woman who kept calling for a \"Jeff\" and saw blood pooling under her leg. Nearly tripping in the heels I leaned down to see how badly she was injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Jeff is that you in there man? What happened? I have some old crows body and I can't get up!\" she gasped hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My name is Evan and something happened to me too. You have a nasty cut on your leg but I can help you\" I said as calmly as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I had taken a few first aid classes last summer in the hopes of getting a job as a life guard. A lot of blood was coming from the cut but I was able to stop it by applying pressure to the artery and tying it off with part of the women's dress. As I was doing this I could see other people helping the two other victims and putting out the fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n A boy around the age of 12 claimed to be a doctor and took over the old woman's care for me. As he checked for further bleeding I talked with the woman to keep her calm. \"She\" was actually the original occupant of the little boys body and was at the middle school having lunch when the event had happened and was in a state of shock. Soon the doctor and a few bystanders put her in the back of a van to take her to the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In the wake of all that excitement I was able to take in the fact that I was now in a early thirties women's body. This is one of the people I would expect to hear about today's unbelievable events from but the real Elaine Cho could be anywhere and she didn't have a camera to report this with. An idea formed in my head, I had taken public speaking classes before and had to write many \"news reports\" for class projects. I enlisted the aid of a man who looked like he could use something to keep his mind off of his new body to hold the camera and film me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello, this is Elaine Cho reporting for channel seven news\". I don't know why I used Elaine's name, it just sounded right from what I'd seen on the local news. \"Citizens all over our town have seemingly changed bodies with each other and this has caused an explosion at a local service station.\" I went on to describe all that I had seen to that point and the stories of the people I had met, particularly the boy stuck in an old women's body. I encouraged people to remain calm and stay at home if they were lucky enough to be inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Thanking the cameraman, I returned to the news van that I had seen. Luckily the keys were still in the ignition, whoever was driving must have fled the scene quickly. I headed right to the news station to turn in my report. I was new enough to driving and the heels were making it difficult but I made it there safely. When I walked in the front door I was greeted by who I thought was Ken Perrise, the stations head anchor, but was actually a producer named Phil. He was glad to see me as he had no reporters and happily took the tape from me to air at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n I watched the report air from a monitor in the control room. The image of Elaine Cho reporting at the scene of an accident was a familiar one but it was odd to think it was me controlling that professional looking woman's body. Phil seemed very pleased with my work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

How would I prove to my family that I was Evan?  Getting to the garage, I climbed into the car and made my way to my house.  The town was less chaotic than I had left it but there were still plenty of people milling about with bewildered looks on their faces. There were few cars on the road, perhaps people had taken my advice and were staying indoors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, I pulled into my driveway and got out of the van. I minced up the walk to the front door and knocked. It was a big relief to see Corrine open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed my report on the TV behind Corinne.  Looking at me with confusion, she said, \"Elaine Cho, what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Corrine. It's me, Evan.\" I said with my now feminine voice. She looked confused but has a revelation of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Corrine, I'm Ryan!\" she said about to cry.  Perhaps it's the fact that we both had female bodies or maybe it was the stress but we hugged each other deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breaking the hug, I looked at Ryan and said, \u201cIs my family here? Do you know what happened to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They\u2019re not here; after I found myself in Corinne\u2019s body I fled the school.

Walking over, I sat down next to him and said, \u201cHe\u2019s beautiful, Dr. Doherty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, Elaine; call me Patrick.\u201d Chuckling, as he wiped some spittle from his baby\u2019s mouth, he said, \u201cI-I can\u2019t believe I just gave birth to this little guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you thought about a name yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t rush me.\u201d Pausing, Patrick said, \u201cI\u2019ve only been a woman for a few hours, and a mother for a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to rush you.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cCan I hold him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Carefully handing his son to me, Patrick said, \u201cBe careful; remember to support his head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I held the newborn in my arms, I realized something.  I started to realize that something had changed inside me; as if holding the baby in my arms gave me an urge to have a baby myself.  Keeping that to myself, I turned to Patrick and said, \u201cI understand you were married before this happened.  Did you and your wife have any children?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t have any children.\u201d Pausing, Patrick said, \u201cMy wife, Helen, was...infertile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Looking at me, Patrick said, \u201cI\u2019d given up on having a child years ago, but now I have one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you been able to track down Helen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d With a tired chuckle, Patrick said, \u201cWhen I do, I\u2019ll bet she\u2019s going to be in for a shock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the baby started crying.  Gently handing him back to Patrick, who started to coo and gently rock the baby, I said, \u201cIt seems motherhood suits you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why; I never imagined myself as a mother before this, but seeing this little guy and holding him in my arms changed everything.  I want to protect him and raise him to be a gentleman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you two some privacy.\u201d Smiling as I got up, I said, \u201cI think they\u2019ll want to me get back to the news desk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about ruining your interview.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem; you had something else to deal with.\u201d</span></div></div>",

About fifteen years had been taken from me along with my gender. How many had found themselves in a situation like mine or worse? I had helped that poor boy that was stuck in an old ladies body and possibly calmed a few people with the news report but there was so much chaos happening that I felt helpless. Was my family safe? How could I even find them? The entire town seemed to be affected but it could be much worse then that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I flipped through the TV channels looking for answers and saw static on every other channel besides seven. The only mass media to begin airing was the one I was in and I was the only reporter there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Phil hung up the phone with a look of urgency on his face. \"Elaine, that was the parent network, they can't find any on-air talent and they want you to report for them\" he smiled. \"The changes happened to almost everyone in the world and they need someone on the air to calm things down. This is your big break!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Channel seven was owned by one of the big three national networks, I was being asked to report to the entire united states and possibly the whole world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"They have an unchanged pilot that can pick us up in 2 hours\" Phil explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was odd to think that despite my now softer voice I could reach the major leagues of news broadcasting with it. The excitement of fulfilling my childhood dreams were tempered by concern however. Thoughts of my family filled my head and I needed to find them before continuing this charade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll do it, but I need to check on my family before I leave town\" I told Phil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I didn't think you had an family here\" Phil replied with a confused tone. \"Don't they live in Korea?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Friends...\" I lamely covered. \"Friends that are close as family\" I said as sincerely as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I understand,\" Phil said as he stepped forward and put his hand on my small shoulder. \"Take one of the vans but make sure you're back in time, people really need you\" he said with a bit to much affection for my liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I thanked him and left the control room. As I headed down the corridor to the parking garage I had more time to think over the situation. All the time in the world could not lessen the shock of turning into a woman and I hoped that my family had had less severe changes than me, perhaps they had been unaffected altogether. I pulled my small frame up into the van and headed to my house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The town was less chaotic then I had left it but there were still plenty of people milling about with bewildered looks on there faces. There were few cars on the road, perhaps people had taken my advice and were staying indoors. The oddest sight was a small toddler dragging a middle aged woman by her hand, she looked out of sorts but the boy's sense of purpose conveyed years of experience in emergency situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually I pulled into my driveway and got out of the van. I minced up the walk to the front door and knocked. It was a big relief to see Corrine open the door.</span></div></div>",

With people having switched in and out of all government installations the quickest way to get things going in the chaos was to shut those down remotely and get all capable personnel in the area to converge on this location as part of a modified plan for continued government operations,\u201d the Major explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cModified plan? What do you mean, Major?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n\u201cIn case of catastrophe the government has a long list of plans for it\u2019s continuance as you might imagine, covering every conceivable scenario. Problem is that no one could have conceived of a scenario like this one. I personally would never have imagined that I would end up in my sister-in-law\u2019s body, but it happened,\u201d he replied gesturing to his unquestionably female body. \u201cWhere are we headed right now?\u201d I asked, feeling a slight buzz of excitement for some reason. \u201cGeneral McMillan wanted to see you as soon as you landed. You were the only unaffected reporter within a fifty-mile radius of the Capital. He wants to bring you up to speed so you can be on the air as soon as possible.  However, we need to get you IDs first so you can be identified inside and outside the Hub,\u201d the Major replied, tapping on the ID resting against the ample chest he\u2019d inherited from his sister-in-law. You hadn\u2019t noticed but It showed two pictures, one was of a clean cut man in an Army Officer\u2019s uniform and other was of the woman you saw before you but in casual office-wear. The ID card also seemed to have his information in bold as well as the body\u2019s original owner\u2019s in smaller letters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you\u2019re in your original body yours will simply have your information, but anyone affected by the switch will have the information for their original self as well the body\u2019s former occupant,\u201d he clarified. The process was simple, but staring at the ID they\u2019d handed me was jarring to say the least. \u2018Elaine Cho\u2019 read the ID card, plain and simple. Now anyone who saw it would instantly believe that I was one of the lucky ones who\u2019d escaped whatever had happened without switching. The slight buzz I\u2019d felt moments earlier died down a bit as the realization of the size of the step I\u2019d just taken dawned on me. Before I could really contemplate what it all meant though, Phil finished being processed and the Major took us to the Central Command area to meet the General. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person who greeted us was ____ in a General\u2019s uniform. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Evan could see a floral design snake its way up from the collar of his uniform to just below his right ear. There were also patterns and designs inked on his hands and a four letter word was tattooed on the fingers on each hand, with a single letter per finger. The uniform hid the rest of the general\u2019s new body, but Evan was reasonably sure that wasn\u2019t the full extent of the ink on the general\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you General. This is my associate and producer, Phil Miller,\u201d Evan said, gesturing to the only person who knew his shiny new badge was a lie. Everyone shook hands and the general motioned for them to sit around an oblong table in the middle of a makeshift conference room. \u201cMs. Cho, I\u2019ll get right to it,\u201d the general did his best to sound commanding, but if anything Evan had to keep from laughing at the strange sight of the teenage girl sitting at the head of the table wearing a 4-star general\u2019s uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt the moment our government is hanging by a thread. I won\u2019t insult you by giving you some sort of spin on the situation. We are trying to get out bearings and coordinate efforts both at home and abroad. Reports are trickling in of pandemonium all across the world and we until we can get some semblance of control on the situation we\u2019re not going to get anywhere. That\u2019s where you come in. We have drafted a rough outline of our plans to get the situation under control, but we need you to communicate this plan and get people to safety so we can start reorganizing in earnest. Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir, I can do that!\u201d Evan assured him with more confidence than he was actually feeling on the inside. \u201cThe major will provide you with the information we want you to cover, but the main thing you\u2019ll have to convey for the moment is that people should stay indoors unless absolutely necessary. The roadways are not safe, we have ordered all planes to be grounded and \u2026\u201d the general went into some detail, but it wasn\u2019t until the end of his briefing that Evan\u2019s ears perked up. \u201c\u2026 and as you saw we already have a plan in place to create new identifications for everyone so that we can safeguard people\u2019s identities. For the time being the process is simplified, in your case your station vouched for your identities, but as we move forward it will be a more involved process and we need you to make it quite clear that identity theft will not be tolerated. The repercussions for those attempting to take advantage of the chaos will be quite severe. Now do you have any questions before we get you on the air?\u201d<br>\r\nEvan felt nauseous after hearing the general. Thankfully Phil put a steadying hand Evan\u2019s shoulder and asked for a few minutes to go over the brief and prepare for the broadcast. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You heard the general! What if \u2026?\u201d Evan spoke franticly, but Phil cut him off, gesturing for the former teenage boy to lower his voice. \u201cElaine,\u201d he said, stressing his new name, \u201cyou heard the general. The whole world is in chaos and you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s stepped up to be the face of this insane situation we\u2019re all in. Like it or not, we are all counting on you to deliver not just the news, but keep things from spiraling further out of control.\u201d Phil grabbed Evan\u2019s elegant, svelte frame by the shoulders and look straight into his eyes as he spoke, \u201cJust imagine what\u2019s going on out there. People have swapped bodies at random, everything we take for granted is up in the air right now and unless You step in front of the camera and give people a clue as to what\u2019s going on and what to do things are only going to get worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan looked up at Phil, who had ended up in Ken Parrise\u2019s body, the head anchor from his home town station. Ken had been born to be a leading man, tall, with chiseled features and steely blue eyes that made you want to trust him instantly. The signals Elaine\u2019s body was sending Evan were confusing and strange, but pleasurable in a way. \u201cI \u2026 I \u2026 you\u2019re \u2026 you\u2019re right Phil,\u201d Evan stuttered as Phil brushed a stray hair off his face. Before things got any more confusing for the boy turned adult woman, Evan pulled away and sat down at a table with the brief the Major had given them. \u201cI should read this quickly before I go on the air,\u201d Evan said, wondering what was going on with him, he\u2019d never been attracted to other guys, but just the way Phil had looked at him and the feeling of his strong hands holding him \u2026 it was confusing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, eh, lets look at the brief and we\u2019ll get you on air in no time,\u201d Phil added, taking the chair opposite Evan and grabbing a few of the papers. There was a hint of disappointment in his voice and for some reason Evan felt a pang of guilt and regret at hearing it. The two of them poured over the documents for a while before calling for Major Peterson to let him know Elaine Cho was ready. They were taken to another tent that had been outfitted with broadcasting equipment, electronics and set pieces so Evan could go on the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are we going to get this out to people? I\u2019m sure not everyone is sitting in front of a TV and even says in the documents you gave me that communications are spotty at best throughout the country.\u201d Evan inquired. \u201cWe have activated the emergency broadcast system, tapped into the cellphone network and we will be broadcasting over old school radio and other frequencies. To be honest, it might not reach everyone, but it\u2019s the best we can do under the circumstances. Some of our communication infrastructure is fairly autonomous so as long as there is electricity, we\u2019re hopeful that people will hear you, Ma\u2019am.\u201d The officer explained, \u201cI guess it\u2019s time then. Phil, would you count me off, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he replied as Evan walked to his mark in front of the cameras.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you are all aware an unprecedented and as yet unexplained event has made the majority of people swap bodies seemingly at random.\u201d Evan felt a sort of out of body experience as he read the teleprompter. This was him, Evan, a teenage boy reading the news as pretty much the only source of news currently in the air and in the body of an adult woman to top it all off. There was a detached part of his mind that didn\u2019t quite believe this was where his life had taken him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs of this moment and until the proper, civilian government has been accounted for and secured the military will maintain continuity of government and ensure security for our citizens.\u201d Phil looked uncomfortable at this piece of the report, but Evan couldn\u2019t focus on that at the moment. \u201dAt this time we ask that those of you who have swapped into or made your way to public building such as schools, libraries , police stations, fire stations, etc. please stay put. These sites will be used as shelters and will start the process of identifying people. We also ask that those who are on the streets head for shelter as quickly and safely as possible.\u201d Evan switched to look at a different camera in what to any observer would have seemed like a practiced motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have reports of power outages and cuts in basic utilities and services. If you are member of a utility provider and are able bodied we ask that you report to your work site as soon as you\u2019re able so we can begin to normalize the situation. We similarly ask that medical, emergency and military personnel present to your closest facility and to triage the situation as needed.\u201d Evan went on for a while detailing procedures in place to begin to control the situation. Though it wasn\u2019t part of the broadcast, the report he and Phil had been given had underscored possible and terrifying scenarios if the situation wasn\u2019t controlled in quickly and effectively. With no one manning the refineries for example, the country would run out of gas in short order. The general had already dispatched personnel to secure the nuclear plants and other dangerous sites around the country, but the situation was highly unpredictable and rapidly changing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo any reporters in the field that are in a position to report on what is happening in your area, please reach out to us through the following,\u201d Evan rattled off different ways of contacting the camp he was in, so they could start building a news network as well as get information for the government to work with. The camera\u2019s turned off and Evan\u2019s new shoulders sagged a little once he was sure he was no longer being recorded. \u201cYou did great Elaine, hopefully we\u2019ll start hearing from across the country soon. They\u2019ve set us up at a nearby hotel so we can get some rest before the next broadcast.\u201d Evan thanked Phil and everyone in the makeshift studio and was glad to for the escort the general provided as they made their way through the city. It certainly looked like it would take a while before things would get back to normal.       <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I stood elevated from all this, overlooking the spacious, smoke-filled room as best I could. It was hard to see much, aside from the general congregation of people stumbling around, leaning up against my platform, their large, hairy arms holding empty bottles of Heineken. Spotlights hung from the ceiling and floors and illuminated me, blocking my vision of the bar but helping everyone else to see me perfectly clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome guy yelled, \"Take it off, baby!\" and I looked down...and nearly fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a woman, first of all, but even worse, I'd transformed into a stripper! I looked to be about five foot eight, two inches taller than my old self, and my body curved and bent in places I never knew bodies could go before. My breasts, as large as melons, strained against the skimpy white undershirt I was wearing, and a white thong rode up my butt and held my crotch tightly, emphasizing the disappearance of a certain old friend. Black high heels kept me teetering and on the verge of falling off, but one of my hands, fingernails painted red, held onto a pole and I managed to remain upright, for the most part. Long, curly, bleach-blonde hair rolled down my shoulders and in front of my eyes, which were surrounded with an excessive amount of mascara and eyeliner, and my cheeks bled with rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a...\" I put a hand to my throat, surprised at my new, sultry alto, and continued staring at the bar around me. I still couldn't see beyond the spotlights, but I could hear a commotion spreading across the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no... I thought. Do they want me to strip down? Do I have to now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her relief, the commotion wasn't about her. Someone yelled, \"Hey, you bastard! That's my body!\" and several similar shouts rang out. The crowd was breaking off, focusing in one area where a fist fight briefly broke out, and then it was heading out the door, panicking, some people screaming, \"What is going on!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this happened too fast for me to register as it happened, but I knew enough to see now was my chance to get out. I let go of the pole and eased myself off the platform, nearly tripping on my high heels several times. It would take some getting used to, I figured, but part of me hoped that all this would turn out to be a dream, and I'd find myself at home, in my sixteen-year old body, with a flat chest, penis, short hair, and smelly, old gym shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the way my breasts shook, pulling on my body as my undershirt feebly pushed them back, told me this was the farthest thing from a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI figured I should head home and see if my mom was all right. Maybe Corrine returned home when things got crazy. I worked through my mind what I'd say to assure them that the half-naked bombshell at their door was their soon Evan, never once wondering if mom and Corrine had changed bodies too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was just about to head outside when a hand fell on my shoulder.

She had curly, black hair and a pair of red pumps that threatened to send her tumbling onto me. I placed my hand on her shoulder, partially to support her, partially to support myself as well. There were tears in her eyes, and she talked slowly and with a strange inflection, like she wasn't used to the sound of her husky, yet distinctly feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, miss, you have to help me!\" she pleaded. \"Whoever you think I am, that's not me, I'm not this...\" She gestured at her body, hesitantly, never looking down. \"You need to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right,\" I said, and I understood why the other stripper was talking so strange. Hearing my voice, high and a little on the nasally side, gave me chills and made it infinitely difficult just to spit out those three words. I wondered who this stripper was, to be so unused to her voice. Maybe she'd been a guy before, like me, or a teenage girl transplanted in the body of a <i>very</i> mature black woman. Whatever the case, while I pitied her, I couldn't do anything to help. \"Listen, uh...I know how you feel, but I can't help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\" The woman fell on her knees and grabbed my legs. It just dawned on me how much more fit I was, how much less flab I had around my thighs. \"I can't be stuck like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't understand. I'm just like you, this isn't who I am. A few seconds ago, I was a kid in high school. My name's Evan Peterson and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan!?\" The woman nearly leaped to her feet, which caused her knees to get shaky as she almost fell on her back. I quickly grabbed her by the arm before she went down. \"You're Evan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, man! Ryan, I'm Ryan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart about skipped a beat. \"Ryan?! Oh my God, you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, it didn't matter that we'd both turned into strippers at some seedy bar that may or may not have been close to home. We hugged each other and didn't let go until the feel of our boobs pressing together got too awkward, but even then I felt much more relaxed. Sure, I might be a twenty or thirty-something blonde vixen, and Ryan's switched spots on the gender and race spectrum, but everything will be okay, I told myself. At least I'm not doing this alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what happened?\" I asked him after we were done laughing and patting each other on the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan shrugged. \"Beats me. One second, I was in the bathroom, unzipping my fly to take a whiz, and the next, well...\" He finally mustered the courage to look down and pat his chest. \"I'm holding these in both hands, in the middle of waving them up and down for some fifty-year old dude breathing down my neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, man, that's harsh,\" I said. \"That's a lot worse than me. I was listening to Ms. Tomlin drone on and on, and then poof! I'm standing up there in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if that's not worse, I mean...it looks like you're dealing with a lot more weight on the boob front.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what you've got ain't bad either, and you're showing a lot more of it than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got to laughing again, but not as loudly as before, and it died down faster. As much as we made light of it, neither of us were the slightest bit comfortable with the bodies fate had given us three minutes before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now, Evan?\" Ryan asked.</span></div></div>",

For all I know, they might be in another state or country even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that means my parents too...\" Ryan's new, softer face grew downcast, and I had to pat him on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay, man. No worries! Once the panic blows over and people find out what's going on, somehow we'll get back in touch with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think they'll accept me like this?\" he said, and though I nodded, I thought the same thing. <i>Will they look at me the same way? Will I see them the same way? Will we have to live our new lives like nothing happened?</i> Still, I told Ryan that it'd be okay, for his sake as well as mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA car skidded to a sudden halt outside the bar, which didn't stop it from crashing into something so loud we both jumped in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do instead?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, these women...\" I gestured to our collective bodies, \"...have to live somewhere. They have to have names, relatives, an identity. The more we find out about them, the easier it'll be to figure out where we go from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some debating, Ryan and I decided to split up and search the empty bar for coats, purses, anything that might belong to us and give a hint of our new aliases. About thirty to sixty minutes passed, and outside the noises came and went, fading in and out depending on where the action was moving. Sometimes cars whizzed by, sometimes we heard people screaming and crying, their voices just as strained and unnatural as ours. It was a struggle to stay calm with all that pandemonium going on, but finally our effort paid off when Ryan yelled, \"Look here!\" and I ran over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the back of the bar, behind an unmarked door, was a locker room filled with perfume, loose clothing, and about a dozen purses. \"Jackpot!\" Ryan said, sounding a little goofy with his thick, African accent. We searched all the purses until both of us found our respective IDs, bearing our respective, new mugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy new name, it seemed, was \"Tanya Garret,\" and I was 28. Ryan was \"Betsy Williams,\" 31. It relieved me to see we were still in our little Indiana town of Red Falls, and we both lived in the same apartment complex, just two floors apart and six blocks away from where Ryan and I lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It almost seems like the switch was premeditated...\" Ryan said. \"I mean, we're both strippers at the same joint, we live at the same apartment complex, we meet each other immediately after we turn into chicks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be,\" I said, \"but we have no way of knowing here. Best to see what Tanya and Betsy's apartments look like, and maybe then we can check out our own houses.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We took another minute to put on some decent clothing, grabbing whatever looked like it would fit in that small locker room. I ended up wearing a green, low-cut blouse and a denim skirt. Ryan got stuck with tight black leggings and a blue shirt cut off at the midriff. \"You'd think these girls would think of wearing more clothes when they're not at their jobs,\" he mumbled, but he still turned me down when I offered to give him my blouse. I admired him for his willingness to march out into the world, showing off skin on his new body, but then I remembered what situation he'd found himself in directly after the swap. He had more experience with baring himself than I (hopefully) ever would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen we left the bar and found ourselves on Apple Street, near the down town area of Red Falls. \"CUTIE'S,\" the neon sign above the bar read, and I vaguely remembered looking at it during my bike rides around town. Right now, the street was covered in crashed cars and people stumbling around, shaking other people, yelling into their cell phones. \"Mommy, I'm scared!\" A bearded man to our left was saying on his phone. \"Please come pick me up, I don't want to be as old as daddy.\" Ryan and I got away from there as fast as we could, not wanting to hear or see any more of that sad sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area around the apartment was the worse, crowded with people trying to get in and out and all about. I felt self-conscious as men, now almost a head taller than me as opposed to a few inches, ran past and knocked me in the ass. It was all an accident, I knew, and nobody really cared how we looked, but part of me still insisted that someone would stop and flirt with me during all this commotion, compliment my tits, play with my hair, remind me of who I had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got inside without incident, however, and found my room, the one on the lower floor, first. Using the key from Tanya's purse, hidden amongst cosmetics, a wallet, and pictures of a man I didn't care to peruse, I opened the door and stepped inside. Ryan followed me as we both stared at the small, decrepit space. There was a bed to the left, a kitchenette to the right, and up ahead a living room area with a TV, balcony, and a couch covered in empty pizza boxes. <i>At least Tanya doesn't mind indulging either,</i> I couldn't help thinking. A bookshelf sat next to the TV, and upon closer inspection housed more romance novels than I knew existed. There were a few pictures as well, all of that man, a few of Tanya at Indianapolis, one of her at the beach in a bikini not too different from her work clothes, and another of her at Disney World kissing Goofy. \"She sure gets around,\" I muttered, and Ryan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe then checked Betsy's room: it had a similar set up, only there was no TV, the couch was clean along with the rest of the room (Tanya's room, in comparison, was pretty sloppy, covered in clothes and crumbs and etc.), and there were pictures of Betsy with her family, stern-faced, not smiling with all her teeth like Tanya did. Ryan found, after shuffling through Betsy's drawers, a picture of Betsy and Tanya in Indianapolis, arms around each other, Tanya beaming, Betsy vaguely smiling. The fact it was hidden, I told Ryan, probably meant the girls weren't on the best of terms before the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like that's about to change fast, huh?\" Ryan grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it was probably because Betsy got jealous that Tanya's prettier than her!\" I said, and made a smooching face at Ryan that made him cock his head to the side and place his hands on his hips in mock outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, girl!\" he said. \"I consider myself a very beautiful lady, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe laughed, then sat down on Betsy's bed and wondered if we'd ever swap back with our old bodies. That line of thinking cast a more somber mood on the proceedings, and both of us were forced to admit, out loud, it might be impossible to go back to being guys. Ryan said he'd go find something else to wear, grabbed some clothes from the closet, and slipped into the bathroom, and I remained seated on the bed, occasionally moving my leg to feel the way it tugged at the edges of my skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat there a few minutes, lost in my thoughts until someone yelled, \"Tanya? What the fuck are you doing in my room!?\" I turned and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I turned towards the door and nearly fell off the bed. There, standing with her arms crossed and a hateful, tight-lipped expression, was Corrine, my own sister. She wore the same clothes she'd put on that morning before school, only they were a little more ripped and ragged now. I could only guess what circumstances had led to the shredding of Corrine's skirt and tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Ryan asked, and he stepped out of the bathroom wearing nothing but a pair of panties. His breasts hung freely while he held the leopard bra from that morning in one hand, and a red, more modest sports bra in the other. I looked back at Corrine, and anger clouded her face from all angles. Her eyes became thin slits, she clenched her teeth, and I quickly got up, disregarding the shift in balance and gravity that came with wearing high heels. For a second I thought Corrine intended to kill Ryan, and I positioned myself to protect him, but instead Corrine slammed her fist against the side of the door and stomped her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you stole my body!\" she yelled. \"Whoever you are, you stole my body and now you're parading around in it like it's your...your...\" Tears welled up in her eyes, and she continued trying to talk, but her words quickly grew unintelligible, partially because of the tears, and partially because her voice was already cracking on the edge of incoherency, a sign I was quickly learning to recognize that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine sunk down to her knees and cried into the palms of her hands, loudly, earning some concerned glances from the rare few in the hallway who weren't panicking into their cell phones. The moment they saw Ryan, however, they moved on, unwilling to dabble in a business involving topless women. Ryan noticed this and shut the door while I walked beside Corrine and placed my arm around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" I said, realizing I sounded like I was talking to a baby. \"Don't worry. Our bodies have been stolen too, and there's nothing we can do. We didn't steal your body, my friend just ended up inside it, all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan, is your sister all right?\" Ryan asked, working his way into the sports bra. \"How'd she know where we were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's <i>not</i> my sister!\" I said, a little more harshly than I intended. \"Well...I mean, she is, but more accurately, she's Betsy in Corrine's body.\" I turned to Betsy, whose tears were starting to die down, and I explained to her our situation: how we were two fifteen-year old boys who, just minding our own business at school, suddenly found ourselves at the bar where Tanya and Betsy worked, in Tanya and Betsy's bodies. We figured out who they were, found their apartments, and were just changing when Betsy appeared. Likewise, Betsy was now in the body of my sister, Corrine, and after I explained my side of the story, Betsy nodded, much calmer and more composed, and told us what had happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was at the bar,\" she said, \"doing my job like I do every Wednesday, and as I bent down to give a show for this one guy, the world flashed white, and suddenly I found myself in a classroom. I hadn't been in school for years, so I couldn't tell if this was high school or college or what, but then everybody around me starts freaking out and wringing each other's necks, saying stuff like, 'you took my body!' and 'who are you?' That's when I looked down, saw I was white, shorter, flatter, and...well...different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People started freaking out at the bar too,\" Ryan said. He stood awkwardly on Betsy's other side, just in his bra and underwear, not sure whether to extend a hand or apologize for being in her body or what. I understood just how awkward the situation must be for him, and hoped he understood how awkward it was for me too. Here was my sister's body, her hair tied back in that same, messy ponytail, her blue eyes looking at me like they always did...only I had to keep reminding myself that behind that familiar face was the soul of a black woman named Betsy, unrelated to me or Corrine, and at the moment a stranger, albeit one connected to us by a strange link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have one question...\" I said, keeping my cool, trying not to be distracted by Corrine's face. \"...while at school, before you came here, did you see anybody with short, brown hair, thick-rimmed glasses, wore an Aerosmith t-shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetsy thought this over, tapping Corrine's fingers on the floor. She stared into space, then stared at Ryan, and finally stared at me before saying:</span></div></div>",

The turmoil inside you was immense. Your mind said this was wrong, but another side, a more primal side was slick with anticipation at the sight of the hunger in the men\u2019s eyes. You made a motion for your companions to take Betsy and leave the room and they close the door behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was awkward at first, and your reticence and inexperience showed but you were soon inside just the scenario that Betsy had described earlier.  There was a pulsing, black, and engorged member inside your pussy, your ass was also being pounded on by another one of the men and the third man was on the receiving end of your first blowjob. It was an experience you would have imagined, let alone thought you would enjoy, but with every thrust you understood Betsy more and more. Your body shook with pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a hunger inside you that you hadn\u2019t been aware of before, but now that it had been awakened, you were ravenous. \u201cMaybe this isn\u2019t going to be so bad after all\u201d you thought for a moment as you all switched positions so each guy could have their turn. The tattooed man had his penis between the giant orbs on your chest, making you truly appreciate having them for the first time.

Taking tentative steps out of the stall, you walked over to the bathroom\u2019s mirror. The heels you were wearing were even taller than the previous ones, but you managed to mince your way over without falling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman staring back at you had creamy-smooth, tan skin, large, almond-shaped, brown eyes and luscious, large, red lips. Her curves had obviously been surgically enhanced, giving her breasts that defied gravity, especially with there not inconsiderable size and a derriere that would probably give Nicki Minaj a bit of envy, all connected by a tiny waist and perfectly contoured abs. Before you would have given anything to be with a woman with such amazing legs, but this was far past whatever fantasies you might have had before.

How\u2019d I\u2019d get here? Oh my God, I don\u2019t understand!\u201d the woman said hysterically. \u201cMiss, I don\u2019t know either, I was in my classroom one moment and the next I was here, in this stripper\u2019s body,\u201d you explain, holding the hysteric woman by her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Wait, I was in class too! Were you in High School? My name is Corrine,\u201d she yelled excitedly, shaking me like a ragdoll. \u201cCorrine? That\u2019s my sister\u2019s name! I\u2019m Evan! Is that you, Corrine?!\u201d I screamed in disbelief, hugging her and becoming instantly aware of my new anatomy. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this, Evan, is that really you in there?\u201d she asked, looking me up and down, as though she just noticed me now. \u201cYes, it\u2019s really me,\u201d I replied, patting my newly acquired body, giving her a bit of an apologetic look, as though this was my fault somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is incredible, I don\u2019t understand, how are we in these women\u2019s bodies?\u201d she asked, looking down at her new body and then looking around the bar with some of the hysteria climbing back into her voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t think we were the only ones, look around,\u201d I told her, motioning around us. The bar was in chaos, many of the man had been so drunk they were only now starting to figure out something was wrong, patting themselves and asking the same questions Corrine and I had been asking each other. Many of the other strippers were stumbling around and the noise outside probably meant the bar wasn\u2019t the only place going through whatever this was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a clue what is going on, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re safe here. We need to \u2026 \u201cI paused, trying to figure out a plan, \u201cwell, I was going to head out, but I think I should find some clothes first.\u201d I finished, tugging at the flimsy material of my outfit. \u201cUh, yeah, you definitely need some clothes, I would guess there must be some sort of locker room in the back of this place, there\u2019s no way anyone would walk in and out of this place dressed in just that,\u201d she said, pointing at my thong. \u2018My thong,\u2019 there\u2019s something I never expected to think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave her a nod and a half-hearted smile, and we made our way through the crowd of scared and shocked people. We made it to a door in the back, hidden by some curtains and it struck me that I was walking in the sky-high heels now with ease. When I first got the stripper\u2019s body the heels were one of the first things I noticed and I could barely walk in them, but after talking to Corrine I guess I forgot about them and the body\u2019s muscle memory must have kicked in. I definitely did not feel sure-footed, but I could manage so long as I didn\u2019t think too much about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis way Ev. I think I found the dressing room,\u201d Corrine said, motioning towards a doorway to our left.

The face on the screen was the same as the one reflected in the mirror on the makeup table, minus the tinge of fear in my reflected eyes. I looked around and saw a purse and some clothes strewn about the table top, that I guessed belonged to Brandi too. Corrine also found her body\u2019s stuff on a bench in the back of the room. I looked around for a moment and decided there was little choice but to put on the clothes I\u2019d found. It was not too much of an upgrade, a pair of cutoff shorts, a white t-shirt with \u201cKiss me\u201d scrawled on it with a big kiss stamp over my new and bountiful boobs, a pink, zip-up, hoodie that did nothing to cover my new body and a pair of pink and white open toe heels that were only marginally lower than the ones I\u2019d originally found myself in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrine just found a leather jacket and a purse, but her outfit was relatively normal compared to my stripper outfit or lack thereof when the switch happened. She looked at me for a moment and was about to say something when we heard the sound of glass bottles breaking and things getting smashed coming from the main bar area. We looked at each other in a panic and she grabbed me by the hand, leading me out the door and towards the back of the bar. I looked around half expecting someone to jump out of nowhere, but somehow Corrine and I made it to a metal door with a faded sticker that read \u201cExit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were both blinded by the brilliant sunlight for a moment, but after a moment my eyes adjusted and I saw that we\u2019d made it to a back alley. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d asked Corrine, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I was following you.\u201d I replied, feeling like we\u2019d been incredibly lucky to have made it so far without much of an issue. \u201cHey, I got us this far, it\u2019s your turn to think of something. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but I don\u2019t think staying in the streets is going to be too safe,\u201d she said, looking around the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I found my new body\u2019s driver\u2019s license, her place isn\u2019t too far from here, we could go there and catch our breath for a bit,\u201d I offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we go home and see what\u2019s happened to mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHome is on the other side of town, do you think we can make it there with all that\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but \u2026 umm \u2026 let\u2019s \u2026\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, a horn blared out; somebody plowed their car straight into oncoming traffic. There was a loud <i>bang</i> and debris from the accident scattered across the street in front of the strip club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we're not safe out here.\" I grabbed Corinne's hand and pulled her away from the scene. A few onlookers were gathering nearby, while others continued running about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's total chaos out here...\" My sister remarked numbly. She seemed to be in a state of shock. Stumbling on her heels a few times, she quickened her pace to keep up as I led us to Brandi's townhouse. By a stroke of luck, I recognised her address since it shared the name of a local bar in the downtown area. The same bar where Ryan (my best friend) and I sneaked in and had a few drinks together for his sixteenth birthday. Ryan's older brother worked at the bar and somehow managed to get us in without even so much as a fake ID. I briefly wondered whether they got swapped too and if they were okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like whatever happened to us, happened to those people too.\" I pointed a french-tipped nail at two joggers on the other side of the street. The man and woman appeared to be husband and wife. However, the man stuffed his hands down his pants, feeling around vigorously while the woman berated and pushed him. Their behaviour appeared totally out of character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few blocks later, Corinne and I advanced up to a postbox with Brandi's address engraved on the side. I rummaged around her purse until I found her house key and unlatched the iron gate leading to her doorstep. We climbed up the stairs, entered Brandi's home, locked the door, and cracked open the windows to get a view of the pandemonium unfolding outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kicked off Brandi's open-toed heels and unzipped the pink hoodie, glad to be rid of the fuzzy skin-tight fabric which seemed a size or two small for her bountiful bust. I felt like an intruder in a stranger's home... but that paled in comparison to intruding upon that same stranger's <i>body</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the commotion is dying down for now,\" I reported, still gazing out the window at the street below. A few gunshots rang out which caused me to flinch. \"Never mind. We'll be alright here as long as there's food and water. Corinne?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around. Corinne was staring in a full-body mirror in the living room. She was sniffling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second I had to remind myself that this sexy, mature vixen was actually my baby sister, a 14-year old girl. We were only 9 months apart in terms of age -- my mother always used to comment how we 'Irish twins' were a throwback to our Irish heritage -- but I always saw Corinne as a little girl. I had to be strong. Strong for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tenderly embraced her in a hug, calmly reassuring her things would be all right. I'm not sure how convincing it was, between the sensation of our breasts mashing together or me having to look up at Corinne in my new diminutive form (realising how tall I felt in those platform heels earlier!) But she rubbed her eyes, smearing some mascara, and stopped sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she said something truly surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn... I really need a cigarette.\" She sighed. Grabbing a half-full pack of menthol's lying on the kitchen table, she fished out a cigarette in one hand and held a lighter in the other. She placed the cigarette between her lips with her index and middle fingers, in a motion so fluid and natural it was as if she smoked all the time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corinne, what are you doing?!\" I exclaimed. She positively <i>hated</i> those self-described 'cancer sticks'. She had said it reminded her of Dad. She said it was because of him why she had that anti-smoking poster in her bedroom. That totally cliche poster affixed to the walls of every single grade school classroom ever: the one with all those animals with cigarettes dangling out of their mouths and the subtitle mocking how stupid it looked. This, I reminded myself, was the girl who actually took all of that anti-drug indoctrination rubbish seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she only gave me a sad smile. \"When you were gathering Brandi's stuff, I grabbed this lady's purse. She smells like a smoker... and so do you now, it seems.\" Flicking on the lighter, she ignites the tip until it glows orange. She draws in her breath, her perky tits rising and falling within her crop top as she exhales a cloud of smoke from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I watched her take another drag, something inside of me jolted awake. Of course! The smoky strip club... the saturated clothing... the pack lying on the table. Brandi was a smoker too. Probably takes the edge off seeing all those horny guys leering at her all day like a piece of meat, I realised. Whatever the reason, my heart accelerated and my mouth got painfully dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI <b>need</b> one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've got to have a cigarette <b><i>right now</i></b>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can you give me one please?\" I mumbled as she handed me the pack and lighter. And before long I, too, was greedily sucking on the filter of a fresh cigarette. Tasting the delicious tobacco in my new mouth and lungs. Feeling the rush as I exhaled out my mouth and nostrils. Ashamed of succumbing so easily to one of Brandi's addictions, but gaining a new level of empathy for smokers and how hard it seemed to resist the urge previously coursing through my new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no denying how <i>good</i> it felt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure hope there's no smoke alarm in this dump.\" I chuckled, tapping some ashes into an ashtray next to the windowsill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad, Evan,\" Corinne replied, joining me to stare out the window. A different cloud of smoke billowed out of the nearby cathedral, possibly from a fire. \"Think of it this way: You've got your own place now. Haven't you wanted to live on your own for ages?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed harder at that. Then with a tinge of irony, \"I <i>was</i> planning to move out in a couple years. Maybe turning into a hooker has its benefits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a hooker... you're an exotic dancer.\" Corinne suggested casually before taking another drag. Now <i>that</i> was something I never thought my sister would call me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe smoked in silence for the next few minutes, staring out the window rather than at ourselves or each other. Corinne stubbed out her cigarette and went to change into something more comfortable (and less revealing than her current leather miniskirt and crop top) while I tried calling home. No answer. I tried calling Mom's cell phone. No answer. Ryan, Kyle, Oliver, Paul. The rest of my friends whose numbers I could remember, not being able to rely on my old phone and contacts list. No success. It wasn't long until I discovered that Brandi's cell service was down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if that wasn't bad enough, all the local channels on Brandi's old 1990s TV set were a black-and-white peppery static. Some of the movie channels still functioned, though that was likely because they were pre-programmed before this... thing... happened. Whatever it was, it didn't just affect the school, the strip club, and the town. I got a sinking feeling in my stomach at the possibility that this was much bigger than I had previously thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorinne returned from Brandi's bedroom wearing a pair of sweat pants, long-sleeved shirt, and tied her black hair up in a ponytail using one of Brandi's scrunchies. The clothing was baggy enough to conceal most of her curves, though I suspected it would be a losing battle for my own surgically enhanced T&amp;A. I wasn't 100 percent certain they were fake, but after viewing enough porn in my relatively short pubescent life I could guess with reliable accuracy. Corinne had also washed the makeup from her new face, revealing a fresh complexion with a lot of natural beauty. The woman's blue eyes shined brightly just like Corinne's used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you gonna change into something a little less... revealing?\" She asked me after I told her of my fruitless attempts to get more information from Brandi's cell phone and TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tugged at the hem of Brandi's cutoff shorts, frowning. \"Yeah. I dunno... guess I was kind of expecting to wake up by this point and it wouldn't matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think we'll be... stuck like this... do you?\" She asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuck like this? No way!\" I put on a cheerful tone. \"If a lot of people got swapped, then there's got to be someone working on a fix as we speak. I bet we'll be back in our old bodies by tomorrow and we'll have a good laugh about it later!\" My confidence seemed to reassure her once again, but I wish I could believe it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I remembered that just a instant ago I was listening Mr. Tomlin boring lecture and suddenly I found myself in, by the looks of the place, a hospital room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an instant, trying to make sense of this I believed that maybe I just fell unconscious by the lecture and was brought to the school infirmary. \u2018But why I am on the floor?\u2019 I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confusion in my head was fading, so finally I stood up and that was the instant a realized that I wasn\u2019t myself anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019m a woman! But how could this be real?\u2019 I was in shock. One thousand crazy ideas came to my mind trying to understand this nonsense, but the feeling of my new boy something was sure: this wasn\u2019t a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no visible mirror at the room, but from what I could see in that moment: I have an average breast, brunette (I deduced by some of the locks that fell into my face) and, somehow young by the look of my new hands. I was wearing a light blue outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just when I was going to explore a little bit deeper a panic scream brought me to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-What the hell has happening! \u2013A woman shouted from one of the beds. \u2013Why am I a pregnant woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I want my mommy! \u2013The woman in the other bed started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Please stay calm. \u2013I began to tranquilized them, but even I got even more stressed by hearing my new female voice. I breathed deeply. \u2013Please, try to stay calm. It won\u2019t be good for you and your babies\u2026 -\u2018What was I saying!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Babies! What a f\u2026 -The first woman shouted me. \u2013I\u2019m a man and look me! How could you ask me to be calm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening but we won\u2019t get anything good by loosing our mind! \u2013I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You are a nurse! You must know something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then I realized that I was stuck in the worst place I could be during such catastrophe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I\u2019m not a nurse! \u2013I imposed me over the woman\u2019s screams. \u2013Just a moment ago I was a guy in high school. \u2013I breathed again. -So, please, make me the favor to stay calm until we know what\u2019s happening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was out or my nerves, but at least I make the man/woman to shut. But the other woman was another story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a really long time to calm her. I could know in that moment her before gender, but by her way of act and speak I could deduct she had been a kid about five years old. It was kind of frustrating deal with such a situation, but something inside me knows how and what I must do, and somehow I like to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second woman finally calm down an fell sleep. And noticing this the first one started talking me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sorry for that last. \u2013She apologized with a crying tone. \u2013But\u2026 Well\u2026 this is not what I was expecting when I woke up. \u2013She laughed and so I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I can\u2019t understand that. I would have never imagined I would become a female nurse to day at the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I\u2019m Evan Thompson, -I realized; -or at least I used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I\u2019m, -she sympathized; - was Jeff Kline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe just laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Then what do we do now? \u2013She asked me.</span></div></div>",

I can\u2019t find any topic to continue the conversation.

So I spent the time look the hospital room. And then my eyes stopped at file at the down part of Jeff bed. I took it and try to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was curious; even if I couldn\u2019t understand most of it, it felt comprehensible and I could get an average idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Would you like to know who are you now? \u2013I asked Jeff shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t answered immediately, but finally told me. \u2013Maybe that\u2019s a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Ok. You are Sara McDougal, you are thirty-four years old and you are expecting twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Twins! \u2013She repeated as trying to deny what I told her.<br>\r\n-Yes... Congratulations? \u2013I told her with hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe covered her face trying to stay calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Does the file say something more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I don\u2019t get it clearly, but it looks like Sara began labor about three weeks early, so she was hospitalized in the prenatal wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Does it say when was she\u2026 me hospitalized?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked again the file, and found an amazing answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-About three weeks\u2026 -I responded astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-So it means I might give birth at any minute! \u2013She shouted through her hands trying to cover her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Please, try to calm down. \u2013I sat by her side and caressed her silky black hair. \u2013Please, try to breath and clam yourself. You might enter in labor if you don\u2019t calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sobbed a little bit longer, before she fell sleep as the woman in the other bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting anxious. \u201cWhat would I do if they really enter in labor?\u201d I tried to calm myself. Breathed deeply and looked for something to distract my stress. At first I thought in turning on the TV, but I just remembered it would be troublesome if the woman/kid awoke and began to sob again. My breath became quite irregular when, suddenly, I noticed a plastic under the shelf beside the place I woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached and look it. It read: Karla Knudsen, nurse, obstetric wing, Piedmont Hospital. \u201cSo my name is Karla.\u201d I thought. But what tracked my attention the most was the picture of the beautiful brunette nurse. By the look I must be around the late twenties, and by what I could see through my new eyes and the picture, I was getting really curious about my new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just when I was thinking in restart my body examination, a teenager girl, about her fifteen enter the room wearing a doctor\u2019s gown and behind her a told black man.</span></div></div>",

One minute everything is just fine, and the next, everyone is going off about how there in the wrong body. Thankfully it seams that most of the staff is still here. Even if there not in the right body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" I started \"but I'm not Karla. Before this happened I was a normal guy in high school named Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry about that\" the nurse said. \"I was good friends with Karla, and we lived in the same apartment\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a slight pause the doctor said \"Well, my name is Samantha Becker, and this is Jill Johnson. If you need us, odds are we won't be far\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hay Doc\" Jill said \"How's about I take Evan here to go and find Karla?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you could\" Samantha said. \"Just try and be quick. We need all hands on deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we have enough people here right now, plus some people are even trying to keep others calm so we can do our jobs.\" Jill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two of you left the room. Jill took you to an area of the hospital you had never even seen before. However, when you got inside you realized it was just a changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we doing here?\" You asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple\" Jill said. \"We can't leave the hospital in these so we need to change first. Karla's locker is right next to mine and we have the same combo on our locks. Get changed quickly so we can go find her ASAP\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jill opened your locker you were shocked. The only clothing in the locker had been Karla's gym clothes and some a ice hockey warm-up suit (you love watching  college and pro ice hockey and wish you could play, but your like the only one at your school). You first pulled on her black running short , then the tight green compression shirt. You then put on the warm-up pants, followed by the warm-up jacket. The jacket had your school logo and the #29. Then you pull out here street shoes and realized why your feet felt so weird. You had her socks with the individual toes on under her hospital shoes and when you saw her street shoes it all made since to you ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004T5L9SE\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004T5L9SE...</a> ). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seamed Jill could read your mind as she said \"Sorry, but Karla had planed on going to the gym as soon as she got off today. Usually she only went 4 out of 7 days, and on those 4 days, she comes to work in her gym clothes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not mad, just startled\" I said. \"I didn't think anyone else in this town liked hockey\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only did she like it, but she played and still holds the record in her school for goals and points in a season, \" Jill added. \"She was our schools best player and played on our varsity team all four years of high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is so cool\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went out to Jill's car and headed to my school. The ride was longer than normal because of the fact that the roads were just kayos with cars wrecked on the shoulder or in the middle of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're only half way there right now\" Jill started. \"but you should call your old body's cell phone. If Karla is in your body, we should find out where she is and tell her to stay there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea\" I said. So I called my own body. It rang for about a minute before I heard my old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, this wouldn't happen to be Evan would it?\" My voice asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, is this Karla?\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I used to be Karla\" my voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, well not not cool as in cool but cool as in we found you. Where are you?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made it back to my apartment\" Karla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, the apartment is like 10 minutes from here. Karla stay where you are and start packing your clothes\" Jill said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why\" Karla and I asked (speaker phone).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, this way we can bring all of your clothes to Evan's house, get his, and you two don't need to buy new clothes\" Jill explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea\" Karla said. \"I'll start packing right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were later than expected to the girls apartment because of all the cars that had crashed in the road. But when we got there, Karla had almost everything packed. And there was a lot of clothing. When I saw all of it I was surprised by how she could pack it all into the boxes so quickly. Really all that was left was her shoes. Thankfully she only had like 10 pairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you pack so fast?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. We were in the process of moving anyway. Because I started early, I finished very quickly\" Karla stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wanted to find a place close to the hospital. We were thinking of a place maybe 30 or 45 minutes closer. This way we would have more time to get ready for work\" Jill stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe quickly finished up with packing and got it all in the car. We then headed out for my house. It was a relatively short drive, only about 10 or 15 minutes. After we got to my house, we quickly learned that nobody was home. I grabbed the spare key from under the mat and unlocked the door. We then proceeded to bring in all of Karla clothing and unpacking it. Then we quickly packed all of my old clothing and put it in the car. Once we were finished, Karla and Jill left for the hospital leaving me all alone. I locked the front door and began putting all my new clothes away in my closet. I had only been at it for maybe five minutes when there was a knock on the front door. I looked out the window and saw my schools principal, Mrs. Jackson. She was only in here late twenties, just a few years older than I was now. And she is a really cool person. She was almost never in her office, in fact I can't think of a time I had seen her in her office. Right when I was going to open the door I heard her say \"I can see you in there. I don't know who you are but this is my house. My name is  Corinne and live here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment I flung the door open and said \"Corinne it's me, Evan. I was swapped into the body of a nurse at the hospital\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, is your old body here? And what is up with all the boxes?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, her roommate who works at the hospital took me to get all of this body's clothes and she took all of mine and left for the hospital\" I explained. I then went on to explain everything that happened to me today. Then she went on to explain how she ended up in Mrs. Jackson's body and how she was asked to tell everyone to go home and how everyone and their parents would be emailed three days before school would be starting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't we finish unpacking your new clothes\" Corinne said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you? What will you where?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me. I think moms clothes will fit me\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, we herd the house phone ring. I picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, this is Evan. Who is this?\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan, honey this is mom. I'm just calling because I might not be home when I said I would be. You see as I'm sure you know, almost the whole world changed body's\" the woman on the phone said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, who's body are you in?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know my coworker Kate? Well we were staying together for the conference and we switched body's\" my mother replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to refresh our memory, Kate is the blond women that is like 35 years old right?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is. But she is 33\" my mother answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool\" I said. \"Just FYI I'm now in the body of a nurse named Karla. She is 27. Corinne is in Mrs. Jackson's body. Do you have any idea when you might be home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'll bet the airport will be closed for at least 3 to 4 weeks. The store should open before you run out of food. Hopefully. Tell your sister I love you for me\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K. Love you to mom\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, we were on our own.</span></div></div>",

After a moment of not knowing whether or not I should answer I accepted the call. \u201cHello\u201d I said, completely unsure of who was on the other end of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSamuel, please tell me that\u2019s you in my body\u201d I heard a man\u2019s voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, sorry. But I\u2019m not Samuel\u201d I said. \u201cMy names Evan\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap. Ok, Evan, stay right where you are and I\u2019ll be there as soon as possible ok\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. But who is this?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy names Karla. And your in my body, so don\u2019t go anywhere before I get there\u201d the person on the other end of the call said just before hanging up on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, ok\u201d I said as I put the phone back in the pocket  I found it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d Jeff asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently, the woman who\u2019s body I\u2019m now in. She said she\u2019s on her way so you should be fine once she gets here\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff and I talked a little bit more until he grew tired and went to sleep. At that point I took the moment I had to myself and stepped into the rooms bathroom. I was curious what I looked like right now. And to say I was shocked by the person looking back at me in the mirror was an understatement. She had delicate ears that framed a cute button nose. A set of dazzling, angel-white teeth that gleamed every time I moved the natural pouty lips she had. Her eyes were a deep blue color and looked even better with her beautiful brunette colored hair that stopped an inch or two on her shoulders. Her body was covered by a very unflattering light blue nurses clothes she wore, so I removed the top which exposed a very tight all white v-neck t-shirt that did a much better job of showing off her sculpted figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 5 minuets of careful explanation of the body I was now in I put the blue top back on and left the bathroom, where I sat back down in the chair next to Jeff\u2019s bed. No sooner had I sat down the door opened and a male nurse walked into the room. \u201cEvan?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d I said as I stood up out of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief, the man said \u201cok, that\u2019s good. I\u2019m Karla, the original occupant of that body\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here. Although I wish it could be under better circumstances\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, any idea how this happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a clue\u201d Karla replied. \u201cWe\u2019re just glad that for the most part all the doctors and nurses only switched with each other. But we are preparing for a massive influx of people because it\u2019s crazy outside\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you think its safe enough for me to  leave to check up on my family\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea. First of all, just from a brief glance outside it\u2019s crazy outside. Something terrible could happen to you. Secondly, right now your dressed in my scrubs and I\u2019d hate for you to get mistaken for a nurse and forced into a situation you have no idea how to handle\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what should I do?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay here. When I get a chance I\u2019ll bring you my change in clothes and when everything calms down I\u2019ll take you home. In the meantime keep these two relaxed, but find someone if something happens. Can you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, no problem\u201d I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can\u201d Karla said as she backed out the door and shut it behind her. And with that I was alone again with the two people who weren\u2019t pregnant women when they originally woke up today.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My body, along with the math class around me, shattered into millions of minuscule pieces. I watched the fragments of my body from within the void, like a formless soul, as they hung out in the distance, shimmered for a moment, and then came flying back, restructuring themselves around me in a slightly different form. The fragments of the world did the same, putting themselves back together, but not as my high school classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen reality asserted itself, I found I still sat in a classroom, only it was wider...<i>much</i> wider...a lecture hall, even! I sat at the very back at a long desk of fellow students, looking incredibly bored and scribbling in their notebooks while the teacher droned on about genetic modification or something like that. Everyone looked too old to be in high school, with lots of beards and larger muscles for men, and larger breasts and more mature faces for most of the women, and they all wore shorter, thinner attire: tank tops, tube tops, t-shirts...not clothes I expected people to wear during an Indiana winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes fell on the giant symbol of the speaker: \"UF.\" I recognized it quickly from all my college searches this year. <i>The University of Florida!</i> I thought. <i>I'm at the University of Florida! I'm at the...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm a girl!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nModest-sized breasts stuck out from behind a figure-hugging pink t-shirt. Black, denim short-shorts barely reached down my leg, reminding me more of boxer-briefs than any shorts I'd ever worn, and I could feel the frilly panties beneath them tickling my new womanhood. My softer skin was a deep tan from all the times I'd spent out in the sun, and my dark-blonde hair, long and curly, flowed down my shoulders and partway down my back. Several strands fell in front of my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't wearing shoes, but two black sandals sat below my chair. A cosmetic mirror sitting beside my <i>GENETICS AND MEDICINE</i> textbook informed me of my new, angular chin, small black eyes, and fuller lips. Also on the desk was a purse, overflowing with cosmetics and school supplies and a college ID: \"JULIA WRIGHTMORE,\" it announced, beside the picture of my new, grinning face. \"UF SOPHOMORE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as all the facets of my transformations had finally sunk in, another student in the hall yelled, \"Wait...who am I?\" and soon the professor had stopped his lecture so he could pat himself down and burst into confused tears. Chaos and commotion broke out as many students ran across the hall to shake another by the neck while others just abandoned the hall completely, and then there were some just sat glumly in their chairs, feeling their breasts, cupping their crotches, or staring off into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm not the only one who changed,</i> I figured, and it occurred to me that this Julia Wrightmore might be in my old body right now. All I have to do is fish her cell phone out of her purse or wherever it is, call my number, and see who answers. Or, the more I thought about it, I could probably get more information about where to go from here if I found someone in this lecture hall who knew me. That shouldn't be too hard, right? Find the calmer students still hanging around and ask them if they know me, whether they can lead me back to my dorm? They'd be a better help than Julia if she was in my body, separated from me by several states and over a thousand miles.</span></div></div>",

Out of shock at what you just thought you start to get scared. Noticing the look on your face Julia comes over and hugs you. You feel his (or rather her) muscles pressing against you, his chest pressing down on your your breasts. Out of character your hand slips around him and hugs him tightly, before you push yourself forward.... backing off you exclaim \"No, get off me I feel weird. Do you still have feelings for John?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep thinking of kissing him its freaking me out, help me\" you began to sob...  </span></div></div>",

Getting up from the seat, I walked over to an Asian girl sitting a few rows in front of me.  Placing my hand on her shoulder, I said, \"Excuse me.  Do you know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just about to ask you.\" looking at me, the girl says, \"One minute I was at lunch talking with my girlfriend and the next I'm in some Asian chick's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could help.\" smiling, I said, \"I don't even go to this school, let alone live in this state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asian girl, who I realized was a guy, said, \"I gotta go, man.  My girlfriend is probably worried sick about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as the girl grabbed her things and left the room.  I spent the next few minutes asking the others in the room but they couldn't help me either.  I was about to give up when I heard a guy's voice call out.  \"Julia!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning in the direction of the voice I saw a guy, walking towards me, with a cute muscular... \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>What am I thinking!?</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the guy, I said, \"D-do you know me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guy walked towards me, I noticed that he was walking like a girl...swinging his hips.  \"Jules, its me Ashley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry, but I'm not Julia.\" pausing, I said, \"I'm Evan Peterson from Indiana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're a guy!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" pausing, I said, \"At least I used to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Evan, I'm Ashley Connors.  Somehow you switched bodies with my roommate, Julia Wrightmore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief chat, Ashley and I decided it would be best to head to the apartment she shared with Julia.  We both grabbed our things; it felt weird carrying a purse; and left the classroom.  Walking out of the building, Ashley says, \"Our apartment is a couple blocks from here.  I'm parked next door, but it'd probably safer if we walked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the walk to the apartment, I looked around the campus.  \"I always wanted to go here; but not like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, Ashley chuckles and says, \"This probably doesn't make for a good first impression.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully we got to the apartment a few minutes later.  We encountered a lot of chaos on the way.  Both Ashley and I were glad to be in the safety of the apartment.  Placing our things on the kitchen counter, I said, \"What should we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about you.  But,\" walking to the fridge, Ashley says, \"I could use a drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ashley took out a can of Budweiser, I said, \"Could you grab one for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm thirsty, and the first thought that popped into my head was, <i>I need beer.</i> It felt like something Ashley would think often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Ashley tapped her fingers on her arm. The humorous look in her eyes was gone, replaced by a perplexed, deliberating expression. She nodded, took a Budweiser can from the fridge, and tossed it to me. I snatched it, opened it, and took a big, healthy swig. The taste, sour and bubbly, repulsed me instantly, but Julia's body didn't seem to mind too much. I didn't feel the burning or fuzziness they say comes with drinking for the first time. Ashley also chugged on her Budweiser, finishing it in one gulp. She crumpled the can and tossed it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Evan,\" Ashley said. \"Julia's quite a drinker, more than I ever was...though that's changed now.\" She belched, a moment of levity we both chuckled at. Then, more seriousness. \"I think, now that we're in different bodies, that person's urges become our urges. What their body is used to rubs off on our mind, so the thought comes naturally and we don't question it until afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, slowly. \"Huh...\"</span></div></div>",

As I look down at my feet I notice I'm dressed very smartly in a navy skirt suit. My legs are smooth and there is no hair in sight, a pair of sheer tan tights polish off my look and hide my pale legs. This is the look of a girl who works in an office. I felt the need to investigate my new body further; so far I wasn't really freaked out by what had happened to me, somehow this felt good. A nearby store had mirrors in it; I checked my reflection and I had become a thirty-something girl with average perky breasts and a slim sexy figure. I looked good and my shoulder length blonde hair and sparsely applied makeup were stylish and refined. This was my chance to start afresh and I decided that being a woman was what I wanted now and I would steal this body for good. I was on an all time high, elated in fact. Whilst in the store I went on a shopping spree buying a whole new wardrobe at the time. I bought bras and knickers, tights, stockings, skirts, dresses and blouses. I had a whole load of gorgeous shoes and bags along with makeup and hair products. If I was going to be a woman I was going to be a very well turned out and very feminine one. My favourite attire is skirts and dresses and I love wearing tights with them.....I never knew it felt this good being a girl. The downside was the fact I felt bloated and moody. It was about time for my period and this meant it was time for me to research my new female genetalia....that's right, I needed to become familiar with how to wear a tampon in my new vagina. Luckily the instructions were self-explanatory and I managed without a hiccup. Although having a vagina is quite strange but at the same time nice. I saw a guy in the office the other day (apparently he used to be a middle-aged woman called Laura) and I got a nice warm tingling down below. I really like this guy but he's a work colleague plus I've not yet been with a man before and I'm not sure I'm ready for a relationship yet. I decide to bite the bullet and one day I wear my sexiest lingerie under my best work dress....it's just above the knee and is dark pinstripes. I want to look my best so I make sure my legs are alluring by wearing my favourite natural look sheer tights which look great and feel so soft and smooth to wear. I spend an age perfecting my hair and makeup and finish the look with some nice court shoes. I polished my nails the night before and so I'm ready to ask this guy out when I see him at work. With all the chaos of the last month or so I really need this.....but how will he react - maybe he isn't happy with the result of the great shift. Maybe, unlike me, he hasn't embraced his new self and taken to his new identity.....</span></div></div>",

You hesitated to take them off almost sure that your new feet wouldn't last long against the asphalt and ramrods. Sighing, you decided to keep them and continued escaping from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets were a mess and completely bizarre picture. By one said there were lots of people arguing vehemently, then there were also people touching themselves unashamedly and the cherry in the cake was seeing kids trying to comfort grown ups crying like babies; not forgetting the fact that your were now a woman wearing skirt and high heels in the middle of that same surrealistic image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no time to think too much out the subject. You need to hide before you ended in the middle of that chaos anticipating a war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran, or walked as faster as your new shoes let you. And with each step everything get worst around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like crying, even though it was not part of your normal nature, and you blamed being a girl now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long it took you, you didn't know, but finally you found a door open at an alley with not one fighting of doing other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went there and gulped unsure of what you would find there.

But not line, as expected of such a sci-fi setup. You breathed again and continued. Make up, agenda, glasses, a broken hand mirror and lots of things for what looked like a little purse; but you found what you were looking for: a wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least three hundred dollars, nothing out of the world; some credit cards and exactly what you wanted to see, an ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSahara Kurtson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name didn't tell you a thing, but the photograph helped you more than the broken mirror. Sahara was quite good looking and by turning to see your blouse, she had nice assets. <i>So that was the reason behind all that people touching themselves</i>. You deducted, sighing knowing that wasn't the time for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look at the other two things you wanted to know. Twenty-six, that was your age now. And the most important thing: New York City, that is where you were now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed trying not to cry again when something happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Are you ok?\" A girl's voice called you from the stairs not so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" You mumbled. \"Who's there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk later, come here, this place isn't safe.\" She hurried you before going upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to think, but it was useless in your actual circumstances and you followed whoever that girl was.</span></div></div>",

The first thing I had to figure out was what could've caused something like this; I mean it's not every day I find myself in the body of an attractive pregnant woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I placed my hand on my suddenly pregnant belly, I felt the baby kick from inside.  I couldn't help but wonder if the baby had been affected by whatever did this to me.  I was just starting to relax a little when a 12 year old girl came barging into the back of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god you're still here, LeAnn!\" Seeing me, she said, \"Come quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught off guard by the girl's mature tone of voice, I said, \"Wh-What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Amelia.\" Sighing, she said, \"I woke up in this body; and the former...occupant just woke up in mine, only she's fainted from shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I slowly got out of the chair, I said, \"Take me to her, I'll see what I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia led me back out into the front of the restaurant, where I saw a small group of people standing around the unconscious body of a women in her 30s.  As I looked at her, I suddenly understood why the poor girl had fainted; considering what body I found myself in, she likely fainted from the shock of suddenly being 20 years older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bent down to check her pulse and make sure she was still breathing; letting out a sigh of relief when I saw that she was.  Hearing sobbing next to me, I turned to find a middle aged woman crying in the nearby booth; it didn't take long to realize she was the girl's mother.  As another waitress comforted her, I said, \"We'll make sure your daughter is alright, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women simply nodded in acknowledgment; as the other waitress, a teenage girl, looked at me.  \"What's going on here, LeAnn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Sighing, I said, \"What I do know is that I'm not LeAnn; my name's Evan and I'm from Maryland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...nice to meet you, Evan.\" Pausing, the girl said, \"Despite my current...appearance, I'm actually Carl Raymond; I'm one of the cooks here at the restaurant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...Carl.\" pausing, I said, \"Can you help me get this woman's daughter into a nearby booth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some help from Amelia and a few other customers, all of whom had swapped with each other, Carl and I got the daughter into a nearby booth.  Once that was all done, I sat down to take a breather.  Sitting down next to me, Carl said, \"So, you're not from around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I'm from outside Baltimore.\" Sighing, I said, \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I live in town.\" Chuckling, Carl said, \"I'm not even supposed to be here today; I called out sick with the flu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know which of those is worse; having the flu or finding yourself in a girl's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now it's a tossup.\" With a chuckle, Carl said, \"If you don't mind, I'm going to call my apartment and see if Melissa is alright in my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Carl went into the back of the restaurant, Amelia came over to me.  \"You did a great job there, LeAnn; I never realized you knew all of that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because I'm not LeAnn; I'm Evan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, you're a boy?\" shocked, Amelia said, \"It must be quite a shock being in a pregnant girl's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got that right.\" Gesturing to the girl in Amelia's body, I said, \"How's she doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name's Kristy; and it seems like she's doing alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything calmed down over the next hour or so; especially after Kristy regained consciousness.  After one of the other patrons noted that they shouldn't really stay in the restaurant, I realized that I needed a safe place to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Amelia preoccupied with Kristy and her family, I went to find Carl.  After a few minutes, I found him in the break room.  Sitting next to him, I said, \"Did you get in touch with Melissa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did.\" Sighing, Carl said, \"She's not happy about being in my body; but then again I'm not happy being in hers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that; but at least you're in a familiar area.\" Sighing, I said, \"I live a 1000 miles from here; I've got nowhere to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true, Evan.\" Looking at me, Carl said, \"LeAnn lives in an apartment complex with her boyfriend 5 minutes from here; it's not ideal but you could go there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see how that conversations going to go.\" Pausing, I said, \"Hi, I'm some boy in your pregnant girlfriend's body; can I spend the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's better than nothing, Evan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over for a moment, I decided that Carl was right; given the situation, it would be best if I stayed with LeAnn's boyfriend.  Once I got the directions from Carl, I decided to make my way to the apartment.  After grabbing LeAnn's things, I said goodbye to the remaining patrons and walked out of the restaurant.</span></div></div>",

It made me feel better that LeAnn's apartment was close to the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked down the street, I occasionally caught glimpses of panicked people running around; calling out for loved ones.  I tried my best to avoid them; but that failed when an 8 year old girl in a soccer outfit ran up to me.  \"You've got to help me, I-I can't find my daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was momentarily taken aback by the absurdity of that statement when I realized whoever was in this girls body was probably her father.  Bending down to her level, I said, \"Okay, where did you last see her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was taking her to a dentist appointment when suddenly everything went black and I woke up in her body.\" Starting to panic, the girl said, \"Sh-She probably ran off in fear; not knowing what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing some screams and loud noises nearby, I turned back to the girl and said, \"I don't think it's safe out here; come with me and I promise we'll find your daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we resumed our walk to LeAnn's apartment, the girl introduced herself as Eric Brockwell.  Despite the fact that he was now in his daughter's body, he was shocked when I introduced myself as being a former boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at my pregnant belly, Eric said, \"I imagine being in a pregnant woman's body is\u2026shocking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you could say that.\" Chuckling, I said, \"I haven't even had sex with anyone yet; and now I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe reached the apartment building a few minutes later to find that it was almost completely untouched by the looting and mayhem around us.  As we walked inside to find an elevator, I had to wonder what I was going to do from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before we reached the floor that LeAnn lived on.  We eventually found her apartment; trying the door to find that it was locked.  Turning to me, Eric said, \"Do you have a key or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me look, I don't know.\" As I searched through LeAnn's purse, I turned to Richard and said, \"When we go inside, I want you to stay behind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think I should go in first?\" Raising an eyebrow, Eric said, \"I mean, considering the fact that you're pregnant now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah; but don't forget you're in an 8 year old girl's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Eric was about to say something, the door opened to reveal a worried looking man in his mid 20s.  Seeing me, he said, \"Thank god you're alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at him, I said, \"Listen, I-I'm not who you think I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already know you're not my girlfriend, Evan.\" Getting Eric and me into the apartment, he closed the door and said, \"I got off the phone with LeAnn a little while ago; she called and told me what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got me at a disadvantage; I don't even know who you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Kyle Mason; LeAnn's boyfriend.\" Gesturing to Eric, Kyle said, \"Who's she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Eric Brockwell; he found himself in his daughter's body.\" Wincing, I said, \"I hope you don't mind; but I said he could stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" Pausing, Kyle said, \"It's probably safer in here anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Kyle, Eric said, \"Can I, uh, use your bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, it's down the hall on the right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Eric went to use the bathroom, Kyle helped me to the couch nearby.  As I sat down, I said, \"So what happens now?\"</span></div></div>",

The news outlets were calling the event the Great Shift and it apparently affected almost 90% of the world's population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe would occasionally stop and look out the window when we heard a noise outside; like a car crash or someone screaming.  Kyle looked to be the most nervous of the three of us; making sure he kept Eric and me safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Eric, the situation was starting to take its toll on...her; as she started to feel drowsy, she leaned against me and fell asleep.  I wasn't sure if it was the situation or the fact that I was now a pregnant woman; but I felt the need to protect Eric and keep her safe.  After she'd fallen asleep, as Kyle's suggestion, I carried her into Kyle and LeAnn's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was tucked in the bed, I walked back to where Kyle was sitting on the couch.  Sitting down next to him, I said, \"This must be weird for you; with me being in your girlfriend's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's weird; but I'm just glad that everyone's safe; even if you're in her body and she's in yours.\" Looking at me, Kyle said, \"It must be weird for you being pregnant all of a sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea, man.\" Chuckling, I said, \"I haven't even had sex with a girl yet; but here I am suddenly pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked as if he was going to say something else until he caught himself.  Taking a breath, he looked at me and said, \"You must be all sweaty and dirty from what happened today.\" Pausing, he said, \"Why don't you go take a shower while I start dinner for the three of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Kyle, I said, \"You're okay with me...seeing your girlfriend's body naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I wasn't okay with it, I wouldn't have suggested you take a shower.\" Pausing, Kyle said, \"Besides; until they find a way to reverse this...Great Shift, it's technically your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just thought I\u2019d check.\" Chuckling, I said, \"Thanks.\"</span></div></div>",

Seeing myself in the mirror, I wondered how LeAnn looked before she got pregnant. <i>Pretty sure her calves and ankles were distinct,</i> I decided. <i>I've got to find out how to fix that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a shower felt really good, and I was glad Kyle suggested it. He seemed like a good man. I could picture him as a father. The problem was, I had no idea what kind of mother I'd be, if it came to that. I wished I had someone to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I realized, I did. \"Hello in there,\" I said to the baby I was carrying. \"I haven't seen anyone acting like a baby, so maybe whatever did this only affected those who were able to understand what was going on. In any case, I hope whoever's in there is the same as before this... Great Shift, and you're accustomed to hearing this voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thing is, I'm not who I was when you were conceived. This morning, I was a teenage boy named Evan, and I lived in Maryland. Suddenly, here I am, a pregnant woman in Lubbock, Texas.\" I chuckled. \"I've never slept with anyone, and I'm going to have a baby. Weird, huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, baby, I've got to learn how to bring you into this strange new world, and I don't have a lot of time to do it. Maybe they'll figure out what caused this, and reverse it. Not just for me: There's a man in his daughter's body in the living room with your daddy, and we have no idea where she went in his body. I guess what I'm saying is, if I screw things up, try to take it easy on me, okay? I've never done this before, and I was never even brought up to consider being a momma as a possibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I toweled off, I went to LeAnn's dresser. Finding a nightgown that wasn't too revealing, I slipped it on and went to rejoin Kyle and the former Eric.</span></div></div>",

It was not at all surprising to see that, considering this place looked to be part of a high priced condominium complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing the door, making a note to find out what Kyle did for a living, I turned the water on and started taking off my clothes.  Seeing myself in the mirror, I started to wonder what LeAnn looked like before she\u2019d gotten pregnant; no doubt she was a very <br>\r\nattractive girl before all this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the tub was filled, I slowly stepped in and lay back in the tub; marveling at how the water seemed to take off the weight of my stomach.  I sat in the tub for a while, thinking about everything and wishing I had someone to talk to about what I was dealing with.  <br>\r\nThat was when I realized that I did...the baby I was now carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello in there,\" rubbing my stomach, I said, \u201cI hope that you\u2019re not affected by what has been happening; hopefully you got lucky like your father and are accustomed to hearing this voice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was as lucky as him; since I\u2019m not the same person I was when you were conceived.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI was just some teenage boy from Maryland; I\u2019ve never slept with anyone and now I\u2019m suddenly a 24 year old pregnant woman in Texas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway baby, I don\u2019t know if this is permanent or anything; but if it is then I have a lot to learn about being a woman and a mother <br>\r\nbefore you\u2019re born.\u201d Smiling to myself, I said, \u201cWith that said, don\u2019t hold it against me if I mess things up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you with that, Evan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, I turned to find Kyle standing in the doorway carrying some fresh clothes.  \u201cH-How long have you been standing there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLong enough to know how uncertain you are about all this.\u201d Placing the clothes on the counter, Kyle said, \u201cI\u2019m responsible for you being pregnant; so I\u2019ll help you where I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Kyle.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cNow...uh, could I have some privacy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, sorry.\u201d Stepping towards the door, Kyle said, \u201cI\u2019m cooking some dinner; I hope you like lasagna because that\u2019s what LeAnn\u2019s been craving lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good,\u201d reaching to open the drain, I said, \u201cI know you\u2019re used to seeing this body naked; but can you please leave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Kyle left the room, I climbed out of the tub and proceeded to dry off.  As I dried my hair, my thoughts went back to just before; <br>\r\nwhen I was somewhat abrupt with Kyle.  As I started to get dressed, I made a decision to apologize to Kyle for my attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter struggling for a few minutes with the bra, I was fully dressed in a pair of stretchy pajama pants and a top that did nothing to hide my new baby bump.  Walking into the main room, I saw that Eric was awake and watching a news report from the couch.  As I walked behind the couch, I ruffled up her hair and said, \u201cYou feeling better, Eric?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs best as I can be, considering everything that\u2019s going on.\u201d Sitting up, Eric turned around and leaned against the back of the couch to look at me.  \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that I\u2019ve had a relaxing bath, I\u2019m feeling much better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good; I\u2019m glad.\u201d Smiling, Eric said, \u201cI\u2019m still in shock at my change; but I can\u2019t imagine how this is affecting you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, I walked passed Eric and made my way into the kitchen where Kyle was stirring the sauce for the lasagna.  Leaning against the fridge, I said, \u201cHey, you got a minute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Looking at me, Kyle said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I wanted to apologize for what I did in the bathroom; I\u2019m still in shock about all of this and I wasn\u2019t expecting someone to be watching me naked in the tub.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing to apologize for; I should have knocked.\u201d Looking at me, with a smile, Kyle said, \u201cYou\u2019re not really my girlfriend, so I have to accept that I can no longer see that body naked or anything like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we should set some ground rules; so you don\u2019t barge in on Eric or me when we\u2019re taking a shower or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree; but lets not do that now.\u201d Sighing, Kyle said, \u201cToday\u2019s been stressful enough already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing how stressed Kyle was, I couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for him.  With nothing else to do, I reached over and pulled him into a hug.  Kyle hesitated for a moment before embracing me; which served to not only calm the two of us down but, to my <br>\r\nembarrassment, make me a little turned on.  Breaking the hug, I turned to Kyle and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this; all three of us.\u201d</span></div></div>",

We communicated with LeAnn a few times to make sure my family was alright; learning that mom had swapped my dad, my dad was now a girl from Corinne\u2019s homeroom and Corinne was lucky enough not to have swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, however, long distance calls became impossible so I was cut off from my family.  It did give me a chance to get to know <br>\r\nKyle and Eric.  It turned out that they both worked for the same investment firm in the city, but in different departments.  I could not help but wonder why Kyle, an obviously successful man, was dating a waitress from a nearby diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe assured me, however, that LeAnn had been going to school to be a paralegal when she got pregnant; putting her plans on hold for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, it was the Monday after the Shift and I was walking out of the bathroom just as Eric was getting off the phone.  He had been calling friends and neighbors since Saturday in an attempt to find his daughter but with no avail.

Realizing I could not keep it up much longer, I said, \u201cOh; what the hell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kyle could react, I pulled him in and gave him a passionate kiss on the lips.  It didn\u2019t take more than a few seconds before Kyle reciprocated; we kissed passionately on the couch for what seemed like an eternity, neither of us wanting to end the moment.</span></div></div>",

Getting out of bed, I looked over to find that Eric was already awake and out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked into the bathroom, I found it amusing how I was skittish about sharing the bed with the rightful boyfriend of this body but was okay with sharing it with a 32 year old man in a little girl\u2019s body.  Once I had relieved myself, I walked down the hall to the kitchen where I saw Eric eating a bowl of cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs had become a bit of a joke between us, I ruffled Eric\u2019s hair and said, \u201cGood morning, kiddo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning.\u201d Looking up from his cereal, Eric said, \u201cYou\u2019re in a good mood this morning; what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle and I talked last night about LeAnn; and we, uh, kind of made out of the couch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you kind of make out on the couch?\u201d looking at me, Eric said, \u201cYou either did or you didn\u2019t; which is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay; we did make out on the couch.\u201d Seeing the surprised look on Eric\u2019s face, I said, \u201cIt was a spur of the moment thing; I was so wound up by this body\u2019s hormones that I just kissed him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute...you kissed him first?\u201d confused, Eric said, \u201cI thought you were into girls, Evan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was, I mean I am into girls.\u201d  Pouring myself some orange juice, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not really sure anymore; especially after I found myself in the body of a 24 year old pregnant woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we\u2019ll figure things out as we go along.\u201d With a chuckle, Eric said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worse that could possibly happen; it\u2019s not like you can get pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, I said, \u201cOh very funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, as I was drinking the orange juice, Kyle walked into the condo.  The kiss was clearly on his mind as well; because I noticed him blushing a bit when he saw me.  Seeing the look on his face, Eric said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Kyle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just got off the phone with a friend at the local hospital; they, uh, found your daughter.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Kyle said, \u201cShe must\u2019ve gotten into some kind of accident after the Shift; because doctors say she fell 15 feet onto a concrete sidewalk not far from here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d Shocked, Eric said, \u201cI-I she going to be alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle glanced at me silently; I knew the answer immediatetly and it wasn\u2019t good.  Turning to Eric, Kyle said, \u201cHer injuries were quite severe; it\u2019s not likely that she\u2019ll live through the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough for Eric to simply blackout and fall to the floor.  Rushing to his side, I picked him up and held him in my arms until he regained consciousness.  Tears streaming down his face, Eric said, \u201cPlease, you have to get me to the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do; my neighbor down the hall is a cop, so he can get us through the roadblocks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Kyle left the room, I found my maternal instincts kicking in once again.  Holding Eric close, I said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be alright; we\u2019ll get you to your daughter, Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to speak, Eric buried himself in my arms and cried.</span></div></div>",

Eric hadn\u2019t left the bedroom since then, understandably upset about the turn of events in his life.  Kyle and I were started to worry about Eric; he hadn\u2019t eaten in two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was sitting on the couch, reading a book on pregnancy, when Kyle walked into the condo carrying some shopping bags of food.  Putting the book down, I walked over to the kitchen and looked into the bags.  Glancing at Kyle, I said, \u201cGuess there wasn\u2019t a whole lot to choose from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, I was lucky to get what I could.\u201d Sighing, taking some bread from the bag, Kyle said, \u201cThere were a lot of people taking advantage of the government alleviating some of the curfews.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I could have gone with you and gotten more food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw several fights in the grocery store.\u201d Placing a hand on my baby bump, Kyle said, \u201cThere was no chance I was going to endanger you or the baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to feel cooped up here, Kyle.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m being a surrogate mother to a grown man in the body of an 8 year old girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking past me to the bedroom door, Kyle said, \u201cHe\u2019s still in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s still in there; although I guess we really can\u2019t blame him.\u201d Looking at Kyle, I said, \u201cYou knew immediately that LeAnn was okay; imagine being in Eric\u2019s position where it took several days to find out what happened to his daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what he\u2019s going through; but he should know we\u2019re both here for him.\u201d Pausing, Kyle said, \u201cHe\u2019s an adult, he should know not to keep his emotions inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to say something, when I heard Eric\u2019s voice behind me.  \u201cDo you guys think this is easy for me?\u201d taking a breath, Eric said, \u201cNeither of you can imagine what it\u2019s like to know your daughter is dead; I have to look at her face every day for the rest of my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, neither of us know what you\u2019re going through.\u201d Walking over to Eric, Kyle said, \u201cBut Evan is in the boat as you, he\u2019s dealing with a life altering incident same as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, that\u2019s not the same; Evan has you for emotional support.\u201d Sighing, Eric said, \u201cWho do I have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean I have Kyle for emotional support?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that you guys are both attracted to each other; I\u2019m sure if I wasn\u2019t here, you guys would have been sleeping together by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not really attracted to Kyle; it\u2019s because being pregnant is messing with my mind.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cSure, we made out for a while; but that was a spur of the moment thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, maybe I\u2019m completely off base.\u201d Pausing, Eric said, \u201cBut the point is that I\u2019ve got no one who can be emotionally supportive of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong.\u201d Glancing at Kyle, I said, \u201cWe\u2019re here for you; I mean Kyle is keeping both of us safe and fed.  I was shifted just as you, so I have a very good idea what you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was clearly too much for Eric; because before Kyle and I could do anything, he collapsed to the floor in tears.  I immediately ran over to him and held him in my arms.</span></div></div>",

He was a sweet guy, making me breakfast in bed every morning and giving me massages at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days after we decided to change our relationship, the government dropped the curfew and allowed everyone to go back to work.  That meant I was back at the diner and Kyle was back at the investment firm, while Eric stayed in the condominium until he could figure out what he wanted to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought he should go back to school in his daughter\u2019s place and take the second chance he had been given with the Shift, while Kyle thought he should continue working at the firm.  The three of us were not the only ones dealing with drastic changes from the Shift.  Carl, the man from the diner who had swapped with a female coworker, had become a single mother after learning his girlfriend had shifted into a 7-year-old boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long day at work, interacting with people still dealing with their changes, I was glad to be safely home with Kyle and Eric.  <br>\r\nWalking through the front door, I saw Kyle cooking dinner and Eric watching TV.  Seeing me, as I placed my purse on the counter, Kyle walked over and kissed me on the lips.  \u201cHi babe, how was work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was interesting; it turns out our situation isn\u2019t the weirdest one out there.

Looking at us, he said \u201cWhat are you going to make official?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Eric and said, \u201cI think we should tell him, babe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you have no living immediate family; you\u2019re legally an orphan.\u201d  Looking at Eric, Kyle said, \u201cEvan and I were discussing what <br>\r\ncould be done for you; and I decided that I would start paperwork to adopt you as my daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d bursting into tears, Eric ran over and hugged Kyle.

Some might think that is a little insane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so because I gave into this body\u2019s urges that makes me insane?\u201d getting agitated, I said, \u201cYou and I both agreed that we <br>\r\nshould start dating; because you loved LeAnn and I\u2019m currently in her body.

I pulled myself out of bed and made my way to Grace's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a hard time seeing my feet, so I couldn't walk as fast as I wanted to. But I made it, and knocked on her door. \"Grace, honey? Can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the door, and found that, as I expected, Grace was crying. \"What's wrong, honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"After my wife died, I thought that the worst thing about someone dying was that I wouldn't see them anymore. Now,... \" She started up again. \"Now my little girl is dead, and I see her face every day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brought her into a hug. \"I can't say that I know what it's like to lose someone like you have. But I think I can see where you're coming from. LeAnn is probably still alive, in my old body, but I haven't heard from him since this whole mess started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up. \"N-not at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. From everything Kyle and the Conroys have said, it sounds like she just isn't interested in this life. Somebody else is having the baby she didn't want, and working the job she hated, and that seems to be all she cares about.\" I gave a chuckle. \"I can imagine how my mom is reacting to her antics, though. And it's not pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight smile came to her lips. \"A real technocrap, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the kind who won't 'tech-no-crap' from anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed. \"Yep, that's my old mom. Of course, Mama Conroy isn't exactly a pushover, so I don't know if LeAnn will reform anytime soon. But I can hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kissed her forehead. \"Feeling a little better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to the bathroom, grabbed a bottle of aspirin, filled a glass with water, then returned. \"When I got real upset at night, Mom would give me an aspirin, so I could get back to sleep again. Here you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the aspirin, washing it down with the water. \"Thanks,... Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did my heart such good to hear Grace call me that. \"You're welcome, sweetie,\" I said, and kissed her forehead again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put the empty glass back in the bathroom, and waddled back to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was waiting for me. \"Is she okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting there.\" I told him what she and I had talked about, right up to her calling me Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're making quite the family, aren't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm-hmm. Not how I imagined it would be. But I'm glad it's mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, since we're both still up, what do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled my nightgown off over my head. \"I can think of something.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm the baby's father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you, Kyle. Now, LeAnn, let me start off by saying that, for the next couple of months, I will be seeing you every two weeks. This doesn't mean that there is necessarily a problem with your pregnancy, it's just that we want to get in front of anything that might happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, LeAnn, your blood pressure is elevated. It might be just a little too much stress, but we want to make sure. Ready for your first ultrasound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready,\" I said. \"I've got this feeling like it's a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor smeared cold goop on my belly, then rubbed a wand over it. \"Chalk one up for your instincts. Looks like he's doing fine so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said my blood pressure was up. Could that hurt him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Under certain circumstances. If it turns out to be preeclampsia, we'd need to be very careful. For now, let's see if you're just under too much stress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm putting you on a strict resting policy for now. You can continue to go from here to there, but you must sit down whenever you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's going to be a problem. I'm a waitress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, I recommend one of two things: The first is to go on maternity leave early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I can't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need to quit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't looking forward to not working at the diner anymore.

Since they were now father and daughter, I recommended that they at least acted the part.  It gave me some time to myself; which I used to clean the apartment and do some laundry.  As I walked back into the apartment carrying a hamper of clothes, I couldn\u2019t help but think that I truly was adjusting to the role of a mother and girlfriend.<br>\r\nI was busy folding some of Grace\u2019s clothes, hoping that a ketchup stain had gotten out of her soccer uniform, when I heard a ringing noise coming from Kyle\u2019s laptop.  Walking over, I saw that I was still logged into Skype from when I\u2019d called LeAnn\u2019s...my parents earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, I was surprised to see the call was coming from my old Skype account.  Wondering what was going on, I answered the call and was greeted with the face of Amber Reilly, a girl from school who was the definition of a dumb blonde.  \u201cAmber, is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d Giggling, the girl said, \u201cI know I like totally look like Amber; but I\u2019m really Ryan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRyan?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cWhat are you doing in Amber\u2019s body; I thought you ended up in Olivia\u2019s body after the Shift?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was like this aftershock thingy a few days after the Shift; and I totally found myself in this body afterwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had heard that the Baltimore area had been hit by an aftershock; but I was confused as to why Ryan was talking just like Amber did.  \u201cThat explains a few things; but why are you talking like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really like know for sure; I guess it\u2019s like because Evan, I mean LeAnn, thought it was better this way.\u201d Giggling, Ryan said, \u201cHe\u2019s like my boyfriend and all; so I wanted to make him happy.  I\u2019ve like been doing this for so long, I can\u2019t stop; my parents are totally worried about it but I could care less.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re basically just like Amber?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cWait a minute...you\u2019re dating LeAnn, in my body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah; it\u2019s been great.\u201d Pausing, Ryan said, \u201cShe...I mean he must have this thing for blondes or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get back to that later.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cHow come no ones contacted me until now?  I\u2019ve been calling for weeks without answers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvan totally told us that you didn\u2019t want anything to do with us; but I guess I like didn\u2019t really believe that.\u201d pausing, Ryan said, <br>\r\n\u201cBesides; I like totally miss you.  It\u2019s too bad you\u2019re not up here; we\u2019re both good looking girls, we could totally get boys to get us anything we wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to happen; I\u2019m in my third trimester and my doctor put me on bed rest until the baby is born.\u201d  Getting worried about the mental health of Ryan, I said, \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve already got myself a boyfriend and the guys in Baltimore aren\u2019t really my type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s too bad; I was hoping to like get to know you again.\u201d Pouting, Ryan said, \u201cEver since John was shifted into a baby down the street, I\u2019ve had like no one to hang out with besides Evan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Corinne?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone totally native ever since she shifted into the body of John\u2019s dad.\u201d Pausing, Ryan said, \u201cShe hasn\u2019t told anyone; but I\u2019m like sure she\u2019s sleeping with John\u2019s dad now that he\u2019s in shifted into his wife\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking more about what was going on at home, apparently my mom was adjusting well to being a teenage girl again, I turned my attention to a concern I\u2019d had since Ryan called.  \u201cRyan, I have to ask you this.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cHave you actually...gotten dumber since the shift?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god; you totally sound like my parents now.\u201d Frustrated, Ryan said, \u201cJust because my grades like totally dropped to Cs doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m stupid.  I may talk like I\u2019m some ditzy blonde, but I\u2019m like totally smart still.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh, prove it.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cTell me what you should do if a cop pulls you over for speeding and wants to give you a ticket?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s an easy one.\u201d Gesturing to his chest, which was barely contained in a bra that was obviously one size too small, Ryan said, \u201cShow him my breasts and hope I can convince him to give me a warning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not right at all, Ryan.\u201d Frustrated, I said, \u201cTell LeAnn to call me later; I would like to speak with...him about why he\u2019s okay with you turning into a dumb bimbo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I am not a bimbo.\u201d Upset, Ryan said, \u201cI like may not be as smart as you anymore; but I\u2019m totally better looking than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks aren\u2019t everything, Ryan.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cCome on, you\u2019re turning into Brian\u2019s ditzy ex-girlfriend on Family Guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m totally smarter than Jillian.\u201d Getting angry, Ryan said, \u201cYou know what, I think you\u2019re like totally jealous that I\u2019m better looking <br>\r\nthan you and have a much better boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil now I\u2019d been more than able to control my emotions; but hearing Ryan insult the father of my child, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore.  <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you ever insult my boyfriend; he\u2019s better man than even you were before the Shift.  He took me into his home even though he didn\u2019t know me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo he\u2019s a better man, huh?\u201d scoffing, Ryan said, \u201cI guess he like didn\u2019t tell you how he hooked up with LeAnn, did you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he did actually.\u201d I knew  I was lying, Kyle and I hadn\u2019t talked much about our past lives since we became a couple.  Looking at Ryan, I said, \u201cHe met LeAnn through a mutual friend; and they started dating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s totally not how it happened, LeAnn told me what really happened.\u201d  Looking at me, Ryan said, \u201cIt seems your boyfriend was such a loser that no girl would ever go one more than one date with him; LeAnn decided to have pity sex with him one night.  That\u2019s why she hated being pregnant; because she regretted the decision to sleep with him in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of this; I\u2019m 7 months pregnant, I don\u2019t need this kind of aggravation.\u201d Getting up, I said, \u201cHave LeAnn call me later; so we can settle this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, bitch.\u201d  Getting angry, Ryan said, \u201cYou can bet Evan won\u2019t be happy when I tell him how you treated his girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnding the call, I let out a frustrated groan as I walked away from the computer.  As I tried to calm down, I felt my son starting to move around.  Placing a hand on my belly, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, sweetie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I worked to calm myself down, I knew Kyle wasn\u2019t going to be happy when I told him what LeAnn was saying about him.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d narrowed my choices down to three different courses; and was looking at one of them when I saw Grace walk out of her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that while Grace had accepted that she was a kid again, she had not quite accepted that she was a girl; which was why she was wearing a pair of Transformers pajamas.  Turning from the laptop, I looked at her and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, kiddo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking about Dad and you were saying in the car about how a person who was Shifted takes on the personality of the person they become.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cDo you really believe that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence, just from seeing you and me, to see that it\u2019s true.\u201d Picking Grace up, which was no small task considering her size and my pregnancy; I walked over the couch and sat down.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cHow else would you explain why I, a teenage boy, so quickly fell in love with an older man; and why you blush every time you see Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-What!?\u201d shocked, Grace said, \u201cI-I don\u2019t like Kevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say you liked him.\u201d Grinning, I said, \u201cI said you blushed every time you saw him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Grace said, \u201cOkay maybe I do like him a little; I mean we\u2019re both adults in the bodies of children.\u201d Blushing a bit, Grace said, \u201cYou don\u2019t think that\u2019s weird, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird that Kyle and I are dating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, that\u2019s not weird.\u201d Chuckling, Grace said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen how happy you guys are together; it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re meant to be <br>\r\ntogether.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, I looked at the clock and saw that it was getting close to 9:30.  Turning to Grace, I said, \u201cWe should get you to bed, kiddo; we have orientation at school tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Leaning over, Grace kissed me on the cheek and said, \u201cGoodnight mom.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d also never thought I\u2019d be 8 months pregnant; but that\u2019s another story entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle and I were walking through the school with Grace; who seemed to know where she was going.  It didn\u2019t take a genius to know her daughter had attended this school.  As Kyle and I followed Grace, I turned to Kyle and said, \u201cWith everything that\u2019s happened, I have to say this is the weirdest thing to happen in my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit, this is pretty weird for me as well.  But.\u201d Smiling, Kyle said, \u201cThis is what Grace wanted; and we want to be supportive and loving parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat we do.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI\u2019m already used to Grace calling me Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before we\u2019d arrived at the auditorium.  While the kids went to the front, Kyle and I joined the parents in the back.  We quickly spotted Carly, formerly Carl, sitting nearby.  Walking over to sit with her, I saw that she was all dressed up; wearing a figure hugging dress and boots.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cAren\u2019t you a little overdressed for a school orientation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a date right after this with a guy on my floor.\u201d Pausing, Carly said, \u201cI figured it would save time and he could meet me here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Kevin?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cAre you bringing your former wife on a date?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d pausing, Carly said, \u201cI was actually hoping you guys could watch him for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a quick glance at Kyle, who nodded in agreement, I said, \u201cWe\u2019d love to watch him; it would give Grace a chance to deal with her feelings for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve noticed that too, huh?\u201d chuckling, Carly said, \u201cKevin\u2019s talked about nothing but Grace for the last three days; he\u2019s really hoping they\u2019re in the same class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know; I think it\u2019s funny how things turned out.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cHere I am; a teenage boy in the body of a pregnant woman, dating her boyfriend.  I\u2019m a mother to an 8 year old girl who used to be a grown man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe this is how things were meant to be.\u201d</span></div></div>",

.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat ,what are you talking about.Just tell me whose body she got<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell the question as to who we dont know yet all we know is that she is called nate cause you see her current body wasnt wearing much when she swapped in to it.from what she's told me she got shocked to finding her self all of a sudden strange place in an awkward situation so when she got the chance she just picked up a coat she found and just ran like hell ,you should have seen her when she got here ,all out of breath sweat dripping at her chocklate breasts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChocklate you mean she's black now <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep.from what i can say somewhere around my own age,oops i mean now your age<br>\r\n<br>\r\nalright,where is she now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwell after i  told her about who i am and what happened to you she just sat at the couch crying for a while .I comforted her a bit and eventually she fell asleep being tired from her shock with the swap and the things that followed before she made it here<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwait what?what are you talking about?i know my mom is  a sweet and all but she isnt the type to loose her cool like that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwell after what happened i dont blame her for being a bit shocked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it that you are not telling me cindy ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwell its going to shock you a little but i want you to keep your  cool,your pregnant remember<br>\r\n<br>\r\nall right all right ,,quite stalling and tell me whats happenend with my mom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwell evan when the shift happened your mother was busy taking a bath.she was in the shower at the time the swap happened.she  just turned off the water and was busy applieing some soap all over her body.she soaped up her legs her arms her torso and just as she was applying the soap in between her breasts it happened .One moment she was looking at her breasts being soaped up by her own hands and next she found herself with her eyes closed,she felt something in her mouth pumping in and out and her hands were on the floor and so where her legs she was on all four and she felt something pumping at her vagina as well<br>\r\nthere where spasms going ripping through all over body.she knew what was happening someone was fucking her .she jolted her eyes open to find her self looking at pubic hair and to her shock she found herself giving a blowjob while being fucked at the sametime before she could pull the dick out of her mouth it stiffened and the next thing she knew her mouth was filled with a huge load of cum.she had to swallow it all because that dick all the way inside her mouth and she couldnt spit it out.The man in front of her all of a sudden pulled his dick out of her mouth and took a few steps back she said he had a shocked look in his face thats when she noticed that the man behind her had also stopped pumping his cock in her pussy .She saw the man in front of her look at her and then at the man behind her with a shocked expression and then ran out calling for his mommy .The man behind her all of a sudden pushed her away only for her to fall on to  the floor .it wasnt much of a fall since she was already on Doggystyle.she felt her breasts get squished as she fell and thats when she felt that something was different about her .The man behind her ran after the first man towards the door as she got up.she coughed a few times spitting out as much cum as she can and thats when she looked at her arms .they had chockolate skin Her own skin was creamy white.she lookedd down to see that it was not just her arms her entire body had chocklate coloured skin and not just that the breast they were more round and perkier than her they were the same size but had dark areolas.she had dark  brown coloured nipples her own nipples were light brownish pink she also noticed that she was slimmer there was not even an ownce of fat in her belly and her hip were large she had an hourglass figure .she could feel  that there was cum dripping out of her pussy she got up and looked around to see that she was in a seedy motel room she saw a mirror  and went to stand in front of it.Looking back at her was a girl of african american descent maybe about 24,or 25 big pouty lips perky breasts brown eyes straight nose wide hips cum dripping pussy smooth toned legs and round lovely .she was standing there with her mouth wide open she looked a porn star.HELLO she tried  out her voice and a tough girl type voice ccame out of her mouth.she took a closer look to see that her pussy was shaved and there was just above her pussy a tattoo.it was a writing of some kind she couldnt make out.she turned to her side to see that there was another tattoo on her arm and wait her whole back has been tattooed something looking like a couple making out under the moonlit sky and there was a tattoo of a bull's horns just above her ass<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just stood there looking at herself dumbfounded for who knows how long before.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

the full length mirror gazing at it as though it was my first time watching my own reflection(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pinterest.com/pin/20336635787676186/\" target=\"_blank\">http://pinterest.com/pin/203366357876761...</a>).I tried blinking my eyes and the woman in the mirror did the same,She she was black or I am black now.No no no how can this be ,This this isnt me .This cant be me.I am a mother of two kids but this body it doesnt look much older than 25 and these tattooss there everywhere in my body.They do make me look hot though.Wait what am i thinking What's  Happening to me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cant be this woman.Okay remember your not this girl you were at home just finished folding the laundry and was taking your bath and the next thing you know you had some guy's cock in your mouth and another ramming you from behind.Although some part of you felt repulsed your body all of a sudden felt excited at that thought,your pussy getting wet all of a sudden.No diid this body just enjoy that thought ,did i just consider the idea  of giving a blowjob to a man while being fucked by another.No no no that's disgusting only a whore would do that I am not a whore this woman is,wait I am inside her body.I am inside a whore's body what if i cant change back what if i am stuck like this .I cant be this slut who knows how many men she's slept,who knows what she's done with this body no there has to be a way to fix this .There has to be an explanation,Wait a minute i was taking a bath and suddenly got turned in to this woman could that mean she's also<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nate you wont believe this shit ,I somehow swapped bodies with this white boy who was fucking you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were startled  awake from your thoughts by that sudden voice and turned to the side it came from to see the man who was fucking your pussy earlier and he was buck naked.No he was fucking this girl it wasnt me you corrected your thought.You quickly covered  your nipples and pussy with both your hands while desperately looking at the room for some form of clothing to cover your new naked body.No matter what this girl was you were no slut and you were definitely not entertaining the idea of some man looking at you naked,although he does have a nice dick there .Wait why did i think that.You thought as you found a shirt to cover your self in the bed and quickly put it over your naked body.you tried not looking at the naked man in front  of you although you were peaking glances and asked him in a nervous tone \"who are you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYo,Calm down girl said the man,Its me ben well i guess i was ben.I was waiting outside the door waiting for you to finish up with these guys while counting the money paid for you.1 moment i am looking at the 100 dollar bills in my hand,all of a sudden i feel dizzy and the next thing i know i am ramming at your ass  while looking at you suck off that other white boy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMOM-  You swapped bodies <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan-Hellooo that's what i been trying to tell yah,I ran out to see if my body was still there but the damn bastard whoever he was in my body took off with our cash and my body though this aint that bad either ,look at me i am white ,30years which makes me 10 years younger and not that bad looking either so whattcha think<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMOM-The fist thought that came in to your mind is what a stud i'd sure love to ride that dick of his .You were startled by that thought you never had any urges like this you pushed that thought to the back of your head and to avoid looking at him spoke\"I am sorry but i am not who you think i am and  could you please put on some clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen-What?You are not Nate ,Who the hell are you then<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom-My name's Helen ,I am a mother of two kids,I was at my home when all of a sudden i found my self in this body engaging in that disgusting act you said you kept peeping glances at the Man<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen-Wow wait so its not just me and since you are not from this neibourhood this thing this swap could be a state wide or maybe nation wide hell the whole world could be affected<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom-That's when that thought hit you he could be right .could this have affected your children as well could they have ended up in a similar situation to yours,you thought i have to get back home with that thought you turnedd around only to see that ben was still naked.You quickly turned around not before taking a nice quick look at ben all over and said  \"For godsake please just put on some clothes alright\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen-Shut your yapping bitch Ben roaded ,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trembled a bit on hearing that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen-I guess your one of those stuck up prim and proper bitches from the better part of town Huh, He said as he approched You.Just cause you got fucking loades of cash you think you are better than the rest of us dont ya<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were really starting to get scared,Not only were you buck naked in a strange woman's body but you were confronted by an angry stranger who was also naked with a raging hardon but for some reason this also excited you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen-Look i am sorry alright its i just i have to go find my kids and the thought of them frustrated me i  am sorry but i have to go you said while getting up trying to look for something to wear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen-Your not going anywhere bitch,Ben saidd as he grabbed Helen by the shoulder and pushed her back in to the bed,she was very scared now and it could be seen on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen-Incase if you havent noticed your not your fucking stuckup self anymore ,You are in nate's  body and Nate belongs to me which means i fucking own you now bitch,you are mine so say goodbye to your old life cause your days and nights are now going to be filled with sex and orgies and you are going to suck and fuck every man i bring,you got that bitch you are low life ,a whore ,a fucking bitch who opens up her cunt to anyone with enough cash,Got that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen was filled with fear at this point .She was thrown back in to the bed by the 6foot white man with bulging muscles.She used her hands to support herself to a sitting position and since her shirt wasnt buttoned up it was showing a nice view of her breasts to ben which only aroused ben's newly aquired cock even more,Helen looked to see that ben was standing by the bed directly infront of her looking at her breasts with his dick hanging infront of her face and to her shock Her eye's wear actually fixed upon the dick while occasionally glancing at ben's face.Her mouth had started to water and her pussy was getting wet and to her disgust a small thought of sucking his dick suddenly flashed through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmy god Whats happening to me?Did i just think about sucking his cock  Am i going to be a slut from now on like he said no no no ,i cant i wont she said in her mind,I cant let the filth left behind by this body's former occupent ruin me .I am Helen and i am no whore<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point ben had realised what was going on with helen,Nate's body was exerting its own desires in to her mind and she was having trouble denying it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen-What's the matter there,You like my dick.Helen gave a horrified look at ben <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen-No keep that thing away from me,I am no whore,i am not a slut,I have never misused my body ever in my life.I am not going ..to turn in to a lowlife<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen-Oh is that so<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen suddenly grabs helen by the neck and pushes her infront of the mirror ,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen-Take a good look babe.See that face of yours,Those big juicy lips ,They've sucked off more dicks in a day than you can count.see that tongue in your mouth its tasted cum and swallowed it from so many men that you can even tell the smallest differences in their taste now and take a real good look at your pussy,ever since it hit puberty its been fucked by guys of every age race and size that you can think of.I hope i made my point clear to you you are a slut now ,you body craves sex.Your libido is almost constanstly on overdrive.You are Nate now and everything she was you are going to turn into,if you fight it i am going to have to punish you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this he throws her back into the bed.she lands into the bed wimpering and she realised that he was planning on fucking her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen-Please no dont,dont do this to me.Please i have kids <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen- Really,from what i know nate doesnt have any kids then again what guarantee do you have that your kids are still kids<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen-Please dont,i am begging you dont do this to me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen-Cmon how do you know you wont like it unless you try it and i just got this big whooper .I am just dying to use this thing .Dont worry babe you'll love it.I am not the same greasy fat guy whom you used to fuck to stay on my good side right now i am a fucking greek god and i am going to show you what my lightning rod can do<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this ben approached helen.He grabbed hold of helen's head with one hand and strokking his dick with the other<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts right in front of helen's face and although she is trying to resist it her body is betraying her .She can feel her mouth starting to water up and her pussy is so wet its starting to dampen the sheets<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen-No No oh god please dont let this happen to me she prayed though it is  a waste to let such a big piece of rod to go to waste.The last thought completely caught her offguard.she didnt know where it had come from.she started to feel her self break apart as ben moves his dick closer as he pushes your head towards it.Your waging a war both mentally and physically here and you are loosing both .His dick is now mere centimeters away from your mouth and he tells you to open your mouth .You take  a look upto his eyes with tears flowing out of your own and look back at the dick.Your body wants it but you dont .You cant do this but this body wants it .I i i i cant but i have to i cant give int o these urges .Oh my god he wasnt kidding these urges are strong <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all that going around you you finally<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had to adapt quickly to your new centre of gravity,  the tightness of your new female uniform and especially the skirt you are wearing. Every step triggered a new sensation, you could feel your clothes shifting around your body, your hips swaying and your new breasts moving under your shirt. It felt as if your clothes were about to burst. You wondered if it was the previous owner of this body who liked her clothes tight or if it was just the dress code of this tacky restaurant , cause it definently brought in customers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally found the locker room. Finding Samantha's locker was easy , her name is written big on hers. You walked in front of it and just realized you didn't know the combination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you see a full body length mirror on the wall. Let's see what I'm working with , you say and make your way towards it. Damn this chick is packing. No wonder I felt a bit of a spring in my step, look at those legs. Her physique is top notch, I can see how fit she is straight through the uniform. These huge boobs are a bonus , you say as you gave it a squeeze. You unbutton her shirt, revealing a sports bra and wash board abs. You drop her skirt , revealing that succulent legs with thigh high stockings stretching over it. The stockings is almost at tearing point and is being held in place with a garter belt. The panties is matching with a lace trim. The reflection is turning you on.<br>\r\nThe noise of the customers snaps you back to reality. Maybe I must go find the manager or maybe I must do a bit more exploring you ponder </span></div></div>",

A weight was tugging at my chest, a weight was tugging on my head, my clothes felt incredibly tight and when I looked down I got the shock of my life. Two sizeable breast were pushing out from a lacy white top, with a tight black skirt encasing a pair of legs that would have been at home on the pages of any magazine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d said someone behind the lights, \u201cYou stole my body!\u201d said someone else, \u201cOh my God, am I losing my mind?

This confused me, as I always kept my hair cut short. Tony Colleta, the guy whose guts I hated so much, thought long hair on a guy meant they were gay. Tony Colleta hated gays (a typical high school homophobe). Besides, it kept my hair out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I was understandably shocked when I looked down and saw a conservative dark blue pleated skirt and a white blouse. Plus, of course, two considerable mounds where my chest used to be. I almost passed right back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, I looked at my surroundings. I was in a rather plain classroom filled with the everyday cheap tan desks, one thick but bright window in one corner, and Christ in His Agony on the wall, above the blackboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, I was more focused on the people in the room. I found a lot of confused students, with all the girls dressed like me, and boys in dress pants and a white polo. Also, there was a rather imposing ancient nun striding about the room in an attempt to restore order. I nearly laughed out loud at how dead on the Hollywood stereotype of a Woman of God was. Shock is a funny thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nun realized something had to be wrong on the outside of school to cause this sort of pandemonium. She reached under her desk, and like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, came a FEMA radio. This time I really did laugh. Every staion had a taped \"in case of emergency\" broadcast. The Lady was suddenly speaking of Armaggedon and Second Coming to the students (several of whom had already fled), which only increased the panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There wasn't even a paper with a name on it in her pocket. Finally, I looked at a small, golden cross around my neck (It was, admittedly, still sort of nice to look down, even if I didn't like having the breasts myself) and found the name ANNA stenciled on the back. Well, at least I had a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class and the ancient nun were'nt getting anywhere fast. Man, it was loud in that classroom! I just had to leave, or I might just go crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I had thought things were crazy in the classroom, it was nothing as compared to the hallways. The hallways looked just like a classroom, just without desks and made longer. Oh, and no windows, either. All there was for light were some bright, utilitarian flourescents, throwing an unforgiving light. Some people were sprinting back and forth looking for god-knows-what, others calling out for friends, some just crying. It was a madhouse.  I was just contemplating re-entering the classroom and waiting for all the racket to die down when I was grabbed from behind on my upper arm. Hard, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wheeled around to find a rather short, pleasant looking blonde girl staring at me. She immediatley began talking to me, obviously sure that I was who I looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna!\" she nearly yelled, \"something horrible has happened!\" Before I could interrupt, she continued. \"I was just in Hill's Social Studies and this-\" she gestured at the crazed people in the hallway- \"just started out of the blue!\" I noted her deep South accent. \"Do you think we'll be able to find Mellissa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt rather guilty watching her cute, hopeful face fall after I asked, \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really don't know me? I'm your best friend!\" she just about whispered, crestfallen, as she withdrew her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll suppose I'll go first. Up until about five minutes ago, I was Evan, a seventeen year-old guy. But I guess I'll go by Anna, too now. I think a lot of the people in these halls, hell, maybe everywhere, is in a similar situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she stared at me like I was crazy, but it dawned on her slowly that yes, this was plausible. At the very least, more plausible than most therories. It fit with the clues, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery cautiously, she introduced herself as Katherine, Anna's best friend for eight years. And of course, a good friend of Mellissa's. Even though Katherine kept a very close eye on me, we agreed we should probably stay together, because it made no sense to split up. Anyways, two heads are better than one when looking for one girl who could literally be anyone in a fairly large school like this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had favored leaving the school, but Katherine had warned about leaving the school to go into Atlanta.

She must of had the purse in a locker before class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was of Katherine and two other girls that I did not recognize. She pointed at the black girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the picture, I saw that Katherine and Mellissa were nearly exact opposites. Katherine was a very white, short girl with a narrow nose, green eyes, and short, shoulder-cropped blonde hair. Mellissa, on the other hand, was a rather tall girl of African descent, with coffee colored skin, dark eyes, a wide nose, and neat black hair pulled back into a pony tail. The only thing they seemed to have in common is that they were both good-looking. I didn't know who the middle girl was, but she was beautiful, even though she couldn't have been more than fourteen, like the other two. Long, middle of the back, light brown hair, a pretty, innocent face, and some generous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI asked Katherine what Mel's 3rd period class was. She was certain that it was an Algebra class, but that was clear across the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get going then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene was pretty much the same everywhere. Students, all dressed alike, even teachers, nuns, and a priest were either crying, running, shouting, or looking at themselves. A few were just walking, like me and Katherine, but we were in the minority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my mind, we had no chance of finding this girl unless she came to us. Katherine was either unaware of this or did not want to believe it, but Mellissa may still be near her body. I had nothing else to do anyways. Its not like I had a lot of contacts in Georgia to find! I was sort of starting to like Katherine anyways, despite our initial meeting. I still think she thought that I was crazy, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had to go through the cafeteria to reach the Math hall, but it was literally packed. People must have decided that the biggest room was the safest, or had a better chance of containing friend. Either way, it wasn't easy getting through. When we finally found an empty space, I needed a rest. However, Katherine was determined to keep moving. I asked for the picture, desperate for any excuse. My eyes immediately flicked to the middle girl. She was HOT! My eyes drifted south, and right where the chest began curving, was a spot of gold standing out against the white. I pulled the photo closer. It was a small, golden cross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn't be! I felt like I needed to find a mirror or something, but Katherine was already moving. I couldn't just leave the only person I knew in the state to look at myself in the mirror!</span></div></div>",

I wouldn't accomplish anything alone. Besides, I'm sure I would get to see it all before too long, whether I wanted to or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I knew it, we had walked made it across the panicked, crowded school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's this room. At least, I'm pretty sure.\" I had no choice but to follow her into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked exactly like the room I had come out of, excepting the window. This classroom was, by my estimation, one room from the outer wall. There were only three students in the room, including the girl I recognized as Mellissa from the photograph. She was just sitting in a desk near the front with a listless expression. She glanced up at us when we walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel? is that you?\" Katherine asked, having learned her lesson from her and I's first meeting. She sadly shook her head. \"So who are you?\" Katherine continued in a gentle voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like was. Was Austin Jones.\" I heard Katherine draw a quick gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the basketball team?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know much of what was going on between these two, but I could sympathize with the guy (girl?). Just fifteen minutes ago, I was in the same position. Probably still would be if Katherine hadn't found me first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we turned for the door, Mellissa/Austin Jones shouted \"Wait!\" As we turned back to face her, she began to plead with us. \"Please, can I come with you? I mean, I won't be any trouble. It's just that, well, I have nowhere else to go. I'll even help you find your friend. Especially if she's in my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really didn't care if he came, I mean, I was in the same situation not long ago. But Katherine was enthusiastically on board with the idea. \"Sure! Come with. Please, the more, the merrier!\" I was begining to suspect Katherine had a little bit of a crush on Austin Jones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMellissa got to her feet unsteadily. \"So where to now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine didn't know. \" The cafeteria's a nightmare right now, but maybe that's where she is. Where was your class when you switched?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gym.\" They turned to me for the answer. I don't know, I've been in this school for just fifteen minutes! Oh well, someone has to make a decision. </span></div></div>",

As you went up a flight of stairs, you noticed that you were beginning to think like a girl; thinking about how the skirt showed off your legs.  You thought about mentioning that to Katherine and Melissa, but decided against it.  After another few minutes of searching, you came across an abandoned faculty office.  As Melissa/Austin and Katherine had gone ahead of you, you yell out, \"Guys!! I found a place to hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa/Austin and Katherine run back to you.  Peaking inside, Katherine says, \"This should do fine,\" pointing to a fridge in the corner, she says, \"We'll have food and water until we can go find Melissa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear some footsteps, and screaming, coming your way, so you say, \"Lets get inside and block the door!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you go inside, and find a desk that was heavy enough to keep the door closed.

Getting uncomfortable, you say, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie, looking at you, says, \"Evan, you're the furthest from home.  You should call your family first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing Katie was right, you get up and say, \"Okay.  Where's the phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you.\"  Katie leads you to where the phone was, and then left you to talk in private.  Dialing your number, you wonder if your parents 'shifted.'  Your question was answered, a few seconds later, when a guy answered the phone.  \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure who you were talking to, you say, \"Whose this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl responds, \"I'm Cathy Stentson.  Whose this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, you say, \"Mom!!  Its me, Evan!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan!!  Oh my god!  Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine mom, aside from being in a girl's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that.  I'm in Kirk Johnson's body, and your father is in Kelly Anderson's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked to hear that.  Kirk was your next door neighbor, 23 years old, and Kelly was his girlfriend.  \"How is everyone else?  Are Ryan and John there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I talk to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry sweetie, but they're in no condition to talk right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John is freaking out about being a pregnant girl, and Ryan is trying to calm him down.  I'll let them know you called though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I talk to Corinne?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.  She's standing right next to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second, the voice of Jake Watson comes on the phone.  \"Evan? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Cori.  It's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in the body of a 14 year old girl in Atlanta, but I'm otherwise fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Corinne talking to someone on the other end.  After a second, she comes back on the line.  \"Evan.  Anna wants to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna takes the phone and says, \"Evan, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  We're all at Katie's house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you guys find Mel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's fine.  She's still getting used to being a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's everyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told Anna how everyone else was doing.  She thought it was pretty funny that Katie's dad was a 13 year old girl.  \"Aaron, the guy in Katie's mom's body, is starting to act alot like Katie's mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know what he's going through.  I'm starting to get aroused by your friend Ryan...he make's a cute girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you talked to your parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  They're glad that I'm safe; your parents assured them that they'd protect me until we can come home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie said they might not like that a boy is in your body.  How did they take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were worried, at first, that you'd try to defile my body.  After I assured them that wouldn't happen, they said that they wanted to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  I'll call them once everyone else talks to their families.\" pausing, you say, \"Did they get 'shifted'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  They actually shifted into each other's bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you talk for a few more minutes, before you say, \"I got to go Anna.  I think I hear Katie's dad's body coming in the front door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  Stay safe Evan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You to Anna.\" pausing, you say, \"Sorry we had to meet like this.\"</span></div></div>",

I mean I am a girl now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right.\" opening the door, Aaron says, \"Let's not keep him waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walk into the family room and you see Tina sitting on the couch.

Anyway I looked at the mirror and I saw a Woman that was about 5\u20197, she had some curves on her hips and Her hair was a brunette color that went past down her shoulders. Her face looked cute kinda like one of those girls that lived next door to you. I said to myself\u201d so this is me now.\u201d I was kinda scared and worried because I did not know what happens with my friends or my family and I hoped they were okay. I looked at my breast and what they looked like were pretty big at my chest. I was not an expert at  breast size becuase I never really cared about that. The only I know that is A cups is small and G cup is big. My breast looked kinda big but not small. I walked to one of Linda\u2019s drawers and open one that had the bras in them. I learned that her breast size was a small D cup size . I said\u201d Jezz her breast are big!\u201d I could not get over the British accent. It felt very strange to hear and at the same time very rexlaing. Cupping my breast  they felt very sensitive, they felt like another park of skin on my body.

My mom said to me\" Evan I am going to the store to get some food for tonight.\" I said to my mom\" ok mom, do you need any help?\" she said no and I replied \" I love you, I will see you later. I hug her and she left.\"  Then all of a sudden, I felt this sharp pain that was on my chest. It felt like my body was on fire, So I ran upstairs and into the bathroom and I notices the changes happing to my body. I was suddenly loseing a couple of inches in height and my face was Turing back into Linda's face. My chest started to grow and I notices the boobs growing on My chest. I also notice my hair color change from a light brown color to a more darker brownish color. I said to myself\" Please!!, No don't let this happen to me\" I screamed at the mirror, I knew even screaming at the mirror would not stop anything. So after the changes had stop, I just cried in front of the mirror and beg that all of this was just a bad dream and I would go back to being my old self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI Gasph   from waken up form my dream.I felt like it was a terrible nightmare that I just expeirned. Their was alot of sweet that was on my body. It was like coming back from a long practice or something like that.  I looked at my hands and notcie I was back again in Linda body, I knew their  was no way I can ever return back to my old self or the life I had before.I looked at my hands, the skin on my hands told me how much time has passed on her. Her hands seemed to have some wrinkles on them and  their was a wedding ring on my right finger. I thought to myself\" So she was married before all of this happen\" I sighed. I felt gulity for stealing someones life and sad that I have lost some many years of my life as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I going back to sleep was not a option. I decided to watch some tv to help me clam down from my situation. I notice the only channels were on were the News Channel manily BBC. I wanted to learn what was happing around the world. The  BBC new reporters said that 93 percent of the human pouplation has changed, many of the poltican have also changed as well. So while the polticans are out of power, The world is in chaos and their are alot of protest form the shifted people to ask the government what is going on and to help them.  Suddenly the reporter said\" this just in, Their was a  Public speech from the British prime minister. Here is a speech.\" I  felt like their was some hope and that maybe the prime minister  might bring back some hope to me. I notice that the Prime minster  was in a Woman body, probably his wife  any way he said\" citizens   of the Uk, I know that this has been a strange day and that I know many of you are scared. scared of what the future of whats going to happen. I know that we are all afraid that we might lose are jobs, are lives, and are families.  However it my responsibly to not let this happen. Their will be Government funding that will help Uk citizens or any one that has been affected by this \"great shift\" To help them get their job back,  their lives back and their families back. Also their will be a national requirement where all citizens will need to register their originally name and their Identities and what ever bodies they are in.  Thank you and may God bless you. The speech than went on repeat as this was Good news. So I turned of the tv, deciding that I did not want to hear the same message another 50 times.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the mirror again. This was probably thousand more times I would be looking at the mirror, It was very strange and I felt like I would never get use to this. I said to myself\" Linda, You kind look like a MILF.\" This was true, her body looked pretty good and Her whole body seem like should look like a Milf to a 15 year old The Hands, her hips, Her butt, Her boobs and her hair . To me she looked hot and I felt like I was proud of that. Still I  wanted to know if My family was safe and my friends were ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I Hear a knock on the door. i headed to the door to find that it was </span></div></div>",

I said\" Hi come in.\" I asked her \" where did you go?\"  Haley said\" I went to my house to see if anyone stole anything or rob my house. Anyway its all find some I wanted to check on you to see if you are ok.\" I said\" I am alright, but thanks for checking on me.\"  \"So anyway where am I?\" I asked. i never  really thought about it. All  I knew was that I was far from Home and that I had a British accent.  She said\" Well first off you are in England and we are in London city, However we are in the outside of the city about  1 hour away form Big Ben.I used Big Ben because you probably now what is Big Ben.\"  \"OK, Do you know anything about this person body  I asked?' Gesturing to myself. Haley laughed and said\" You Americans always love asking questions.\" I chuckled agreeing since this was always a thing running in the family.\" She continued \" You  are Leslie Sheffield, a 39 year old British women that works at a local bar with me. Leslie was married before the shift but that had some issues so they decided to divorce. Her Husband took both of your kids because you did not have enough money to take both of them. I said \" Thats pretty sad.\" I felt very sorry for her losing  her children must be the worst things a mom must experience. Haley agrre and said\" yeah it was a pretty hard time for her, she was about to kill herself but I  was friend from high school and we went to school together in college so I stepped in and helped her. It was getting better for her, than the shift happend and now I am with you.\"  One last fact she said\" She never liked the name Lesile, so She nicknamed herself Linda.\"   \" Thats a very interesting background, Helps me understand of who the person I have become\" This was some interesting news about the history of this person.  Haley asked\" You never really told me about your self. How about you tell about your self since I told you some facts about me and Lesile\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told her about my Whole history. I explained to her that I turned 15  a couple months ago. My family grew up in Michigan, My Mom and Dad got divorce when I was a baby so I never really knew about anything about my Dad. My Mom had to both supports us from Home and in  work. She was a good women both in the heart and when She was working. She was always very motivational and helped me stay positive when ever I felt sad. I also told Haley, that I had a sister name Corrine and while she may be annoying at times she was a good sister to have. Haley jokingly said\" So  means you are the older sister now right?\" I said to her\" yes it does takley make me the older sister now, but a very old sister now.\"  I thought to myself \" hopefully they are ok, and they are safe.\"  Haley asked me \"Did you hear about the news?\"  Yes, I actually did hear about the news and hopefully I can go the US embassy to let them know about my situation.  The  public transportation is down but I  have a car we can take to head to the city.  \"Ok than lets go\" I said. Hold on before we go you need to change your cloths. We headed upstairs to Lesile room and we opend up her drawers to find that she  had some many cloths to wear. Their was some many options to chose. I looked at Haley and said\" Shouldn't you not be in here while I change?\" She look at me half serious and said\" Really?\"  ok than help me change than. I  decided to wear.</span></div></div>",

Haley told me\" since you have large breast now, If you ever need to run put on a sports bra, This will help you when you are running and that your boobs wont jiggle when you are running' She handed me a sports bra and I  told her thank, Having no idea how to put one on  Haley had to help me put the bra on, I told her \"No wonder why women have a hard time putting on bras?'  Haley said\" Yeah dont worry,  that why it takes us a longer time when a women has larger breast.  I put on yoga pants, a t-shirt and a sweatshirt. Haley  looked at me saying \" thats what you want to go in.\" \"Yeah it fells comfortable and it makes me fell atleast I was back in my old body.\" This was the only way I can fell casual about myself.  We left the house,  I made sure to grab her purse, and her phone and I locked the door of the house after we left. We Got into  Haley car and headed into the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile on the way to the city. I looked around, the road was filled with many cars on the road, People screaming, crying or fighting each other. It felt like total chaos, It was ike being in a warzone. Haley said\"  Everyones just scared, I am almost fell bad for these people what they are experience.\"  I aggred, as we contuine on the freeway, I notice w women crying for his mother and kid calling for his daughter.  Haley asked me where we are going again. I told her I need to head to the Us Embassy to let them know about what is going on. I also hoped that the they can give me any advice on what to do.  For the reminder of the time it was sileint, to no longer keep the awkward silence any longer, I turned on the music to listen to keep my self clam. Also the rest of the time was me just poking at my boobs or looking at  myself.  Haley keeping her eyes on the road said\" Really, you have to do that while I am in the car.\" I said \" sorry, Any 15 year old boy would be doing this if they go them selves in side a women body.  She continued,\" just do that when you get home. Please?\"  \"Ok.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving into the city, It was still chaotic and their was panic all over the place.  I asked, \" Maybe when this is all over, can you give me a tour of London?\"  She said\" Sure why not, technically you are a tourist and I would love giving a tour of city with you.\" I smiled, Even though we never met each other it seemd like our friendship was slowly building up to a good relationship. Haley also said\" Also when this is all over hopefully your family might vist and than I can give a tour of the city with them as-well.\" I agreed, That would be a awesome Idea.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Day 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole world went black for a moment. When I could see again, I could tell I wasn't in Mr. Tomlin's class listening to a lecture on angles. For starters, I was laying on a bed with what felt like silk sheets. I got out and almost fell on my face trying to stumble around to find a light switch. When I finally found one and turned the lights on and found a mirror, I was completely shocked. I saw maybe the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. She had blond hair that came down to her shoulders and was tall with long legs. She had some muscles to suggest she played some sort of sport.  She wasn't the tannest of girls, but she wasn't pale either. I quickly looked outside, and saw it was dark outside. Then I noticed an alarm clock. It said it was the 12:03 am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird\" I whispered. I was surprised by the sound of my new higher feminine voice. I looked around the room. It was a plain white room. There were a few pictures, all of which had my new body in them. When I looked at the pictures, I noticed some famous buildings from Sydney, Australia. I continued looking around and found what looked like a drivers license. It had my new body's picture on it and it said her name was Elsa Johansson. Right next to it was what looked like a school ID. It said she was in the same grade as I was and she was an exchange student from Sweden. From the looks of things, she was spending the school year in Australia. I yawned. \"Weird, I wasn't tired before this happened. \"Maybe it's just this girls body is tired\" I tiredly said. I quickly turned the lights off and hoped into the bed. Within seconds of my head hitting the pillows, I was out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning I woke up to the sounds of girls screening. Havering forgotten about last night I jump out of bed and am scared by my chest jiggling. Grabbing my new chest, I suddenly remember everything about last night. I run out of my new room to two girls, one who was about 10 with short brown hair and the other who was about 15 with brown hair that went just past her shoulder blades, fighting and saying how they wanted their body back. Pulling them apart, I ask \"What is going on here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Elsa, Emily stole my body last night and she doesn't want to give it back\" the younger girl said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you Chloe, I didn't do this\" the older girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, it is possible that this is neither of you did this. You see, yesterday I was I guy named Evan. I was in my math class back home in Michigan when I blacked out. When I came to, it was midnight and I still don't think I know where I am\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, so nobody here did this? Wait a minute, you said Michigan. As in the States\" the younger girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Ok, well my name is Chloe. I used to be 15 years old. That is my sister Emily. She was 10. And now we are in each others bodies.\" Chloe said (was 15 years old but is now 10).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, nice to meet both of you. Now who's body am I in\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are in Elsa Johansson's body. She was a Swedish exchange student who came here for the extra credits she would get for when she went back to school in Sweden\" Chloe answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Now, where are we\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are in Sydney Australia\" Emily answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are your parents\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are mom died two years after giving  birth to Emily. Our dad is away on business\" Chloe answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before this year, the family next door would have their eldest daughter babysit us while he was gone. He didn't want us home alone, we fight sometimes. But this year, he would just put Elsa in charge until he comes home\" Emily added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the phone rang. \"I'll answer it\" I told the girls. \"If its your father, I'll tell him we are fine here, but I'm not Elsa\". I picked up the phone. \"Hello\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elsa, oh thank god, I was worried when I saw on the news the there was mass body swapping over night. Are you alright?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Chloe and Emily switched bodies. But I'm not Elsa\" I stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well who are you?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up until last night, I was I guy in the state of Michigan by the name of Evan\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michigan? As in the United States of America?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then. Tell the girls I will call again when I am able to get home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do sir\" I assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he say\" they asked in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he said he would be home as soon as possible, but he didn't say anything about being swapped. I don't know if he swapped, but I assume he didn't.\" I answered them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets turn the TV on. Maybe we will find out if this is permeant or not\" Chloe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's as good an idea as any\" I added. \"Let's get dressed first\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both agreed with me. But before Chloe left to her sisters room, I stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hay Chloe, would you mind helping me get dressed. It is after all my first day as a girl\" I quietly asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, sure, no problem\" she replied. She took my hand and lead me to Elsa's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait here\"  she said, so I sat on the bed. Moments later she came out of the walk-in closet with clothes in hand. I couldn't quite see what they were, but it wasn't a large pile. She then went to the dresser and opened the top shelf. She pulled something out, closed it, opened the one below it, pulled something out, and then came over and handed me the clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you are ok with these, I tried to find something conferrable.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" I told her. With that, she left. I looked at what she had gotten me for Elsa's closet and dresser. On top there was some basic white cotton panties, with a light blue sports bra next to it. I quickly took of my pajamas and put the underwear and bra on with no trouble. \"I bet these were in the dresser\" I thought. Then I looked at what she got from the closet. She had picked out a pair of black spandex pants and a tight red teeshirt. I put them on and walked out of the room. Realizing it was about ten minutes after nine, I decided to look for the kitchen so I could have some breakfast. I got their just after Emily. She was wearing her sisters short plain black running shorts and a plain grey teeshirt. She was eating a bowl of Captain Crunch when I came in. Without saying a word she hands me a bowl. We ate in silence until Chloe came in about fifteen minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just watching the news and there are scientist's all over the world saying that while they don't know how or why this happened, but they think for now it's permeant. They will try and find a cause, and maybe that will lead to a cure, but for now it seems we're all stuck in these bodies\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they saying about school\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is closed for this week. After that, it will be week by week. They want to give every scientist as much as possible before everyone tries to return to a somewhat normal life\" she answered. \"Then you go to the classes you were originally going to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me\" I asked. \"Did they say when air travel would be running again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sorry\" Chloe replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the stores? If I'm stuck here in this body, I don't think I can dress like this\" I asked gesturing to my clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They didn't say. I assume they will be open around the time the schools start back up\" she replied. \"If you want, you can look through my old clothes for some things. I was about the same size as Elsa. Although she may have been a little taller\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what she has first. Then I might just do that\" I said. With that, I finished my breakfast and left to my new room. The first thing I decided to do was check out my new clothing. What I found in my new walk-in closet was incredible. On the first wall (walking in, right side) was from what I could tell, all of her shirts. There were pinks, purples, yellows and bright greens. There were also a few reds and blues. And it was all color coordinated from brightest of a color to darkest, and the colors were all from what I could tell alphabetized. She had lots of tight looking shirts, but some looked a little looser. On the other wall (walking in, left side) she had all her shorts and pants. She had lots of short running shorts, some yoga pants, and a few skirts. On the far wall, she had all her sweatshirts, dresses, and shoes. She had about thirty sweatshirts, and maybe the same amount of dresses. They were organized the same way as the shirts. Then there were the shoes. She had maybe thirty five pairs, ranging from flip flops to what I could only assume was 5 inch heels. She had maybe fifteen pairs of heels from what I would say had 1 to 5 inch heels. She had ten pairs of flip flops, and the rest were running shoes. All of her shoes were your topical girl colors. \"I think I can live with these clothes\" I thought to myself. With that, I closed the closet and headed to the livening room and watched a movie with Chloe and Emily. It was some Australian chick flick I really had no interest in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went by uneventfully. We just watched the news reports, but there was nothing new all day long. We all hoped that there would be something new, maybe what caused this. But no, there was nothing. At around ten at night, we all went to bed. I went to Elsa's room and found it hard to sleep being in a different body and all. Eventually, I fell asleep. I don't know when, but I think it was close to eleven.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I looked around in the other drawers and found some white compression shorts. Figuring these would be more conferrable than panties, I put them on. Then I went into the closet and decided that I would were a yellow short sleeve teeshirt and some short green running shorts. I left Elsa's room and had some breakfast with Chloe and Emily. When we finished we went and watched a movie that was on tv and we watched the news on commercials. It was some Australian chick flick that I didn't pay attention to that well. When the movie was over Emily said \"Evan come with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why\" I asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, while you were in the bathroom Chloe and I decided that in the off chance we are suck like this, you need to learn how to walk in heels\" she told me. What I hadn't noticed was Chloe sneak away and grab some heels from the closet. One pair was pink with a 1 inch heel. Another pair was black with a 3 inch heel. The last pair she had was purple with a 5 inch heel. I looked at her, shocked at what they wanted me to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way your going to get me to wear any of that\" I Told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry, we just figured that if this is permeant, you would learn everything eventually\" Chloe said. \"We just thought we would help you learn it slowly until everything is all somewhat back to normal and you have to leave. We figured this would be the easiest to start with. But if you want we can start with makeup\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way in hell. There is no way I will start to consider makeup\" I stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then lets get started\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, we went outside and spent all of twenty five minutes with walking in heels. We started with the 1 inch heels. They felt weird at first, like I was walking down a small hill. All in all, they weren't as hard as I thought. We practiced in those for maybe eight minutes. Then it was on to the 3 inch heels. Sense they were taller, I felt a little taller as well. I could see why shorter girls would have these, but my new body was at least six feet tall. I started off not doing so well, but I think my new bodies muscle memory kicked in and five minutes later, I was walking like a pro. Lastly, there was the 5 inch heels. \"Don't worry, if it's anything like the last two pairs, you should be fine\" Chloe said. \"It seams that you have her muscle memory which will make this easier\". She was right. We spent maybe seven minutes with the 5 inch heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we were done and went inside, I decided I needed to get out of the house for a little. I figured I would take a run. From the looks of it, my new body was in great shape. I went  into the closet to find some running shoes. I found a pair of black and white Nike's. Slipping them on and quickly tying them up I went to find Chloe to see if she could do something to keep my hair out of my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I found her, I told her what I was going to do and if she could help with my hair. She was more than willing to help. She went to my room to get one of Elsa's (I guess now there mine) hair ties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go sit In front of the couch\" she told me. I did as I was told. \"Now, I'm going to put your hair into a ponytail\" she told me how to do it then she had me do it myself. It took me a few tries, but I finally got it. I told her I would be back soon and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran for maybe half an hour. The house was in a good sized subdivision just outside Sydney. The streets were in blocks that were about ten houses by ten houses. And they all had fairly large yards to so the block was pretty big. I only did one lap around before I was done. When I got back I released that I will have to take a shower because I'm all hot and sweaty now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I took my clothes off in the bathroom i tried to pay just enough attention to my new body to get to know it. I looked at my new long legs, and my new hourglass figure. But I was most fascinated by my breasts. They were big enough to attract guys, but not so big that they would be a problem with sports. In fact, I hardly noticed them while I was running. I'm not sure if it was the sports bra or I was just not thinking about them, but they never crossed my mind. Anyway, I showered as quickly as possible. I first rinsed off in the water, then washed my body then my hair. Once I finished and dried off, put on a fuzzy purple robe and went into Elsa's room to get some clothes. I picked a clean purple sports bra and black compression shorts. Then I found a pair of black Nike running shorts and a white Nike shirt. \"Elsa had a lot of Nike workout stuff\" I said to myself. \"Makes sense if she was an athlete\". I left Elsa's room (I should start calling it my room for now) and found Chloe coming towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hay Evan, Emily and I are going down stairs to watch some movies. You want to watch some \" Chloe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of movies were you thinking about\" I asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what kind do you like\" she replied. \"Well, we have lots of different kinds. We have comedies, action, romance, animation, crime, and a few American westerns\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets go see\" I answered her. We went down stairs and she gave me a little tourer of the house. From the street, this house looked like a one story house. But what I found out was that the ground floor was like the top floor. The house had 3 more levels underground. The first underground floor had the master bedroom, a master bathroom, a small kitchen with a small fridge and microwave. The second underground floor had a home movie theater. There were two rooms. The theater room with a couch that was currently pulled out into a bed, and six recliner chairs and a huge screen to play movies on. The other room was the projection room. It had a projector hooked up to a DVD/Blur-ray player. The third and final underground floor was just a basement. It wasn't that greatly lit, and kind of damp. It had stuff like old chairs, fold out tables, an old futon. It was the smallest area in the house. We then went up to the theater floor and into the projection room there was a stack of movies that covered the whole back wall. Most of them I didn't even recognize. Then something captured my attention. That had all the marvel movies. They had Iron Man 1, 2, and 3, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, and the Avengers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the Marvel movies\" I suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" she said happily. \"Emily and I love those movies. They have lots of cute actors. But Thor is the not cute, he's super hot\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that\" I said. \"I like them for the actual story\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense, sense you were a boy a few days ago\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent the rest of the day watching movies. When we got hungry, we would go find something to eat. Around noon I made some mac n cheese. The only movie we saw with any action was Thor. I was beginning to think it was only because they thought Chris Hemsworth was hot. The rest of the day it was chick flicks. I hate to admit it but at the end of the day, there was two or three movies I could say I liked. We went to bed somewhere around eleven at night. Like last night, I had a hard time falling asleep, but I didn't lay in bed twisting and turning as long as last night. And once I was out, I was out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Day 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning I woke up around nine and put on another sports bra and compression shorts. Then I found some navy blue shorts and a plan gray teeshirt. It appeared I was the first one up so I got myself some breakfast and ate in silence. I finished shortly before Emily and Chloe came out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Emily and I decided we need to go and get some food so were going to the mall\" she told me. \"And we need you to come with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know\" Emily started. \"We could get you something to remind you of home. Like a neckless or a bracelet. You know, something you could have with you every day\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus sense I'm the only other person with driving experience, and I can't reach the peddles any more, we kind of need you\" Chloe added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll go. Where we going\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called the West Side Mall. It's only a five minute drive\" Chloe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, give me a minute\" I told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to where I had found Elsa's drivers license which I saw a few nights ago and grabbed it. I figured that in the off chance that there were any cops out, it's best if I have it so I don't get into a ton of trouble for driving with out a license. I figured I could pretend to be Elsa if that happened. Then something captured my attention. It was something in Elsa's closet. Nothing moved, it was just a pair of shoes I hadn't noticed before. It was a pair of those slip on boat shoes that every other girl at my school seamed to have. There was nothing special about them, they just didn't seem like they belonged. Everything else seemed to have something that screamed girly. Even the running shoes. But these, these didn't seam like any of Elsa's other shoes. They were just a simple light tan color. I decided to try them on. I figured if I was stuck as a girl, I might as well have my own style. I decided to put the shoes on and found they were a perfect fit (why they would not, I don't know). I decided that I would where these for our trip to the mall. We got in the car in the driveway and left for the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying something new\" Chloe asked as she sat in the seat next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not\" I answered her. \"Why, did you think I would hate everything that was Elsa's\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's just those were some of her favorite shoes. She would wear them almost everywhere\" Chloe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrived a short time later and walked around with no real plan on where we would go first. All the stores were open, and yet there was nobody anywhere. From what Chloe said, almost every store here was opened for twenty four hours. We found one of those booths that sold some dog tags. There was all sorts of designs. I found one that had an American flag and one with a Swedish flag. I took the one with the Swedish flag off its chain and out it with the American flag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you find Evan\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some dog tags with the Swedish and American flags. I figured the American flag is who I was before this happened. The Swedish flag is who I became after\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put the neckless on and decided that I would never take it off. We continued to walk around, looking into empty stores. One of of the few we went into was a clothing store. There was lots of stuff, but at first I tried to stick to gender neutral stuff. However there want much so I just started to wander. I wandered right to a section that was full of stuff for female athletes. Chloe and Emily quickly found me and helped my find something. I was grateful for there help. I found the first thing I liked. It was a short sleeve Nike sweatshirt that had a hood and zipped up the front. It had horizontal stripes that slowly faded from a dark gray and black to a light gray and white. A few seconds later, Chloe handed me another sweatshirt. This one was a pull over and was black with the Nike logo on the front. Unlike the last one, this one had no hood. Then Emily handed me a Nike tank top. It was Nike as well and was white for the most part, except for the bright neon yellow straps. I looked at her and was about to say no way in hell when she spoke up saying \"This has a built in bra. This way you can work out and not worry about a sports bra\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thinking sis\" Chloe chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey seemed happy to be shopping so I didn't say anything. Then they handed me a bright pink tank top. Unlike the last one I would need a bra with this one, but I still didn't say anything. The last thing they handed me was a Nike dress. It was bright neon yellow and white. This is were I had to put a stop to things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. That is were I draw the line\" I told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why\" Chloe asked. \"You will have wear one eventually, why not have it be one you picked out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't pick that\" I informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's just, it looks so good on you\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't even have to wear it until you feel your ready for it\" Chloe added. \"We won't pressure you into wearing it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We Promise\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeance there was nobody at the checkouts, we put my new clothes in a bag and left to finally get some groceries. When we finally left, we passed a clock and I noticed it was almost seven o'clock pm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How have we been here almost all day\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When your shopping it's not that hard\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll learn the longer that your a girl. It's like it's part of our DNA\" Chloe added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe left the mall with the trunk filled. We had mostly food, but there was some clothes. After the short drive back to the house, we unpacked the car and put everything where it belonged. I took the clothes up to my room and put them in the closet according to Elsa's system. I left my room and turned the news on to see if there was anything new happening. That is when I got some good news. The tv's were saying that the embassies would be opening tomorrow for the people like me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could be my way home\" I said. \"Tomorrow morning I'm going to see when I can get home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, we'll stay here and wait\" Chloe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night went by uneventfully. We had some chicken and went to bed around nine o'clock. I still wasn't used to being a girl, especially when it came to sleeping. But I was very slowly adjusting. I mean, I already learned I can't sleep on my chest anymore.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Day 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up before anyone else and pulled up the directions to the American embassy and drove there. I was the third person in line to figure out what to do about the shift and how to get home. When it was my turn, I talked with another man turned woman. As I informed him about who I was, he had informed me that he had become his fianc\u00e9. He informed me that I had two choices. Choice one, I could sign up for the first flight to my hometown and I would be out of the country and on my way home hopefully by the end of the month, but I could only take one suit case and one carry-on. I would be out of the country and on my way home hopefully by the end of the month. This was so they could fit as many people on the flight as possible. Choice two, I could wait until the end of the school year, then pack anything I wanted and bring it onto one of the ships the American navy is sending. It would take me home then take anybody who was headed back to Australia home. It would be a longer trip, but I could bring everything I wanted. I thought about it for a minute, then I signed up for the ship at the end of the school year. That was when a thought occurred to me. I need to call home. Quickly, I pulled out Elsa's iPhone and call my phone. It rang for a minute before I herd my old voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, is this Evan\" my old voice asked. It had from what I could tell, a Swedish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, I'm Evan. Are you Elsa\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" I started. \"You wouldn't happen to be with my family\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" she said. \"When this all happened, I wondered around the school not sure what to do next, then your sister found me. She hadn't shifted so she was kind of confused with everything that was happening. She took me to your house and is letting my use your clothes and sleep in your bed. I hope your not offended, but you weren't very fashionable, were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wasn't\" I informed her (him?). \"What about my mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she was swapped into the body of one of your student teachers, umm, Miss Jackson. When the shift happened, she got hit in the head by a book and was knocked out for two hours. When she finally came to the house, Corinne was sure shocked\" she informed me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Jackson was the newest student teacher. She had been assigned to my English class and was super hot and only twenty four years old. She was kind of short, only five foot five, and had some pretty good sized breasts. But now that I'm a girl and she is my mother, it just seems weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" I started. \"Can you do something for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what is it\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you put your phone on speaker and then get Corinne and my mom. I have something to tell you all\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" she said. I listened to nothing for a moment before she told me that everyone was present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" I started. \"Ok so the American embassy opened earlier today, and I was one of the first ones in line. Long story short, after this school year here in Australia I'm coming home on a U.S. Navy ship. Basically, I'm finishing the year here for Elsa. But I was also informed that I will be emailed a list of classes available and creat my own schedule for the rest of school\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great\" a mystery voice said. I think it was my mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that you mom\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes hon. It's me\" she told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. So I'll call again when I'm about to leave. Elsa should do the same thing but head home to Sweden. She will have to fly to the east cost, then get on the ship headed to Sweden\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not so hard\" Elsa said. \"I'll do that, but I'll take some of your clothes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take them all, I plan on taking everything here with me\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" maybe before I leave, we can meet in person\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Listen, I gotta go but I'll call when I leave the country\" I said before hanging up. I drove back to Chloe and Emily's house and told them what I told my family. I also explained that I wanted to learn as much about being a girl as I could before the end of the school year. We spent the rest of the day relaxing and doing nothing specific. In fact, the rest of the day went by uneventfully.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Day 9<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days went by quickly and uneventfully. We mostly watched the news or movies. But today around noon, Chloe came up to me and asked \"Even, can you meet me in your room in like five minutes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I went to my room and waited for five minutes. It felt like five minutes because shortly after I entered my room, so did Chloe. She had a small bag and I didn't know what was inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in the bag\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nail polish\" she said. \"Don't worry, I brought every color I had, and let me tell you, I have a lot of colors for you to pick from\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think I want to paint my nails\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to spend time with someone other that my sister\" she started. \"She has been getting on my nerves over the last few days\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" I said. \"Where do we begin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe first showed me how to use the nail polish remover. Then she let me pick the color. I picked something simple, or so I thought. I picked a silver. My thinking was that it was like a simple gray shirt. It can go with most everything. Chloe didn't say anything about my choice. She showed me how to apply the polish. It must have been pretty simple because I got it quickly. I screwed up a little at first, but I didn't think much about it. It was my first time. After I finished with my fingers, Chloe started my toes. Of course she had me finish them. Once I was finished, she did her own fingers and toes in a light purple color that, while it looked good, was still to girly for me. We went out to the livening room and watched the tv until our nails dried. Some time after they had dried, I went to the bathroom. I was already getting used to having to pee sitting down and wiping once I was done. I looked at myself in the mirror and almost laughed. I looked like a mess. My hair was not made up making me look like I just got out of bed when it was already past one in the afternoon. I found Elsa's hair brush and started to straiten the birds nest I called my hair. Once I had finished I pulled it into the only hair style I knew, a ponytail. I went and rejoined Chloe we continued to watch the news. It had started to have a somewhat normal telecast. While they still covered the great shift for the most part, it had moved from the shift itself to the aftermath of the shift. But there was still a few things on everyone's mind. What caused it, can it be reversed, and when do we restart school. I can't believe it, but I actually wanted to go to school. The rest of the night past and we went to bed as we normally did around ten. I was starting to have an easier time getting to sleep now. And I was a little worried I was adapting to this to quickly. But I could think about that tomorrow. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I told her how I was feeling and she had me rush to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your about to have your first period\" she informed me. She explained everything to me and I started to get scarred. She showed me how to use everything and explained what is going to be happening. She didn't leave my side until it was finished, and I was glad I had her to help me get through this. After the day settled down pretty quickly once it was all over. And I was glad I had Chloe by my side all day. I don't know if I could have handled it. I had adjusted pretty well considering. I mean, I was peeing sitting down without thinking about it. I was watching what I ate somewhat so I don't put on too much weight. I was finally getting used to the feeling of my breasts felt. And I was starting to sleep easy.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Almost instantly I threw the mirror on the floor. It took a lot of effort, but I resisted the urge to freak out. I picked up the mirror again to take a look at my... or rather the new body I now had. I reached for the mirror and gazed into my new reflection. Let me get one thing straight, in my old body, I hated Miley Cyrus. All the girls in my old school were crazy about her. Miley this and Miley that, I was so sick of it, plus her singing SUCKED. And don't get me started on Hanna Montana. Whitch returns me to why, out of all the billions of girls in the world, I was stuck in Miley's body. I countinued to gaze at my new reflection. I raised my hand to brush Miley's... or rather my hair back. Contrary to my old hair whitch was short cut, jet black and filled with chorine (I swam), Miley's hair was shoulder length, silky, light brown with gold streaks. As I pinned my new hair behind my new ears, I noticed pearl earrings on them. I put the mirror down to take a look at the rest of Miley's body. While the hoodie concealed them somewhat, Miley's, er, my breasts jutted out to see. My new hips were so big and wide, that it made my new waist so thin. I gazed at my my new hands whitch were soft and girly, with a manicure and the nails painted red. A diamond ring completed it. I stood up to see around the room. The shoes she... I mean I was wearing were uncomfortable, at least they were flats and not heels. I checked inside, now my, purse. It contained a wallet with only $120 in cash but at least 8 credit and debit cards. I also found an Iphone 4 inside with hundreds of contacts, and some lipstick and makeup inside. Aside from the tv and the bed, the only thing that stuck out in her room was a massive vanity with all types of lipstick, nail polish, and make up. I briefly looked into a nearby floor to celling mirror and found that my new face had some that makeup applied. Very quickly I turned away, my new hair going flying, focusing on the closet in front of me. When I opened the door I discovered a walk in closet with at least a thousand articles of clothing. It ranged from dresses, to skirts, to jeans, to tops, to sweaters, and to other clothing I didn't know was what. The bottom of the racks were hundreds of shoes ranging from flats, to heels, to boots, to sneakers, even for some reason, to dutch wooden clogs. At the back of the closet were drawers containing all sorts of undergarments from lacy bra's to plain panties. In one drawer separate from the rest however there were all sorts of jewelry, like ruby rings, diamond bracelets, and pearl earrings and necklaces. I quickly backed out of the closet and shut the doors. \"Oh my god\" I said, before I stopped when hearing Miley's voice. It was high pitched, girly, and very whiny compared to my old deep voice. \"I really am Miley Cyrus\" I said, still not used hearing Miley's voice as my own.</span></div></div>",

Next thing I knew, I had walked back to the full length mirror. That's when I lost control of my upper body (excluding head). I tried to fight back, but there was nothing I could do. Then Miley's body started striking several poses in the mirror. Next thing I knew however, the body I had, started taking my new clothes off, leaving me staring at the mirror with my hands on my hips, wearing nothing but a bra and panties. Then I was forced into touching my new breasts, while striking poses and admiring them. Then I smiled on my new face, even though I didn't want to. After being forced to observe Miley's body, I put back on my clothes, still having no control over this body. I walked over to the vanity table and sat down still smiling. That's when I started applying makeup and lipstick. I was watching through my eyes still, horiffied at what was going on. After making my hair a little more wavy, I went to my closet to change into a red dress. I went over to the mirror again, and smiled, apprerently pleased with my look. I had lost control of this body and was only watching like a bird trapped in a cage/</span></div></div>",

This is what would be known as \"The Aftershock\" of the great shift. While about 90% of the population swapped bodies during the initial shift, around 50% swapped after this second shift. Chances are, there wasnt a single unswapped person left on the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had blacked out during your second swap. When you came to, you found yourself next to a broken down car on a practically deserted road if not for a few other wrecked/broken down vehicles. You sighed and a sexy tone escaped your lips. your eyes shot open when you then realised you were infact in a different body and you ran to the car as fast as your heeled boots would carry you. you opened the door and jumped into the car before grabbing the rear view mirror and got the shock of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm.....I'm.....!!!!!\" you panted as you noticed the purse next to you. You had to be sure. You opened it and pulled out all the cards until you found an ID card. It read:-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName:- Megan Denise Fox<br>\r\nSex:- Female<br>\r\nBorn:- May 16 1986<br>\r\nNationality:- US Citizen<br>\r\nOccupation:- Actress<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt both shocked and excited. You were in the body of one of the sexiest women on the planet. You began to feel up your new body. Succulent breasts, wide hips, succulent kissable lips, and most importantly the tightest pussy you had ever seen (granted it was the first you had ever seen but whos counting). You resisted playing with your new equipment long enough to get out of the car and start to have a look at your cars engine. You and your dad used to fix cars together so you figured you could give it a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.meganfoxwallpaper.com/walls/transformers/Megan_fox_wallpaper_1920x1440_35.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.meganfoxwallpaper.com/walls/t...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the bonnet and bent over the engine to have a look, not realising how sexy you must have looked to any passersby, if there were any. You began to fiddle around with the engine using your new danty hands, but it wasnt exactly easy. You struggled to the point where your hand slipped and you broke one of your new perfectly manicured finger nails. You never knew what the fuss women always made was about until now, hat hurt! You sucked your injured finger a little before slamming the bonnet shut and giving up. You grabbed your new purse and the car keys just incase and locked the car before picking a direction and started to walk, hoping you would come across civilisation sooner or later. This wasnt going to be easy in your new heels, but it was either that, or risk cutting up your bare feet on the rough ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not easy being a woman!\" you thought absent mindedly as you began to walk</span></div></div>",

Several changes of clothes, toiletries (tampons, eeek!), magazines, and as you dug deeper you found a rampant rabbit sextoy. You blushed a little when you found it and just zipped up the bad and got moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to the reception, but it was abandonned. The only people in the entire motel were a small number of people that seemed to have the same idea as you. So, you broke in to the reception and tok a key for a random vacant room before making your way up to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way up, you could feel the eyes of all the men you passed undressing you. It felt creepy, but also thrilling and seemed to turn you on a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made it to the door and went in, locking it behind you. You threw the bag onto the bed and sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a shower!\" you said before you began to strip infront of the bathroom mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/5400000/Megan-Fox-megan-fox-5471047-1152-864.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked in awe at your now naked body.

He was an attractive man, clean shaven, well built, and around the same age as your new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok darlin'? Need a ride?\" he asked<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, thank you!\" you said somewhat flirtatiously, \"I've been walking for hours!\"<br>\r\n\"You get swapped into that body out here in the middle of nowhere?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, i got swapped by both shifts! the first and the aftershock thingy! How bout you?\"<br>\r\n\"Just the first myself.

Periodically, you could see him eyeing you out of the corner of your eye, undressing you with his eyes. you shook it off and continued to looking out the car window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Jim began to slow down and pulled over to the road side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, i think thats far enough!\" he said, turning off the ignition and turning to you.<br>\r\n\"But....but we're still in the middle of nowhere..\" you protested<br>\r\n\"Look babe, if i'm gonna be driving you any further i need to know if im gonna be getting something out of this or not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to panic now, your heart was racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....what do you mean...?\" you asked, trembling your words<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim unzipped his pants and his huge, 9inch cock popped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to suck it. suck it with those big, juicy moviestar lips of yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?! I'm not going to....\" you began before he pulled out a switchblade<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...said, suck it!\" he said, brandishing the knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were terrified now. What was he going to do to you if you refused? Rape you? Kill you? you hesitated for a moment before slowly scooching closer towards him and burying your face in his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a good girl!\" He said as you took his member into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself easily deep throating his cock. Megan clearly had little to no gag reflex. You slurped and sucked on his cock (somehow expertly) as he moaned and groaned in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, he finally spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna cum, bitch! I'm gonna cum so hard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to pull away but he held your head in place by your hair. You squirmed and groaned a little when you realised what was going on, but it was too late now. You felt his hot spunk squirting against the back of your throat and you swallowed it, just to prevent yourself from choking. It tasted salty, and strangely good for some reason. He finally ran out of seed and he let go of you. You sat up quick as you could and wiped the remaining cum of your lips before Jim spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, that was good baby! We can get going again now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started the car again and you both continued on towards civilasation. You felt violated and in shock after what had just happened, but some small part of you deep inside enjoyed beeing used like that. enjoyed the feeling of a cock in your mouth, and the taste of male seed as it slid down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is happening to me?\" you thought as the car continued along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou were suffering from the effects of your new bodies old personality bleeding into your own. this was something that wouldnt be scientifically identified until months after the shift. For example, a nun who had completely devoted her life to religion and keeping her chastity in tact could end up in the body of a high school slut and still end up having sex with everything that moved. the body in a way took over from the host.</span></div></div>",

I found it at my neck. Panicked, heart racing, I found my hand massaging his cock through his underwear. He moved the blade along my skin. His eyes were having fun watching me struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked me over to the bed &amp; had me strip down to nothing. I felt a tear drip down my face. He licked it off of me &amp; told me to enjoy myself. His free hand made its way to my vagina. The space between my legs became very apparent. Wet. Warm. I could feel my blood course &amp; my hips felt like they wanted to be grabbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis knife hand, keeping the blade at my neck, guided me to a seat on the bed, then pushed me back as he climbed over me. I could feel the heat of his erection over my crotch. I was so afraid, but also growing more curious as my body began to respond naturally. As the tip of his cock slid into my vagina, I felt a range of terrible yet awesome sensations. And before I knew it, I was being fucked. And was somehow enjoying it. The pleasure was incredible, and my body gyrated, gaining what it wanted. I felt it, wet and hot, slipping in and out of me. Filling, then emptying... over and over. Then he buckled &amp; unloaded into me, going as deep as he could. While he was caught off guard, I grabbed the knife &amp; drove it into his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith bulging eyes, I could see him reaching for the knife. I tried to stop him but he continued to fuck &amp; bleed all over me. Apparently I had just cut him, not enough to kill. Then, as he pulled out &amp; pulled me up off the bed, I felt the knife cut a hot line  down my back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI screamed in pain &amp; ran for the door.

In fact, if you were going to be honest with yourself, this room was incredibly girly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it struck you.  This was a girls room.  How did you get here?  You turned your head quickly, and something smacked you in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" you screamed, startled by... hair?  You reached up and grabbed it.  Your hair was shorter... and your scream didn't sound like a guys at all.  You looked down and were met by a surprise.  Two ginormous breasts encased in a tight colorful bra met your gaze.  You slowly lifted your hands and squeezed them, letting out a soft moan as you did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let go, your brain trying to process all the foreign information your body was feeding you.  If you were going to be honest with yourself, that sensation was a little bit too weird for you right now.  You looked around, you had to find a mirror.  Jumping up from where you had landed, you almost immediately fell over again.  You hadn't quite adjusted to your new sense of gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stumble around, you see a mirror.  You almost lunge towards it, not purposefully, you just didn't know how to walk with breasts attached to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you shouldn't!\" your brain was screaming at you, \"You're a guy!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously not anymore.\" you mutter to yourself.  You recognize your voice but you can't place it, you really have to get to that mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly approach it, sucking in your breath and closing your eyes, reopening them you're greeted with the sight of Jessica Nigri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1101897209585389569/pu/img/nvYnIXwttQ6VmgqV.jpg:small\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit.

I looked around, trying to get my bearings, and realized I was in a bed.  A very, very big bed.  I sat up suddenly, and long dark hair fell in front of my eyes.  I reached out to grab it, and felt a tug on my scalp when I pulled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\"  I managed to squeak out, before grabbing my throat.  That wasn't my voice, and that definitely wasn't the voice of a guy.  I looked down and saw breasts, squeezed into a bra hanging from my chest.  I reached up, and lightly touched them, sending a jolt through my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, no way this is real.\"  I tried to convince myself.  This had to be a dream!  I wasn't a girl, I was a guy!  But the hair, and the voice and the... other things.  Those were indicating I wasn't myself.  But who was I?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, I tried to find a mirror, and finally I saw a full body mirror in the corner of the room.  I slowly got out of the bed, adjusting to the balance of the body, and slowly walked over to the mirror.  I could feel the underwear I was wearing riding up into things I didn't want to think about at the moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped in front of the mirror and nearly passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at me from the mirror was Kendall Jenner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fucking way.\"  I was in awe.  That couldn't be me.  I slowly reached a hand up to touch my face, and my mirror image did the same.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Ryan is going to flip out when he finds out about this... but what is this?

I WAS a kind of average high school sophomore... until the Great Shift.  An experiment gone wrong caused most of the world to switch bodies and I wasn't an exception.  Now, well... I'm stuck in a body that's very much not my own.  This is my story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part everything is alright, but there ARE rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1.)</b> Be mindful of grammar.  I don't expect everyone to have perfect grammar but make sure your chapter is readable.  I'll delete it if it's unreadable.<br>\r\n<b>2.)</b> Follow the story.  Taking the story in new directions is fine.  But if you write something that obviously has no connection to the previous chapter(s), it'll get deleted.<br>\r\n<b>3.)</b> Try to keep sex to a minimum.  A little bit is alright, but don't make every chapter about sex or \"playing with my new hot body.\"  If it's over the line, it's gone.<br>\r\n<b>4.)</b> Add CONTENT.  One or two sentences isn't going to cut it.  A paragraph only is pushing it.  If it's just meaningless filler, I'm deleting it.<br>\r\n<b>5.)</b> Don't have the main character switch bodies a lot.  There are \"aftershocks\" but only a handful for the first day or two and they effect less and less people each time so only switch the main character again if you think you've got a good story to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, you can do most anything else so have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm aware that the first chapters are meaningless fluff.  I just wanted to get the \"nothing more than a choice\" chapters out of the way immediately so no matter what, people have something to choose.</td>",
