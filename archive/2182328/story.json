He wiped the sweat from his brow and unshielded his eyes. He looked out on the never ending blue of the ocean. The sun was half-way in the sky. He must have dozed off for several hours as it had only been dawn when he had laid down. He stood up and brushed the sand off of his shorts. He looked out at the empty shore and yawned again, stretching his arms out as he thought to himself. Things had been pretty boring since he and the team had stopped the organization. He had spent most of his days lazing around on the beach and he was longing for something. Perhaps another adventure, or maybe... Something more. \"Oh well,\" he thought to himself and shrugged it off. All he could do for now is see who had some down time...</span></div></div>",

She was reading from a dusty old-looking book. She looked up to see him coming in. \"Hey Sora!\" she said smiling sweetly at him and waving. \"Hey Kairi,\" Sora said as he walked over and sat down on the floor next to her. \"Watchya reading?\" he asked. \"Just some stupid romance thing,\" she said blushing as she closed the book and placed it on the floor.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what's up?\" she asked. \"Nothing. I was kinda bored and thought maybe we could go do something together,\" he said. \"Oh... Sure... I had nothing really planned for today for today so I'm all open,\" she said smiling again. \"So... Whatdya wanna do Sora?\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sora sat and thought for a few moments before coming to what he thought was the best conclusion. \"I know!\" Sora exclaimed. \"It's a beautiful clear day and we've still got like 6 hours of daylight, Let's spend the day out in the sun on the beach.\" he suggested. \"That's a great idea Sora,\" she said smiling brightly. \"I'll go home and get changed and I can bring some sandwiches and fruit-\" \"and I'll bring my radio for music,\" Sora interjected. \"Great!\" Kairi exclaimed. \"Okay so we'll both go home, get changed and meet back at the beach in oh... say... half an hour?\" she asked. \"It's a date!\" he said, realizing how he had phrased too late to change it. Kairi blushed and smiled. \"Guess it is,\" she said and started to move. They both got up and walked to the mouth of the cavern together. She turned to him. \"Okay so I'll see you in a bit?\" \"You got it,\" he replied and they both went off their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>30 MINUTES LATER</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sora laid down the cloth sheet on the ground and spread it out across the sand. He placed his portable radio on the floor and turned it on. An alternative rock song blared through the speaker as he sat down on the cloth and relaxed, looking out at the sea of waves. He heard a noise coming from behind him and turned just in time to see Kairi walking onto the beach with a huge basket in hand. She smiled at him, waved and walked over. She strolled over to him and stopped on the sheet, placing the basket on the center of it. Sora returned his gaze to the wild blue of the sea as she kicked of her flip flops. Kairi casually grasped the rim of her light pink tank top and pulled it up over her head before tossing onto the sand next to the sheet. She then reached for the fold of her jean shorts, unbuttoned them and let them slide down to her feet. She step out of them just as a quick breeze brushed by.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sora looked back and her and was stunned for a moment. There standing tall on the center of the sheet was Kairi, wearing nothing but a tight, revealing light blue bikini. Sora's mouth hung open as he looked at her. It was the most beautiful sight he had ever seen. Her long auburn hair swayed in the breeze as she stood embracing the warmth of the sun. His eyes moved downward to her perfectly formed breasts and continued down, taking in all the details of her exquisite body from her petite stomach, to her smooth toned legs. Sora felt an unfamiliar sensation of warmth spreading in his mid section as he looked at her and imagined to himself what she would look like without her swimwear on.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You okay Sora?\" she asked when she noticed his frozen gaze. Sora snapped out of his intoxicated stupor in time to say, \"Yeah... Sorry.\" She rolled her eyes in a smile and sat down on the sheet next to him. \"You were right Sora, this was a great idea,\" she said smiling as she reached for the basket and opened the lid. she pulled out two bottles of water and a tube of sun block. She handed one of the waters to Sora and then popped open the tube of sunblock before pour a liberal amount of it into her hand. Sora watched intently as she spread the cream between her hands and then reached up to slowly begin applying it to her skin.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She started at her neck, gently massaging the lotion around it and on her shoulders. She slowly working her way down, massaging the lotion into her upper arms and then moving to her breasts. For reasons he didn't understand, Sora's body grew warmer and warmer as he watched her slide her hands underneath her bikini top and rub her breasts. They bounced and jiggled slightly with each motion of her hands. Sora felt beads of sweat slowly form as her hands moved from her breasts down her flat stomach and to the rim of her bikini bottom. She rubbed the lotion onto her stomach and then slid her hands underneath the cotton of her bottom. Sora became flush with heat and felt his crotch growing stiff. \"Was he aroused by her?\" he wondered. \"Hey Sora... Would you mind putting some on my back and legs?\" Kairi asked and made Sora's heart come very close to stopping. \"Uh... S-sure,\" he stuttered nervously. \"Great!\" she said and casually rested stomach first on the floor. She reached back and handed the tube of sunblock lotion to Sora. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Sora got on his knees and positioned himself so that his knees rested at the sides of her thighs. He looked at her bottom and then noticed that it was partially blocked by his swimming trunks. Sora realized that he had developed a massive boner. He ignored it, embarrassed and squished some of the lotion into his hand. He spread it between his palms and then reached forward and put his hands on her shoulder blades. He began spreading it evenly on her back, savoring the touch of her warm, soft skin. As he worked his way down, he took time to gently hug her flesh with his hands and he began to sweat profusely. He reached her hips and kneaded her muscles softly, feeling every square inch of her as his hands moved further down to her behind. She reached back, pulled up on the rims of her underwear and held it tightly in the crack of her buttocks, revealing both cheeks. \"That should make it easier.\" she said continuing to hold the underwear up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sora reluctantly poured more lotion into his hand and the put his hands on her ass. He shuddered at the feel, noticing that her flesh was much softer here. He continued to massage more of the lotion onto her ass. Kairi let go of the underwear but she had pulled it so tight that it stayed wedged in her crack when she did. It had been pulled so tight that he could just make out the darker skin of her asshole. He slid his thumb closer to the the center of her ass and tempted the situation by touching the edge and gently tugging on it. With slightly more force, the small opening slid out from under the cotton of the bottom. He looked closely at the small, tight looking hole. In act of complete thoughtlessness, he brush his thumb across the hole and felt the warmth of it as he passed. Realizing how dangerous his actions were, he quickly let go and moved on to her legs, massaging her thighs, and then finally applying a final coating of lotion to her calves and ankles. \"Okay you're all done,\" he said said as he slid off from on top of her and sat down next to her. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks Sora,\" she said as she sat up and reached back into the basket. \"You hungry?\" she asked as she pulled out something wrapped in a paper towel. He nodded, \"Starving.\" \"Good,\" she said as she unwrapped the paper towel, revealing a plump paopu fruit. \"You know what they say about paopu fruits right Sora?\" she asked. \"Isn't supposed to keep people who share it together forever right?\" he asked. \"Right,\" she replied as she broke the fruit in half and handed him a peice. \"Thanks Kairi,\" he said with a smile He raised the fruit to his lips and then paused. Kairi had hers to her lips as well. \"What?\" she asked concerned. He put his hand on hers and gently nudged it away from her face. Kairi watched him intently as he raised his hand and held his piece of fruit to her lips. A small smile escaped her lips and she slowly arched forward, opened her mouth and took a gentle bite of the fruit. The juice and pulp slowly dribbled down her chin as she pulled away and chewed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sora laughed as it began to dribble down her neck now. \"What?\" she said indignantly with a pout. \"Nothing... You've got stuff all over your chin... come here,\" he said laughing. She slid closer to him still holding the pouting look on her face. He raised his hand again and gently wiped his chin with a stroke of his thumb. He moved his head closer to her face as if he was inspecting her for more bits of food. He rubbed her chin again with his thumb and looked at her eyes as he got just inches away from her face. Her eyelids fluttered a little as he inched even closer. \"Do... I still have... fo-\" she tried to speak but Sora couldn't fight the sudden urge he had and he leaned in, closing the distance and pressed his lips against hers, kissing her with a passion he had never felt before... </span></div></div>",

As if answering his prayers, Kairi gracefully moved and positioned herself to face Sora. She pulled away from his lips for a moment so she move closer to him. She lifted one knee and pivoted to him, resting it down on the side of he butt and the lowered down, pressing her chest and stomach against his and sitting in his lap. Sora put one hand on her back and the other on her waist and then they resumed kissing. Kairi put her hands on his shoulders and let him pull her into him tightly. He couldn't get enough of her sweet soft lips as he continued to caress them with his own. His tongue instinctively worked its way into her mouth and made contact with hers as his hand, as if with a mind of it's own, moved from her lower waist to her butt cheek.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kairi put her hands on his chest and gently pushed him back a little. He adjusted his hands and moved to her waist. She looked at him longingly, her cheeks red. He could tell how nervous she was. He drew his hand to her face and caressed her cheek with the tips of his fingers. Her eyes fluttered closed and she softly nuzzled his hand. As her eyes opened, he looked at her and her beautiful smile once more. He wanted her... No... he needed to be with her. \"Kairi?? he said as he unconsciously gripped her waist tighter. Kairi with her cheeks still red, did nothing but bite her lip anxiously and nod with her approval...</span></div></div>",
