Fish heard something from the left flank. Captain Miller called for a holt, they had not run into a single  german potrol which was odd do to how close they were to the factory, they ahd figured fire team Brovo, which was ahead of them by a courter of a mile and doing recon had silanced the potrol, they ahd found some Germon MP40s on the ground  some time ago&lt; the clips dry so this seemed resonable.<br>\r\n But no one in the unit could come up with a reason why the clips were emty and all the brass was laying on the groun....or where the bodies were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men started to get ready to fight when sudenly a small group of german soldier came out of the trees straight at them, it was a charge. The men opened fire, no one noticed the germans weren't carring any wepons on them and had dried blood on there uniforms, sudenly more came from the trees in front of them and then from the left flanks as well, a scream was heard as two Germans piled onto O'Mally and bit into his neck, tearing the flesh from it as his screasm turned into gurls, the sound of cursing a more frantic shots filled the air as the germsn they ahd shot early got up. the solder weren't dieing like they should, it was taking more ammo then it shpudl to kill the soldiers. as more attacked more allies fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne tackled Pvt Leeland and bite into his arm, he managed to shoot with his .45, but not before it took a huge bite out of his arm. Bingum went over to the wounded solder and croushed beside him, before he ahd a chance to do anyhting 4 germans piled ontop of him and leelans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Miller ordered for the remaisn soldiers to run for the factory. as they ran Johnson, do to the waight of the mortor on hsi abck fell behind and before anyone could do anthing was surounded, his frantic shots were soon drowned out by his screams and the germans soldiers tore him apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ran on Sgt, Brock cursed as he triped and lost his BAR, he had time to get to draw his .357 as he got to his knees and fire one shot beofre he was decended apone and no second shot followed the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Miller turned back to make sure his men were following he felt arms rap around his chest from behind and before he could yell was dragged off into the darkness. Next to go was Tucker who stopped to help Lopez who had stubble and fallen, if he had not done that then Lopez would have been the one who the two germans had sunk there teeth into and dragged to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ran for the buildings more soldiers fell or were draged down by the germans soldiers till just five remaisn, they scattered inn different direction attempting to escape the mad onslight, they were the only ones to reach doors that lead into the factory.....</span></div></div>",

He panted heavly as he looked around and reflected on what the hell jsut happened, what was wrong with those soldiers? he could sware he blew a few of there arms and legs off but thye didn't eve seem to notice, and  he also thought he saw some of there eyes glowing with an inner yellow light. What was going on on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcTavish didn't know but staying here wasn't going to help him any, He checked the clip on the M1, he ahd only fired a few round from it and eh still had 4 fresh mags.  somehow he knew he was going to need every last round of ammo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around te small entry way into what could only bee a barrecks as there was a door that lead to a small one man bathroom to his right, and to the left a shut door that must lead to the main room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly McTavish crept as quietly to the door as he could and then slowly undid the latch. Pushing the door open a crack a smell he was all to familiar with filled his nose and made his eyes water a bit, the smell of decompation. <br>\r\nHe didn't hear anything moving so he pushed the door opent he rest of the way, what he saw made his blood run cold.<br>\r\nthein some of the beds were bloody piles over what could only be human remains. McTavish looked from the beds, the rest of the room wasn't much better. there were pools of blood by the beds from men who made it out of their beds and some even made it to the miffle of the room were some empty shell casing and Lugers layed in the middle of the pools of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made McTavish even more lsot, these men were killed in there sleep, by the looks of it by the same soldiers from outside, why were the g<br>\r\nGermans killing their own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\none this was certain, something was very wrong here.</span></div></div>",

He step through the door and wished he hadn't found out what the noise was, it was flys, 100s of them, buzzing about the three bodies in the room. the room was covered in blood and the walls had smeared hands prints from those who tryed to pull themselves away from there attackers. one of the bodies occupied one of the beds and was obviosely a pationent and the other two seemed to be doctors, or at least that's what Cole thought from there blood stand white coats they wore, the only reconizable thigns on the bloody messes.
