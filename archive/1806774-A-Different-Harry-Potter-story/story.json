Here is my list of the ingredients....\" Harry said, as he pulled out a sheet of paper from his notebook with a list of about eight ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we need to write out how we created the serum using those ingredients...\" John said. \"I hate writing papers like these... My handwriting is terrible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it!\" Sherry shouted. \"I have very pretty handwriting! Plus... I'm part of the team, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe super-muscular girl sat down at John's desk and took a pen in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Let me dictate...\" Harry said out loud, while looking at the list of ingredients for the serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn and Harry dictated out loud as Sherry wrote out a draft of the instructions fro creating the serum. Once she was done, she re-wrote it, so it was easier to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we need to say how the serum was a benefit to you, Sherry!\" Harry wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nobody will bully me anymore, now that I'm big and muscular! Plus, I'm super strong! I can run faster, jump higher, and I can lift heavy stuff! Plus, I can help you guys with just about anything!\" Sherry cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can be our muscle-girl!\" Harry laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that right! I got you guys to thank for these awesome muscles!\" Sherry laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, they were finished writing the paper! It looked beautiful since it was written in Sherry's magnificent handwriting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... How about the three of us go out?\" Sherry suggested. \"Don't worry... I'll protect you guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and John just looked at each other and smiled...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He continued ' After all, we can get our passes from the Headmaster of this school. Hopefully nobody got into trouble this week.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sherry and Harry shook their heads <b>NO</b>.---- After they received their passes, they headed to the Gym. When they arrived, the place did not have too many people there except for a few guys working out. One of them looked remarkably similar to the unpopular and rude student in Slytherin. - Draco Malfoy.  He was bragging that working out all summer and taking a strength potion to enhance it slightly made him stronger. He flexed a fairly good sized bicep for someone his age. Draco did look great for a serious athlete. However Sherry's muscles looked far greater than Draco's muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry sighed, remembering all the nasty things he said to her.  He even pulled a few minor practical jokes too at that time. At that time, John said <b>' Uh oh, is that Draco. We better be careful.'  </b>-- Harry said <b>' But remember Sherry got her muscles too and it is prettier too.'</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry blushed slightly. She did not want John or Harry frightened of her. She said to them in a singsong voice... Let's go to that weight machine on the other side of the gym. I do not want Draco to see me now.<br>\r\nHer voice was so enticing that they simply nodded and followed her to a bench pressing machine. Sherry got underneath it and asked the boys - Can you tell me me how much I will be lifting?  They looked at it and Harry said ' It is not much yet.. 150 lbs.'<br>\r\nSherry said ' <b>Well, I will go ahead and do this lighter one now- maybe really fast.'</b></span></div></div>",

To cause a physical change in another person is not only exciting, but it's a thrill for the person experiencing the change as well. The person administering the potion sees the person change before his or her eyes, but the person who is actually changing gets to experience life in a whole different form, as a different being or animal, or as a thing,or at a different age or size, or stronger or weaker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" several students gasped all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we will be broken up into groups of two, where you will pick a transformation potion. Then, you will look up the recipe and the ingredients for that potion using the spell and potions books. You will create the potion and an antidote as well. Finally, you will choose which one of you will drink the potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape walked around the large lecture hall and assigned the students into pairs, usually assigning the students as they were seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potter... You will work together with Mr. Sanders, who is seated next to you.\" Snape said to him. \"You will create a potion together and try it out. You may choose one from the following. Whichever one you don't choose now, you'll create next week instead. So, you may pick from either a muscle growth potion or a shrinking potion. Which one would you like to try first?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and John talk it out before deciding on creating...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He seem to enjoy deducting points from other Houses when things go wrong or they say something snarly back to Professor Snape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and John whispered quietly as they compared notes. They were so nervous that they made two potions exactly the same.  John said to Harry. ' Hide that in your backpack. We might give that potion to someone who could use it.'  Harry nodded and complied. Fortunately Prof. Snape did not appear to see them do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Muscle Growth potion would be just temporarily effected---usually around 30 minutes for a good one. When Harry and John were ready, John waved for Prof. Snape to come over to watch. Snape then told them to choose one of them to drink it and just to take a sip so it would last 2 or 3 minutes. John nodded for Harry to drink the potion.  Harry drank just enough for about 3 minutes work. It was a successful potion. His biceps grew about 9 inches. If Harry had drank the whole thing, it would have lasted about 30 minutes. Harry felt far more alert than he had been feeling in days. Sadly the effect wore off and his bicep returned to the size of an average boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Professor Snape told them to pour the rest of the potion down the drain NOW. Sadly they complied. Then he said 'well, unfortunately you did Well since both of you are in Ravenclaw. 2 points to your House. Consider yourself lucky that I even gave you points. Now, sit there until class is over.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally class was over and they had a break. John had an idea and told it to Harry.  He said ' Hey, Let us go to the General Recreation Room where all the Houses meet. Let us find someone that can have the strength potion.' Harry nodded. He thought that it would be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived , only one person was there and that person was feeling sad. Harry had the potion in his hand and said  \"This is a Muscle Growth/Strength potion. It would last about 30 minutes. We would like for you to have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sad person's expression changed into a small smile. That person was feeling a bit better and took the potion.

Uhh...\" Neville groaned, as he was overcome by a rumbling feeling coming from deep within his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, all his muscles stiffened up. Neville took a step back, not knowing what was happening to him. Then, every single muscle in his body started to inflate like a balloon! His calves grew bigger and rounder; his quads became wider and thicker; his arms thickened with muscle; his biceps hardened and bulged; his pectorals pushed outwards and sideways; his abdominal muscles became more defined and his torso widened suddenly... All at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at him! It worked!\" John cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel, Neville?\" Harry asked his muscular friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Holy smoke!

We can try to make more later.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville nodded and flexed it a few more times and felt the hardness of the biceps. Neville realized that it would be easier to fight trolls and werewolves in a fistfight, not just using a wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 23 minutes later, his biceps and other muscles slowly began to shrank back to normal.

Can you help us improve it?\" Harry asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very interesting! That would be a worthwhile endeavor!\" the giant man grinned, as he took the bottle and examined the strange contents. \"We should test it on someone short and skinny, just for fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagrid then poured a drop of the potion in another bottle, which had just water in it. Then, he grabbed several other bottles from a large, glass cabinet, which was located behind him, in his office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you add some extract of herbs to the potion, you might increase the duration of the formula!\" he said to them. \"But you don't know that until you let someone else drink some of it! Can you create more of this potion for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! We have the recipe written down!\" Harry explained. \"I have it right here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gave Hagrid a sheet of paper containing the ingredients to his potion and the instructions for creating the right mixture for the magic solution which would cause muscular growth in anyone who would drink from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! Just add thyme and cilantro extract, which are very common herbs and spices, and the effects of your formula should be extended tremendously!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! Thank you, Master Hagrid!\"  Harry smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagrid supplied some extract from the spices in a separate bottle, before mixing them with the original formula in the flask that the boys had given them. Then, he wrote down the modified formula on their sheet of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, go find someone to grant bigger muscles to and try it out!\" Hagrid grinned. \"Then, tell me if it worked or not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Hagrid!\" John and Harry smiled, as they got up and left the room with the flask containing the newly improved muscle potion and the sheet of paper with the modified formula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! First, we test this on a few people! Then, we make more if this!\" John smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but first...\" Harry said. \"Who shall we test this on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to find the shortest, smallest, and weakest person in Hogwarts to give the formula to!

Look at him!\u201d Harry exclaimed, witnessing the amazing transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Wally\u2019s arms and legs began to expand in every direction, growing thicker, longer and becoming stronger, all at the same time! His legs lengthened considerably while his quadriceps expanded with multiple layers of mighty muscles, mushrooming out of his flesh. His calves suddenly blew up like pumped up balloons which were attached to an air pump, growing into powerful, mighty muscles the size of soccer balls. Thick mounds of concrete football-shaped lumps of muscle, divided by a deep crevice, formed over the back of his legs and below his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, his biceps and triceps inflated as his arms grew longer, keeping up with all his other muscles! Thick veins covered his arms and legs as big, round spheres of muscles filled out his arms, his legs, and his mighty, broad shoulders. He began to resemble a cross between a gymnast and a weight lifter and a bodybuilder as his longer legs and arms forced the boy to not only grow more muscular, but almost a foot taller as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the incredible growth spurt finally came to an abrupt ending, it left a huge, super-muscular young boy, standing in the middle of the Ravenclaw Common Room, with huge muscles covering his enormous body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally finally relaxed his arms as he stood there, panting and gasping for air, following the most incredible growth spurt he had ever felt in his life! Huge drops of sweat poured down his face, as the hulking boy tried to make sense of what had just happened to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 What happened?\u201d Wally gasped, as he looked down at his amazing body. Towering almost 6 foot 4 inches tall, Wally almost lost his balance as he slowly too a step forward, feeling the need to adjust to his new weight, height, and size. \u201cWhat\u2026 What have you guys done to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Wally raised his arms, he noted the large rows of bulging muscle on his arms and the thick muscles on his chest and legs. Wiggling the fingers and raising his arms caused biceps and triceps and forearms to flex as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn and Harry slowly walked up to the boy, who was now towering over them by more than 8 inches in height!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Wally! Look who\u2019s the big guy now!\u201d Harry grinned, looking up to the muscle kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally looked down at Harry and John with a smile, for just a moment, until he realized that he was now faced with a new problem\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, Wally had a room which was just down the hall from the two boys. Everywhere he went, everyone just gasped at his new bulk, since they were so used to seeing Wally as a short, scrawny kid. Now that he was big and buff, people had a lot more respect for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Wally walked back to Harry's room, he found the boys almost shivering from the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... We need more firewood, dude!\" John said to Harry. \"It's freezing in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should ask Hagrid!\" Harry sighed. \"He'll get us some more firewood for the fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, Harry... Hagrid's so busy these days... It will take him three days to get us firewood! We'll freeze to death by then!\" John groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, both John and Harry turned and spotted Wally, who towered over them with his broad shoulders and his thick, muscular legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Can't Wally do it?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chop down a tree in the woods outside and then bring us some firewood?\" Harry pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... I guess so! I should be strong enough by now to carry an axe!\" Wally shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get an axe from the tool shed outside and get us some firewood!\" John stated. \"Hercules over here can then chop down a tree for us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys wandered out the door and walked out to the back yard, crossing the huge back lawn behind the Hogwarts castle. From there, they approached a small shed, located near the far end of the lawn. John opened the door of the shed, where he discovered a large assortment of equipment and tools, neatly bolted to a large metal rack on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Here! Here's an axe!\" John said, pointing to the wooden handle which had a sharp metal blade on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally reached over with his two muscular arms, grabbing the handle and holding it with a firm grip, before lifting it off the metal hooks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it heavy?\" John asked the muscle boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little... But I'm still strong enough to carry it!\" Wally smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Let's find us a nice tree to chop down!\" Harry suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys wandered into the woods behind the tool shed, with Wally trailing behind, carrying the axe in his hands. The stopped before a tall, thin tree near the outer row of trees by the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go! Chop it down and then chop it into small pieces!\" John ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally set the axe down for a moment. Then he pulled his sweatshirt over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want my sweatshirt to get all sweaty!\" the muscle boy said, as he tossed his sweatshirt at John. Removing the sweatshirt now revealed Wally's muscular chest and abdominal muscles. \"Here! Hold this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally then lifted the axe by the handle and started to swing it, with the blade pointing towards the stump of the tree, as hard as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUNK!  THUNK!  THUNK!  THUNK!  THUNK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every swing, the groove in the side of the tall, narrow tree got deeper and deeper! Wally started breaking out in a sweat as he worked his bulging muscles. After two-dozen swings of the axe against the side of the tree, the groove in the tree had gotten deep enough, that it had now covered almost half the depth of the tree already! The tree started to sway a little, with every swing of the axe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Wally... I think the tree is about to come down, big guy!\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWally's neck, his face, and his bulging chest was now covered in sweat. He was panting briefly, like he had just come from a serious work-out in the gym! He set the heavy axe on the ground, before he casually walked over to the side of the tree. Then he extended his muscular arms and pressed up against the tree, letting out one more roar of victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HHHHRRRAAARRHH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a mighty crash, the tree came falling down on one side, cashing down onto a large, open field!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! I did it! I chopped down my first tree!\" Wally cheered, raising his mighty arms in victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Wally took his axe and walked over to the tree, chopping it into four smaller pieces. He stacked the four pieces together before lifting them over his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got your firewood!\" he smiled. \"Let's go home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys then turned around and walked back home, happy that they could light a fire in their rooms. And they didn't even have to bother Hagrid for the firewood now that they got their own muscle boy to get the firewood for them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was such an impressive site seeing the big muscle boy hauling the big wooden logs on his large, broad shoulders! It was an amazing feat of muscular strength!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Harry and John went ahead to their rooms as Wally carried the logs to the fire place in the main lounge at the reception hall of the Ravenclaw House. The fire had all but burned out and it was getting quite chilly in the room. So, Wally placed one log in the fire place while he set the other three on the metal rack next to it for future use. He then started lighting the log on fire, while John and Harry were busy walking towards their rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile John and Harry were walking down the hall, another door opened, and a boy wearing a white shirt and black pants came walking out. He had blond hair and blue eyes and a smirk on his face when he saw Harry approaching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well\u2026 if it isn\u2019t Harry Potter!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn and Harry looked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 Hi there, Draco!\u201d Harry said. \u201cWhat brings you to the Ravenclaw House?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since you need to know, Potter\u2026 I was visiting with Neville, who is a friend! And I see that you were walking around with John over here! I heard that you two have been working on some sort of secret potion? Hmm?\u201d he sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhmm\u2026 Yeah\u2026 It\u2019s some sort of a size-changing formula\u2026 We\u2019re still\u2026 refining it\u2026\u201d John responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see!\u201d Draco replied, as he examined John and Harry from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you two certainly don\u2019t look any bigger\u2026 Or smaller\u2026 So did you test it on anyone yet?\u201d Draco asked them. \u201cBecause you are only allowed to test the portions you make on someone who lives within your own house! If you test it on someone outside of your house, then you are in violation of Professor Snape\u2019s class rules and I must report your violation to him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a tap on Draco\u2019s shoulder, from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Neville, what is it? I am talking to Potter! Don\u2019t interrupt me!\u201d Draco sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another tap on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me? I said---\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco turned around and found himself staring at a wall of muscles\u2026 Wally\u2019s abdominal muscles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a large hand reached down and grabbed hold of Draco\u2019s shirt collar, lifting Draco off the floor and holding him suspended above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you bothering Harry and John?\u201d Wally said to Draco in an angry, threatening tone, while holding Draco three feet above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in blazes\u2026. Who\u2026. WALLY?\u201d Draco stuttered, as he looked the giant muscular boy in the eye. \u201cH-h-how d-d-did you get so b-b-big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn and Harry did this to me\u2026 And I LIKE it! Now\u2026\u201d Wally said, as he forcefully set Draco back on the ground\u2026 \u201cGet out of here! GO AWAY!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco turned around and RAN\u2026. Leaving John and Harry laughing out loud as Draco rushed down the staircase of the Ravenclaw House!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn and Harry looked over at Wally. They were so proud of him. After all, the big boy was practically their creation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, big guy!

His biceps swelled a little more as his pectorals pushed out by another two inches! His calves inflated a bit and so did his quads! Wally suddenly looked a little MORE muscular than he was just a minute earlier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! Did you just get bigger?\u201d John asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Yeah!\u201d Wally replied. \u201cI think so!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome!

' You need to return Harry to his normal size first before I can give you two a grade.  ' Then Professor Snape returned to his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Harry had other ideas.

He could feel the excitement build as he read more and more about this weird potion, which was in the small bottle that Harry was currently holding in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you find anything at all?\u201d Harry asked him, as he sat down next to his friend. Both boys sat at a table in the corner of the Ravenclaw Common Room, right by the fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! I got it!\u201d John cheered quietly. \u201cI found it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn pointed his finger at the text which explained the effects of the potion, the ingredients needed to create the potion, and how to make the potion stronger so that its effects lasted longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarry! Look! This potion might only last for a day or so! However\u2026\u201d John read out loud, \u201cWhen mixed with the right ingredients, the effects of this potion can be prolonged from just a few days to weeks or even months! Not only that, if you add stronger herbs and spices, the effects can last up to a whole year!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA whole year?\u201d Harry wondered. \u201cBut\u2026 What are the effects then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDepending on the mixture of three or four key ingredients, and the age, height, weight and body type of the person who receives the potion, that person\u2019s metabolism is increased so high that he or she becomes filled with energy! The recipient of the potion gains the ability to move at increased speeds, especially if the recipient takes a small doze of the potion at the same time every day!\u201d John read out loud. \u201cThe recommended dosage is one teaspoon mixed with a glass of cold water. An athletic person will gain the ability to run anywhere from fifty to over one-hundred miles per hour!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry almost dropped the bottle when he heard the last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay WHAT!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me! An athletic person will gain the ability to run anywhere from fifty to over one-hundred miles per hour!\u201d John repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 But, John! That is insane! Can you imagine anyone running that fast?\u201d Harry gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarry! We gotta give it to someone who likes to run! Somebody who\u2019s active in sports!\u201d John whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Harry said, as he looked up. There were constantly people walking in from the front door to the hallway which lead to the sleeping quarters. Everyone had to pass through the Common Room where John and Harry were sitting, so the location they had chosen to sit was excellent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s sit on the big couch, right between the front door and the hallway!\u201d John suggested. \u201cThat way we can spot every single person coming into Ravenclaw!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and John got up and sat on the long, comfortable couch, opposite the fireplace. They each grabbed a book to read and they occasionally looked up when the door opened and somebody walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes, Rachel, one of the girls had walked in. She was wearing jeans and a t-shirt and high heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi guys!\u201d she smiled as she walked past John and Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Rachel! Do you like to go running?\u201d John asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 Not really. I just go to the gym to lift weights!\u201d she responded. \u201cBut, thanks anyway!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Kevin came walking by. He was about to go outside, wearing a big backpack strapped around his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Kevin!\u201d Harry shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, guys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d John wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going out!\u201d Kevin replied. \u201cGoing camping for a few days in the woods. I just love the outdoors!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Do\u2026 Do you like to go running?\u201d Harry asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 I like to climb mountains and walk along trails!\u201d Kevin replied. \u201cNo running for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kevin turned around and walked out the door, with the big backpack strapped around the shoulders showing his sleeping bag and tent neatly packed up for the night under the stars in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn! I hope we can find someone in Ravenclaw who could try our super-speed potion! I would hate to have to give it to somebody in another house!\u201d John grumbled. \u201cThere must be a few guys in our house who like sports or running or something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, about five minutes later, it happened just like an answered prayer! The front door to the house opened up and a short, skinny boy walked in. He was completely drenched in sweat. He had short, spiky black hair and brown eyes. He was skinny but not too thin either. He seemed rather athletic. In fact, he wore black cleats, white long socks, black shorts and a white jersey with a number and a logo on it. Clearly, the boy had just come from playing soccer since he was holding a soccer ball in his left hand and an empty water bottle in the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys!\u201d Ricky said as he walked up to the water cooler and filled it up with water. Then, he stood there, and drank from the bottle. He was clearly very thirsty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoccer practice!\u201d Ricky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky\u2019s full name was Richard, but since he was a first year student and among the youngest kids at Hogwarts, everybody called him simply Ricky. He was short but stocky, although he wasn\u2019t exactly fat. He had some muscle on him, especially in his legs, most likely from all the running on the soccer field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ricky sat down on the couch right between Harry and John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan\u2026 I\u2019m so thirsty from running up-and-down that soccer field, I could drink a gallon of water right now!\u201d Ricky sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and John just stared at each other and gave one another huge smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Ricky\u2026 Do you run a lot?\u201d Harry asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy of course!\u201d Ricky laughed out loud. \u201cI\u2019m always running! Why do you think I\u2019m always feeling tired and wet and sweaty and stinky all the time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about\u2026 How about we give you something that could make you run\u2026 FASTER?\u201d John asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 How much faster?\u201d Ricky wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA LOT faster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky stared at the two boys in complete disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding, right? This is a joke, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me your water bottle!\u201d Harry said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky handed Harry the bottle which was still mostly full of cold water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 Why are you guys doing this? What are you guys gonna gain from this?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe found this cool potion that raises your metabolism and makes anyone who drinks it able to run at great speed, up to one-hundred miles per hour! But, we have never tested it before! So, we need someone who likes to run to test it for us!\u201d Harry explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot only that, but the potion is temporary so you have to come here and drink it every day around this time. We want to tweak the potion until we can create a version that lasts over a year, rather than just a day or just a few weeks!\u201d John added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 You mean\u2026 If I drink it\u2026 I could be running really fast\u2026 For over a YEAR?\u201d Ricky asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, or even longer if you help us develop the potion!\u201d Harry instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026 I would be the fastest kid in Hogwarts\u2026\u201d Ricky pondered out loud. \u201cI would be the fastest kid on the planet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got that right, hot-shot!\u201d Harry said, as he poured the contents of one-teaspoon of the potion in Ricky\u2019s water bottle and then shook the bottle a few times so that the potion had enough opportunity to mix with the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere! Drink up! All of it! Quickly!\u201d Harry ordered, as he handed the bottle to the soccer player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2026 It\u2019s not gonna hurt or make me sick or anything, right?\u201d Ricky asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! You got nothing to worry about! It will only make you do everything faster!\u201d John laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh okay\u2026\u201d Ricky said as he looked at the water bottle, which he was holding in his hands. \u201cI guess this is my last moment of normalcy! Bottom\u2019s up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky closed his eyes as he craned his head backwards while placing the spout of his water bottle between his lips. He then started gulping down the cold water, which was mixed with the super-speed potion, which Harry had poured into the bottle just moments before. After a minute, he had finished every drop of water in the bottle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew! I\u2019m no longer thirsty!\u201d Ricky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Do you feel anything?\u201d John asked the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got more energy! I feel more awake! I feel like I can do more things! I can do stuff faster!\u201d Ricky said excitedly. \u201cLike I just gulped down a really intense energy-drink!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go outside and see how fast you can run!\u201d Harry suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! But then I need to take a shower and study! I have math homework!\u201d Ricky said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! You\u2019ll do everything really fast! Including your homework!\u201d John laughed as the three boys walked out the front door of the Ravenclaw House. They stared out the courtyard and looked out over the road and the vast, expansive lawn before them. Far off in the distance, at the end of the road, they saw the mailbox at the gate to the entrance of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRicky! Go ahead and run to the mailbox and back!\u201d John suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Ricky said as he turned around and started running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it seemed like he was running at normal speed. But as the seconds ticked off the clock, it appeared as if he was running faster and faster! Then, it seemed like Ricky arrived at the mailbox in no time at all! He opened the box and checked for mail before he ran back, this time increasing his overall speed again! This time he came back even quicker than before and appeared standing before Harry and John in just under ten seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! That was great!\u201d Ricky said, as he ran about thirty yards to the mailbox in three seconds and he did not even seem tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn! That was fast!\u201d John exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll test you again, after you had another dosage tomorrow!\u201d Harry said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Time to shower and get dressed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ricky was no longer like any other ordinary student of the Ravenclaw House at Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Magic.

He opened the large drawers and pulled out his shirt, his socks, his underwear and he found his shoes. He tossed everything on the bed, which he made in a fraction of a second. Then, his body practically transformed into a blur as he ran out the bedroom and down the hall, beating out all the other boys in the House and being the very first in line for the showers. He turned on the water and showered, enjoying the nice hot water. He covered his body with soap at amazing speed, but he had to wait for the water to rinse him off. Once he was done, he leaped out of the shower and grabbed a dry towel and dried himself in just two seconds. Finally, he raced back into his bedroom, just as the other boys were barely making it into the bathroom. After another five seconds, Ricky was completely dressed, his teeth brushed and his hair combed, and he ran as fast as the wind down to the large dining hall, beating out everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn!

Professor Flitwick smiled at his succesful spell and said ' Great job, Rick. 10 Points to the Ravenclaw House.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was time for the class to do their own individual study in the Thicker Texbook. Ricky tried not to read too fast but he could not help himself. He was reading it in superspeed. In fact, Rick read it through 3 more times to be sure that he retained what he learned. Then he started writing it in his quill. The quill actually broke once because he wrote too fast. The second time, Rick managed to slow down slightly due the the spell slowly wearing off.

Finally, after a few minutes, he got to the ladder, which he grabbed hold of quickly. Neville slowly climbed up the ladder, which was hard, since his clothes where soaking wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... I'm c-c-cold...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get out and stand on the pier!\" Ricky ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Neville made it on the wooden deck, Ricky appeared standing next to him. He took hold of Neville's hand, teleporting both of them back to the Ravenclaw House where Neville was able to take a nice, hot shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and John saw that the two boys had disappeared and they quickly ran into the house as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, John, Harry, and Ricky met up in the Ravenclaw lounge to discuss what Malfoy had done... In the meantime, John had started working on a new potion which he could only trust Ricky to test!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They had beakers, measuring cups, numerous instruments, an old oven and a freezer at their disposal. They also had small trays in a closet containing hundreds of different herbs and spices and chemicals all stored in different bottles. These were the ingredients which were used to mix together and create new potions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mixing these ingredients together will affect the neuro-sensors in the human brain...

He felt uncomfortable even trying a modified version of it on a live human. But this potion was already approved for human use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen George and Laura walked in. Laura was holding on to George's arm when they came in. Laura also had a slight limp as she walked. Laura smiled at George as she took a seat near Harry Potter. She replied 'Thank You, George, for walking me in.'  Draco was a jerk for pushing me aside like that and causing me to fall down. I do not want to keep you from your studies. Go ahead and go to the library. I will be OK here.'    George nodded as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry angrily to her said ' Is Draco still acting like a jerk. How dare he ! '  Laura said ' Relax, I already been to the Hogwarts Infirmary and Pomfrey treated me. It was successful that I was just there for maybe 15 minutes. I just need to take it easy for a few hours before I can starting jogging....I do like to jog a lot. It helps release my stress here.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and John looked at each other and winked at the same time. John held out a potion and said 'This approval potion can help you with your speed---temporarily. Maybe you would like to enjoy being much faster temporarily.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's face beamed in excitement. She exclaimed ' Yes, I realize that. It can make one gain an additional 50 to 100 MPH while running, depending on the strength of the potion. And it will last from about 3  to 6 hours too. One should not take more than 2 spoonfuls--otherwise there can be unfortunate side effects, espcially more than 3 spoonfuls.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then replied ' Well, then one should not take more than 2 spoonfuls right now. Come on outside with us. We want you to take it. Besides it is a minor healing potion for slightly sprained ankles and tendons in the legs,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly they helped her out of the castle. Then outside, Laura smiled and said ' I am ready for my 1 spoonful. I want to be careful this time. ' Then they carefully pour the potion on her spoon and into her mouth. They they waited briefly to see if Laura felt any differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura adjusted her school cap on her head and commented 'Well, it did taste like lemon juice but.....'  But, at the moment,  a gust of wind blew her cap off her head and sent it sailing down the long school yard. Laura said with a wink 'Guess I better get it back.. first, I better be sure to see if my shoes are tied....Yep, it is tied. Then she gave a wink and took off in a flash.' ZOOOM  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was running really fast now. John estimated that she was running about 75 mph. She retrieved her cap and placed it back on her head. And she had a big smile on her face. Then she noticed something far in the distance. Both of them were even farther from where she first started chasing her cap.</span></div></div>",
