She is relatively short and thin at 5'3 an 97 pounds. She generally wears form fitting clothes that occasionally shows her midriff, and has little skill in combat, being more of a runner then fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie is a sleek tan fox with brown hands and paws, sporting a pale white underbelly that mostly stays hidden in a sleek wetsuit. At about 5'8 and 130 pounds he can take a hit or two, but uses his mind to think of ways to outsmart his opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael is a large red dragon who's underbelly takes on a soft gold, running all the way to his tail. He stands tall at 6'9 and 254 pounds, and generally he doesn't wear too many clothes, but he can be seen occasionally wearing bulky clothes. He is pretty strong in fights, able to stand against bullies in his youth, although he may not be the most clever and quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNysaa is a slender light blue bird, looking somewhat like a mocking jay. She is extremely light at 5'5 and 80 pounds, mostly from the fact she has to keep herself like that to fly. Because of this, she never wears clothes unless necessary, and is completely reliant on her wings to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Your Choice- Feel free to make you character and choices, I'll look over them and see if I can add some to them to help get the ball(oon) rolling c:</span></div></div>",

She heaves herself up and yawns, trying to banish the rest of the sleep away while going around in her little camp. The blue bunny has been on the run ever since she saw some AIs take over her town, quickly packing up a medical cot, a blanket, and a tent before running into the forest, where she has been living in since. Amelia steps out of the tent and looks around: her fireplace was smoldering from last night, thankfully not attracting anything while a few logs have been set around in makeshift seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs softly and picks up her bag to start foraging for some food, being cautious. Normally she would've been comfortable with her intimidate surroundings, but as time went on, she had to go further and further away to find food, making her worried that she may run out soon. She was soon stopped as she noticed something ahead in the unexplored area of the forest, which was.....</span></div></div>",

Looking around, she cautiously goes towards the pile, which had several vines spread around the ground with flowers decorating all over the sides of them. When she does get close to it, she looks over to the bush, shrugging the odd plant off as she began to pick the berries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vines start to move, starting by going over her paws, and then gingerly wrapping around her ankles. The bunny did not notice all the while more of the plant came to life and goes around her waist, before tugging her back onto the grass with a squeak in surprise! She wriggles and squirms in her confines as the plant only grew tighter around her ankles and wrists. One large vine soon comes out of the bundle of vines and pushes itself into her mouth, muting any cry for help as she could feel something being pumped into her mouth, forcing her to gulp it down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
