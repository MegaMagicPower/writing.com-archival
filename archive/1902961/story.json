Several fire engines were called to the scene, along with police and ambulance units. The reporters at the Daily Planet were listening in on the police scanner also heard the news, and Perry White had sent Lois over to get the story, and Jimmy Olsen to take pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLois arrived there first, with Andrew James the camera man. She set up the live TV camera just outside, since she couldn\u2019t get any closer due to the smoke and the fire. Police units had the entire area blocked off, but the burning building had provided a stunning backdrop for her live report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Jimmy had parked his small car in the back of the large plant, and he managed to sneak inside through a cargo delivery door. He turned on the flash on his camera, and he immediately started taking pictures inside of the plant. The fire was apparently on the other side of the building, or so it seemed that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jimmy was roaming around the plant, Superman had just arrived on the scene. The fire had gotten out of control, and the Man of Steel managed to rip off several plates of steel, using his heat vision to solder the plates together to create a large steel bucket. He flew the bucket over to the nearby lake, scooping up hundreds of gallons of cold water, before flying back to the fire and dousing the flames with a large quantity of water!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jimmy walked past a large machine, which was damaged by the fire. As he approached it, he raised up the camera to take its picture. Just then, the machine short-circuited, and a mighty blast of energy was emitted from the machine, which struck Jimmy in the chest! The energy blast was blue and red-colored, and it caused the machine to overload! This was followed by a loud explosion, which left Jimmy lying unconscious on the hard, concrete floor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Superman said, as he heard the explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Man of Steel ran into the plant at super speed, only to find Jimmy Olsen, on the floor. He picked up Jimmy and his camera, and flew him out of there, just before the machine exploded!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Jimmy was rushed to a hospital, with Lois and Clark standing by his side. A doctor had examined him, and had determined that Jimmy had been exposed to some sort of chemical radiation. So far, they thought that Jimmy would be okay; however, they wanted to keep him for a few days, in case there were any side-effects\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jimmy Olsen had been unconscious for about three hours when he finally began to open his eyes, followed by a loud groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh\u2026 My head hurts! What the hell happened?\u201d he moaned, as he turned his head and looked around the room. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the hospital right now, Jimmy! You were at the chemical plant, and one of the machines had zapped you with some chemical beam of radiation or something and it knocked you out! We don\u2019t know what happened, but the doctor had checked you out!\u201d Clark explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh man\u2026 My camera! Have you seen my camera?\u201d Jimmy wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s right here, Jimmy! Don\u2019t you worry about that right now! Just get well!\u201d Lois said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now that he\u2019s awake, I guess I\u2019ll head back to the office. It sounds like he\u2019ll be okay!\u201d Clark said to Lois. Clark then said goodbye and left the room while Lois stayed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Uhh\u2026 I need to get the pictures back to the Daily Planet for the paper tomorrow\u2026\u201d Jimmy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! You listen here, Jimmy! You were exposed to some sort of radiation! You\u2019re going home and you\u2019re going to stay home tomorrow and get a day\u2019s worth of rest! Is that understood?\u201d Lois said in a stern tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Miss Lane! I feel fine!\u201d Jimmy replied. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m taking you home as soon as the doctor says you\u2019re okay!\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the doctor arrived, carrying several papers and a few x-rays in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, seems like Mr. Olsen here got zapped by some weird device! He\u2019s been exposed to high levels of zeta and epsilon kappa radiation!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 What\u2019s that mean, doctor?\u201d Lois asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know! It\u2019s an unusual combination and we\u2019ve never had anyone experience any level of exposure to this type of radiation before! So, I will release Mr. Olsen, but as soon as he sees or feels anything funny or unusual, I want to report that to me right away!\u201d the doctor instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, doctor! Other than that, I\u2019m feeling fine!\u201d Jimmy responded. \u201cHonest! I want to go home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll your vital signs are good. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with him. You\u2019re free to go!\u201d the doctor said, as he handed Jimmy a plastic bag containing his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy hopped out of bed, removed his hospital gown, and put on his clothes. Then, Lois walked him over to the front desk, where he filled out some papers. From there, they went to the parking garage and got in the car, and Lois too him home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for him, he only lived ten minutes from the hospital so he was home in no time at all. As soon as Lois had dropped him off, he changed clothes, he fed Alvin, his black cat, and he turned on his TV. He was starving and no wonder since he hadn\u2019t eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy put on a comfortable t-shirt and shorts, and he sat down on his couch. He basically got the day off, as well as the following day, on doctor\u2019s orders. He got zapped with unknown quantities of a strange combination of radiation, and he could experience unexpected side-effects from it. But, truth be known, he really wasn\u2019t worried since he was feeling great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate a ham and cheese sandwich with a glass of milk. He ate everything, since he was so hungry. When he was done, he felt very tired, so he turned off the TV set and crawled in bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, he woke up, feeling very constricted by his shirt. In fact, his t-shirt had gotten very tight around his chest and shoulders. It was as if his shirt had suddenly shrunk in the wash! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh man\u2026 I thought this shirt was rather big on me? It\u2019s killing me!\u201d he groaned, as he turned on his back while lying on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy also noticed that his chest and arms felt a little heavier. That was strange! What was going on here? His shirt sleeves were killing him. He had to get this shirt off of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy raised up his arms and stretched them out when suddenly his sleeves tore! Both ends!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRRRRIIIPPPPPPP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis biceps tore holes in both sleeves of his t-shirt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he rolled around on his stomach and pushed down on his bed, using his hands, while flexing his pectorals. This strained his shirt even more, causing the front of the shirt to rip from the collar down the middle as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRRRRRIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap! I just tore my shirt to shreds!\u201d he gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy reached down and practically ripped the rest of the thin, cotton shirt off his back with his bare hands! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he got off his bed and examined his reflection in the mirror. His pectorals had expanded a bit, his biceps were bigger, and his abdominal muscles had gained some definition. He now had lats under his arms and his quads were beginning to grow thicker and wider. He realized that he had started to gain some muscle overnight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck? Where did that muscle come from?\u201d he wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it pure coincidence? Or could it have anything to do with the accident in the plant? Jimmy was going to stay home the next day and see what happens\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jimmy went to bed that night wearing only a pair of shorts and his underwear. So, when he woke up the following morning, he was greeted by his handsome chest, bulging biceps and his thick arms when he examined his reflection in the mirror. He was as muscular as he was the previous night, but it seemed like he now had some additional veins which had popped up in his arms and legs as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness! How can I possibly become so muscular without even going to the gym and lifting any weights at all?\u201d he wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy then walked over to the closet and rummaged around, realizing that he came across several clothes which probably didn\u2019t fit him anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang! I need to go clothes shopping now!\u201d he sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve outgrown some of my shirts and shorts already!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found a large pair of sweatshirts and sweatpants, which had always seemed big on him. So, he slipped into the gray sweatshirt and sweatpants, which were indeed a size too big, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not gonna outgrow these anytime soon! So, I might wear these today while I stay home!\u201d he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy prepared a bowl of cereal as he turned on the TV and watched the local news, before changing the channel to some sports station, which was showing a football game. He watched that for a while until he got bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get some fresh air outside!\u201d he decided, as he put on thick athletic socks and his walking sneakers before he headed out the door. He walked around the block, saying hi to a few people who were walking around the neighborhood. Of course, nobody noticed anything unusual about Jimmy since he was wearing those big, oversized sweats. He just looked the way he always looked, but with sweatpants and a big sweatshirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked several blocks, not realizing offhand that his muscles were slowly growing bigger and bigger, slowly filling out his sweatshirt and his sweatpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of walking around the neighborhood and saying hi to several of his neighbors, he began to notice that his sweatshirt started to feel a little tighter. Not just that, but his baggy sweatpants didn\u2019t fit that loose anymore, either. In fact, his sweats started to get pretty tight after a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Jimmy started walking back to his house, the sweatshirt fit very tight around his chest and abdominal muscles. It felt so tight; it began to hurt him in his chest and in his shoulders. His legs began to ache, especially around the quads and calves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn! What is up with these clothes? I thought they were too big on me! They\u2019re killing me now!\u201d he grumbled, as the sweatshirt was fitting very tight around his arms and his chest. The outlines of his pectorals began to show in the front, and the shapes and the curves of his biceps were beginning to form in the sleeves as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap! These sweats couldn\u2019t just shrink? I didn\u2019t wash them! I\u2019ve been wearing them for the past hour!\u201d Jimmy complained as he started walking to his house at an accelerated speed. But the pain in his legs had become almost unbearable! He had to stop, even though he was only two blocks from his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuts! I don\u2019t want to walk the rest of the way in my underwear! My legs are killing me! What\u2019s up with these sweatpants? They\u2019re too small on me now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened! Due to all the walking around, his muscles in his legs had grown more than all his other muscles! So, his quads and his calves were at the point where they would practically explode out of his sweats!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, two giant holes were blown out of the back of his sweatpants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRIPPPPP!!!!!!!! CRACKKKKKKK!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis massive calves had completely burst out of the back of his sweats! They had completely grown out of them, and exploded out of his sweatpants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap! I just tore holes in my\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy sweatshirt finally gave way to his growing chest and shoulders, ripping clearly down the middle from the shirt collar all the way down to the abdominals in one long vertical line! The big tear in the sweatshirt revealed his huge, bulging pectorals and his impressive washboard abdominals!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d better get home!\u201d Jimmy panicked as he sprinted home, but not without passing Mrs. Jones, one of his neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jimmy!\u201d she said to him, while watering the plants in her garden. \u201cYou\u2019ve been working out, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026. I guess you could say that!\u201d Jimmy replied shyly. He really didn\u2019t know what else to say!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got to the house, he got inside and closed the door, just as he tore the rest of the sweats off of him so he could throw them in the trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I really need new clothes!\u201d Jimmy groaned. \u201cBig, new clothes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy looked for the biggest shirt and shorts he could find, put them on, and got in the car. Then he drove to the mall where he went shopping for some clothes, extra-large size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He stood up and groggily stumbled his way to the bathroom, almost ripping the doorknob off the door with his amazing strength. He walked in and stared at his reflection in the mirror, which confirmed what he feared: His muscles had expanded even more overnight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lats were astounding and his shoulders were amazingly wide, practically spanning four feet across! His pectorals were like big, solid spheres of hard-rock muscle, implanted in his chest and sticking out from his bulging chest like massive boulders of steel or armor. His biceps were beginning to look like beach balls now, and they were the size of footballs that were implanted in his arms, with a long, thick vein running over each muscle.  As he backed off, he could just barely make out the thick, massive quads, that were now as thick and as wide as steel columns, and finally, those bulging calf muscles, which were now bigger than soccer balls, sticking out from the back of his legs below the knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly mackerel! I\u2019m beginning to turn into a muscle man!\u201d Jimmy gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next issue was finding something\u2026 Anything to wear that would fit his growing, muscular body! Every shirt that he pulled out of his dresser was too small. What a pain! He pulled out one shirt after another, only to throw them into a pile on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man\u2026 I got nothing to wear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he found his bathrobe, which was hanging from the bathroom door. It was the only thing that still fit him, since it was only fastened by a cloth belt that he would fasten by tying a knot together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the phone rang in the kitchen. Jimmy quickly walked over to answer it right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Oh, hi Mr. Kent! What? Oh, I\u2019m feeling much better! I should be into work tomorrow\u2026 I... Uhhh\u2026 I may need to buy some clothes first\u2026. Why? Well\u2026 Let\u2019s just say\u2026. Uhmm\u2026 My muscles have grown a little bit\u2026. I have no idea why\u2026. I\u2019ve been getting bigger and bigger\u2026 I swear! I look like Superman now! You\u2019d be proud of me! You think I need to see a doctor?  Well, I just got my bathrobe to wear right now\u2026 You think I need to go to S.T.A.R. labs? Really? Oh, well, sure\u2026 If you think so\u2026. Sure, Mr. Kent! Bye!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy brushed his teeth and combed his curly hair. Within seconds, there was suddenly a knock on the front door of his small apartment. When Jimmy opened up, he saw the Man of Steel standing before him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly smokes! Superman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, Jimmy!\u201d Superman said to him. \u201cI heard that you\u2019ve been experiencing some of the side effects of the radiation from the other day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Yeah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you show me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026 Look!\u201d Jimmy said as he removed his bathrobe, revealing his incredibly muscled body. In fact, Jimmy began to appear to have slightly larger muscles than Superman at this point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat Moons of Krypton!\u201d Superman exclaimed. \u201cHow did you become so muscular?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I have no idea, Superman! My muscles just started to grow and grow and grow!\u201d Jimmy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think we should have someone take a look at you! Let me fly you over to the lab, just to be on the safe side, okay?\u201d Superman suggested to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Superman! I appreciate it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twosome then stepped outside, where Superman carefully lifted Jimmy\u2019s body up and held him with one arm under his knees and the other under his shoulders. Then, Superman lifted off, flying northbound, towards S.T.A.R. labs, where Dr. Hamilton could check him out and see if he was in any kind of mortal danger or not\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What can I do for you?\u201d the doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoctor, Jimmy has been exposed to radiation at the chemical plant several days ago. Even though the radiation doesn\u2019t appear to be life-threatening, there have been some visible side-effects to this exposure. We just wanted you to look at him.\u201d Superman explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhmm\u2026 Sure! Let\u2019s have a look!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy stood up and removed the bathrobe, revealing his incredibly muscular body! His pecs were truly enormous! They were sticking out like two giant globes of steel! His abs were stunningly defined as well. His quads were very thick and wide and his calves were the biggest calf muscles the doctor had ever seen! Jimmy couldn\u2019t walk anymore without the bulging quads and calves rubbing up against each other, due to their width. Not only that, but Jimmy also seemed a little taller than before! It appeared that he may have grown a few more inches over the past day or so!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Talk about a bodybuilder!\u201d the doctor exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the thing, doctor! Five days ago, Mr. Olsen was thin! He was only 150 pounds and 5 foot 4 inches tall!\u201d Superman explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026 My muscles are still growing!\u201d Jimmy said quietly. \u201cI wake up feeling bigger and heavier every morning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! We\u2019ll take all the measurements. I\u2019ll need some blood samples, and I\u2019ll take some x-rays. Then I need you to stay overnight so I can do it again tomorrow morning and once more in the afternoon!\u201d the doctor instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hamilton led Jimmy into a hospital room where he was hooked up to an IV. They took his blood and they ran some tests. Then he had some dinner before he fell asleep. The following morning, he woke up and the nurse checked his weight and vital signs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon, Jimmy went to a small gym in the hospital where he checked his strength. He bench-pressed over 700 pounds and he was able to lift more weight than he had ever lifted in his entire life! He felt stronger than ever! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the doctor came, his height and weight was measured again, before he got his lunch. Superman also returned to check up on his friend. When Jimmy got out of bed, Superman noticed that Jimmy was about as tall as him, standing 6 foot 3 inches tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJimmy has grown another 3 inches in height\u2026\u201d Dr. Hamilton noted. \u201cNot only that, but he has gained about thirty pounds in muscle overnight at the same time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs he gonna keep on growing like that?\u201d Superman asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me keep him here for a few more days so we can run some tests on him. That\u2019s the only way we can find out!\u201d the doctor replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy just watched TV and played games on the computer. He also went swimming in the pool and he lifted weights in the gym for an hour. When he returned to his room, he felt as if his body had continued to grow again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third day was no different! When Superman arrived to visit him, Jimmy got out of bed and was shocked when he noticed that he was now towering over the man of Steel! He was at least 6 foot 6 inches tall, making him 3 inches taller than Superman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Superman! I\u2019m taller than you!\u201d Jimmy grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman couldn\u2019t believe it! He was now looking up to Jimmy Olsen! Not only was Jimmy taller than him, but his muscles also seemed far bigger than his own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re becoming quite a large man for your age, Jimmy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 Uhh\u2026 I guess so, Superman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy just chuckled. He would never have imagined that one day he would be bigger and more muscular than Superman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hamilton came to draw blood once again and to check his vital signs. Then he sat down in the hospital room where Jimmy stayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 Jimmy\u2019s muscle growth was indeed triggered by the radiation exposure. The good news is that we think that the growth is slowing down very gradually. The bad news is\u2026 It may take a few more days before the growth stops! So, Jimmy will still grow another foot taller before his muscles quit growing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d Jimmy cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then? Will that be the end of it?\u201d Superman wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know. He will stop growing any bigger for now. But that is no guarantee something else might trigger a growth spurt in him! Like, some food or medicine could cause him to have little growth spurts! But we don\u2019t know about them until it happens!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman took a deep sigh. The only thing he could look forward to now, is Jimmy Olsen becoming a huge muscle giant of a man\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Labs where he grew another 8 inches, 6 inches, and finally 4 inches taller respectively, until it seemed as if his growth had finally stopped on the fourth and final day. But, when Jimmy got out of bed on the fourth day and greeted Dr. Hamilton, the doctor was greeted by a huge, eight-foot tall muscle giant of a man with curly red hair and giant muscles, weighing over 500 pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Olsen, there really isn\u2019t much of anything else I can do for you here!\u201d the doctor said, grinning slightly as Jimmy had to duck in order to get under the door frames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh, I need to get used to ducking or bending down in order to get through buildings! These doors aren\u2019t made for people who are eight feet tall!\u201d Jimmy grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, they\u2019re not!\u201d the doctor laughed. \u201cWell, shall I call a cab for you so you can get home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I won\u2019t fit in an ordinary car! You need to call my work at the Daily Planet and see if you can get a hold of Mr. Kent! Ask him to get a hold of Superman!\u201d Jimmy instructed the doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor dialed the newspaper\u2019s office and got a hold of Clark Kent, telling him that Jimmy was ready to be picked up by someone since he was ready to be released from the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, the Man of Steel himself landed before the main entrance of the lab and walked in the main entrance, asking for Jimmy and Dr. Hamilton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Superman!\u201d Jimmy said as he smiled and waved his huge hand. Of course, Superman was looking straight at Jimmy\u2019s abdominal muscles. He had to crane his neck in order to see Jimmy\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly smoke! You\u2019re really, REALLY BIG!\u201d Superman exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you fly me home? Please?\u201d Jimmy asked politely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuperman had to struggle a bit to get a grasp on Jimmy\u2019s big, hulking body, since he was so large! He wrapped his one arm around Jimmy\u2019s back legs, as far as he could, and the other arm rested against Jimmy\u2019s big, broad shoulders. Jimmy was almost too big for Superman to carry, but he just barely was able to lift him, carefully carrying him through the air and flying him to the rooftop of the Daily Planet building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, when Superman had set Jimmy down on the roof, he couldn\u2019t help but stare in awe at his best friend and colleague. The shy reporter and photographer had truly transformed into a big, hulking muscle giant, who was now towering over him! He was now looking down on everybody, even Superman, by more than a foot-and-a-half! Superman was staring straight at Jimmy\u2019s massive wall of abdominals, since the young man was so gigantic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy stepped closer and asked Superman something he always wanted to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuperman\u2026 May I\u2026 lift you up? I\u2019m just dying to do that!\u201d he asked his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 Sure, Jimmy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy slowly approached his hero and gently placed his huge hands under Superman\u2019s arms. Then, he slowly lifted up his big hero, raising him until the man of Steel was at his eye-level. As Superman looked down, he realized that his legs were dangling almost two feet above the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! This is so exciting! I\u2019m holding Superman in my hands! This is amazing! You\u2019re not even heavy at all!\u201d Jimmy exclaimed. \u201cPlus, you\u2019re so small!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Superman chuckled. \u201cEverybody\u2019s small compared to you, Jimmy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can use my size and strength to help you!\u201d Jimmy suddenly suggested. \u201cWhat do you think? After all, now I got super strength!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026 Perhaps! We could get you a big outfit to wear!\u201d Superman suggested. \u201cTake a day to think it over, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! Thanks, Superman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jimmy went inside of the building where he went straight into his office. Of course, everybody was amazed by his height and his huge muscles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Superman flew around and changed into his normal clothes, so Clark Kent could greet him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large crowd formed around the giant young man as he walked around the hallway. Everybody came to greet the big, 8-foot man with giant muscles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy was enjoying his new popularity as a muscle giant! But, could he also become a new superhero?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

An alarm had gone off in the middle of the night, and several police officers were dispatched to the lab following a report of a mugging. A young woman had her purse snatched while walking down the street. Minutes later, a student got robbed at gunpoint. Obviously, a criminal was on the loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo officers were walking around the lab looking for the suspect, using flashlights as the scoured the outside of the lab. But the police Commissioner wanted extra help, so he turned on the famous bat-signal. Batman called him on the bat-phone, and the Commissioner explained what the situation was. Within minutes, the Bat mobile was speeding towards the lab at the university.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dynamic Duo leaped from the Bat mobile and started wandering around the area surrounded the lab where the woman got mugged. Batman spotted a small cosmetics box and a brush on the ground, clues which indicated that things had fallen from a female\u2019s purse during a struggle. As they walked further, they spotted an open door, leading into the lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe robber went into the lab! You go to the left, Robin!\u201d Batman instructed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll look to the right!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin carefully wandered around, walking among several machines, chemical beakers, large computers, and other scientific equipment until he suddenly heard a sound like a coin dropping to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! You! Over there!\u201d Robin shouted out so a man wearing a black shirt and gray shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man started running away with Robin in pursuit. He threw empty canisters and glass beakers to the floor in his attempt to slow Robin down, but Robin was able to leap over the obstacles. When Robin had almost caught up to the man, he made a mighty leap into the air and jumped on top of the man's shoulders!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was slightly taller than Robin, and he bent over forward and he threw Robin on to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran a few yards until he came to a large metal drum containing a green, thick liquid. The drum was ten feet wide and six feet deep. The man had no other place to go, as Robin was about to jump on top of him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the man lifted Robin\u2019s body over his head, and raised him up all the way using his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBatman! I got him! OVER HERE!\u201d Robin shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Robin could do anything else, the man hurled Robin into the large drum, which contained the strange, green chemical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud plunge, Robin sank into the green liquid. He was completely underwater, until he finally came to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man saw that there was a switch on the outside of the drum, which sent electricity into the toxic water. He flipped the switch, sending electrical charges flying across the green liquid and Robin\u2019s body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBatman! HELP!\u201d Robin screamed as he felt the toxic chemicals go through his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was about to run away when a batarang flew through the air! It circled around him, wrapping his arms and legs in strong, metal cords. Finally, Batman ran up to the drum and shut off the power to the pool of green liquid. Unfortunately, Robin was already underwater for the second time. Batman fired a batarang which hooked on to Robin\u2019s body, allowing Batman to pull his sidekick out of the green, murky water as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman hoisted Robin\u2019s body over his shoulder before he carried him to the bat mobile. From there, he took the Boy Wonder to the Bat cave as quickly as possible\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Medcom was the medical computer, which was programmed to analyze any type of medical condition that Batman or Robin might have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh Batman\u2026 I feel awful! I got a splitting headache! And that green gooey stuff that I fell into! That stuff smelled awful! Then I got zapped with electricity! Urrgg!\u201d Robin groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman leaned over as he read the text on the computer screen, following a careful diagnosis of Robin\u2019s body following his plunge into the drum at the research lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour body has absorbed some sort of toxic chemical. The computer analyzed it as a plant growth stimulant. Furthermore, the electrical charges combined with the toxic chemical have altered your DNA somehow\u2026\u201d Batman remarked as he read the results on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 What does that mean? I\u2019m turning into a plant? Or am I going to grow seeds?\u201d Robin chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure! But\u2026 Let\u2019s just keep an eye on you, okay? Why don\u2019t you get cleaned up! Go enjoy a nice, long, hot bath and then crawl in bed!\u201d Batman suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger that, Batman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Boy Wonder then jumped off the table and then ran into the locker room at the end of the batcave where he quickly removed his colorful costume and yellow cape. He tossed his dirty costume in a laundry bin, next to a closet with a dozen other Robin-costumes which he had, ready to be worn at a moment\u2019s notice. From there, he ran upstairs into the house through a secret, trap door under the stairwell, which only he and Batman knew about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was upstairs, he emerged as the former acrobat and student of criminology and martial arts, Dick Grayson went into his bathroom and filled his tub with warm water. He got in and sat in his tub for thirty minutes, enjoying the peace and quiet while allowing the sticky, dirty, green goo to get off his skin. About thirty minutes later, he got up and used soap and a wash cloth to clean himself and to rinse his body thoroughly. Dick came out of the top and dried off. He put on a short and t-shirt before he quietly went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick slept like a log all through the night, unaware that the strange toxic chemicals were at work deep inside of his body. He was completely unaware that he was about to experience the first effects of his exposure to this weird combination of toxic chemicals mixed with electricity, which were sent through his body as he was immersed in a drum filled with this stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the first sparks of light came shining through the curtains in his bedroom, Dick groggily turned around on his bed and stared at the small, digital clock on his dresser. He was usually the first person awake, since he was so used to getting up early in order to go to school in the morning. Luckily for him, this was a Sunday morning, and he really didn\u2019t have to wake up early for any reason other than the fact that he wanted to get up to go for a walk outside. He turned on the light in his room and then he looked around his dresser for some shorts and a thin cotton t-shirt to wear so he could put on something comfortable to wear outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally put on his running shoes before he walked to the front door, carefully unlocking the door and slipping outside. He then started on his light jog around the neighborhood, so he could enjoy the sights and sounds of the birds and the dogs barking and a few of his neighbors also walking around and greeting one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had completed a short run around the block, he got back into Wayne Manor, he closed and locked the front door behind him and he went into the kitchen to get a glass of cold water to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce Wayne had just got up and he was sitting in the living room, reading the newspaper while Dick Grayson was standing in the kitchen pouring him a glass of water, when Dick was suddenly overcome by an odd, tingling sensation. It struck him very sudden, causing him to close his eyes and tilt his head backwards for a brief moment while he let out a soft groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick\u2019s calf muscles on the back of his legs suddenly began to swell, like his muscles were growing! They inflated rapidly like helium balloons, gaining more muscle and definition with every passing second! They pushed outward and sideways, growing from thin muscles into thick, hard and round spheres of muscle, bulging out from the back of his legs, until they were as big as softballs\u2026 All within a matter of seconds! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, his quadriceps, those thick muscles on his legs, just above the knees, started to expand and thicken at the same time. They hardened and grew wider for a few seconds, like they had been used in a grueling workout! Dick had no idea what was happening to him, as his legs grew thicker and more muscular over a period of ten seconds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the growth spurt stopped, and Dick lowered his head again, panting and sweating for a moment, feeling as if he had just experienced an intense workout. What had just happened to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe casually walked into the living room, where Bruce was sitting in his chair, reading the newspaper. When Bruce looked up, he noticed something different about his companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, good morning, Bruce!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you go for your usual run around the block?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! I went around the block twice already!\u201d Dick responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026 I can tell. You\u2019re all sweaty! You must have had a good workout!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick just shrugged. He smiled in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you been working out your legs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy legs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour legs! You look like you\u2019ve gained some muscle! Or, am I seeing things?\u201d Bruce remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Dick wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey seem a little bigger!\u201d Bruce said. \u201cLet\u2019s go check you out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce and Dick went downstairs into the batcave where Bruce had the Medcom do another quick scan of Dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just gained six pounds! Overnight!\u201d Bruce noted. \u201cSix pounds\u2026 of muscle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? But\u2026 all I did was run around the block! That\u2019s crazy!\u201d Dick replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see if you grow some more!\u201d Bruce said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the alarm went off. The bat signal! The notice flashed on the computer! There was a bank robbery in Gotham City!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShowtime!\u201d Bruce said, as the two men quickly changed into Batman and Robin, before they leaped into the Bat mobile and raced off to the bank in order to stop a robbery from happening\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They quickly ran up to the tellers and asked them to open their registers and to empty all their cash in the plastic bags, while the other robbers had ordered all the customers and tellers to lay on the floor with their hands behind their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon! Hurry it up! We ain\u2019t got all day!\u201d one robber sneered at the tellers, who were very nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the robbers, one of the tellers had stepped on a secret tile on the floor, which had triggered a silent alarm, which went off in the police station. From there, the Commissioner had activated the bat signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon! Gimme the bags\u2026. Let\u2019s go-go-go!\u201d the impatient robber shouted at the tellers as he snatched the bags, filled with money, out of the hands of the trembling bank employees\u2019 hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a shame! We just wanted to make a deposit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robbers turned around and were greeted by two caped men, standing in the middle of the bank lobby.  Batman and Robin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first robber was about to shoot his gun, when it was snatched out of his hand by a batarang! When he bent down to pick up his weapon, he was greeted by a strong first in his jaw!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Robin swung a rope from his utility belt to the beam below the ceiling, and then he leaped into the air, swinging three feet above the ground as he headed towards two other robbers, kicking them in their stomachs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOFFF!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he landed on his feet, Robin engaged in a fistfight with both of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! BAM! BOMM!! BIFF!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman knocked out the first robber before he used a special spray to render the second one unconscious. Then he swung the batarang at the third robber, who was fighting Robin, allowing the batarang to encircle the robber until the thug was completely tied up with a steel cable, and unable to move his arms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin threw three more punches using all his strength to knock out the last robber, when he finally decided to use his stronger legs, leaping in the air and kicking the man in his head. This sent the men tumbling to the ground, knocked out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! Those new leg-muscles help a lot!\u201d Robin grinned, looking down at his inflated legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Dynamic Duo heard police sirens approaching from a distance. They dashed out the front door, leaped into the Bat-mobile, and raced off to the bat cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Batman and Robin returned to their hideout, where they discussed the events which took place in the bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had some impressive strength-moves in the bank just now, Robin!\u201d Batman said to his apprentice. \u201cI had never seen you leap so high in the air before!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I could feel the strength in my legs! I guess that was the result of that weird growth spurt I had earlier?\u201d Robin wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! But, I wonder if you\u2019ll have more of them\u2026\u201d Batman thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have no idea when it\u2026 Uhh\u2026\u201d Robin replied, when he closed his eyes and cringed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Robin! What\u2019s the matter?\u201d Batman remarked as he rushed towards his sidekick. He realized that there was something wrong with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin tilted his head back. Then he made fists, tensing his muscles in his arms. He took a deep breath before letting out a soft growl, when suddenly Batman could hear a bone-cracking noise coming from within Robin\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKKKKKKKKRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin\u2019s chest suddenly pushed outward! His pectorals practically ballooned right before Batman\u2019s eyes! The Caped Crusader just stared on, completely slack-jawed in amazement, as he watched Robin\u2019s bright red uniform get tighter and tighter, to the point where the yellow strings on the front of the shirt of his uniform started to rip apart as Robin\u2019s bulging chest muscles started to push apart his shirt! Not only that, but Robin\u2019s arms were bulging as well. Specifically, his biceps and his triceps were inflating and expanding, to the point where they were tearing apart the sleeves of his green shirt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACKKKK! RRIPPPP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin\u2019s mighty, bulging pectorals had pushed out from his chest by at least eight inches, leaving a deep cleavage between the two halves of his chest! His biceps were as round as melons! It was amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh! Batman! What\u2026 What just happened to me?\u201d Robin gasped, like he had just come out of a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just had another growth spurt, my friend! You need a bigger costume!\u201d Batman smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin quickly removed his torn shirt, before examining his body in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly Hercules, Batman! I\u2019m all big and buff now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stood in the bathroom, examining his big, bulging chest and his large, round biceps. Boy, was he STRONG! He could feel the strength!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll use the computer to create a new costume for you! That will fit you, until your next growth spurt\u2026 Whenever that comes!\u201d Batman suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Batman, Robin\u2019s next growth spurt was just around the corner!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was in the tub for barely ten minutes, when Bruce knocked on the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Remember your appointment at the youth club, right?\u201d Bruce said, as he just opened the door enough so Dick could hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe youth club?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Robin\u2019s supposed to show up there at five to meet a group of kids and to talk about fighting crime!\u201d Bruce Wayne reminded the teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh! I almost forgot about that!\u201d Dick replied. \u201cI\u2019m gonna need a bigger costume for that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make you a bigger vest and shirt! Don\u2019t worry! I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll outgrow this one right away!\u201d Bruce assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Bruce went down to the Batcave where he instructed the computer to create a new costume for Robin, but one size larger, in order to cover Dick\u2019s increased muscular body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Dick came down to the Batcave, wearing just his bathrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, now put this on and see how it fits!\u201d Bruce instructed the muscular boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green shirt was comfortable but tight. The red vest fit nice and snug, but the yellow laces tied it up, making the red vest fit nice and tight around Dick\u2019s torso and his big, bulging chest. The sleeves of the green shirt were much bigger, showing his much bigger biceps as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m not gonna outgrow this costume today! At the rate I\u2019m growing these days\u2026\u201d Dick mumbled, as he placed the black mask over his face, completing his Robin costume, except for the yellow utility belt and the green shoes. \u201cYou may need to create an even bigger costume for me by tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens! Your increased strength and size might come in handy some day!\u201d Bruce remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Robin got on his motorcycle and started the engine. A secret door opened, and the Boy Wonder rode off and headed towards the youth center, where he arrived ten minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the kids gawked and glanced at the much larger Boy Wonder, who certainly looked bigger, taller, and definitely more muscular than they had remembered seeing him on TV or even on the colorful poster of Batman and Robin, which was hanging on the wall in front of the classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClassroom\u2026 This is Robin! He\u2019s here to talk about safety and how to be safe everywhere you go! Give him a big round of applause!\u201d Mrs. Wilson said, as the kids in the room stood up and applauded as Robin came forward to the front of the small classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello everyone! My name is Robin and I\u2019m here to talk about child safety!\u201d Robin began, leading in to his 10-minute speech about being safe and secure. He talked about being vigilant, not talking to strangers, never walking outside all alone, and locking all doors and windows of the house at night or when home alone. He also talked about what to do when there was a fire, or if a child was in a car accident with an adult, and how to call 9-1-1 and what to say in case of an emergency. Finally, in the end, Robin allowed time for questions where kids could come up to him and greet him or shake his hand or even get his autograph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA curious boy, about ten years old, stood up with a big smile on his face. He walked up to Robin and shook his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! How did your muscles get so big? You don\u2019t look that big on the posters!\u201d the boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Umm\u2026. Well\u2026 I just recently grew bigger\u2026\u201d Robin stuttered a bit, not knowing how to explain his amazing growth spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother girl raised her hand and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I feel your big muscles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Robin blush a bit. He loved being with the kids and there was no reason to say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 Sure\u2026\u201d Robin shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t see why not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl asked Robin to squat down, which he did. She then felt his biceps with her hand, by placing her thin, small fingers over his big, bulging muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Your muscles are so big and hard!\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin then stood up straight, only allowing her to reach his legs now. The boy and the girl then walked around the mighty hero, admiring the huge, muscle-bound youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanna feel his leg-muscles!\u201d the boy said to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl got behind Robin and gently started rubbing Robin\u2019s calf muscle on his left leg, while the boy started rubbing his calf muscle on his right leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was too busy to answer question from other kids to say anything, although he did feel the kids\u2019 hands rubbing up against his calves, when he was suddenly overcome by the weird, tingling sensation which had struck him every time he had a growth spurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh man\u2026. Not again!\u201d Robin groaned, as he let out a soft moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d the little girl, who was rubbing Robin\u2019s leg said. \u201cI think his legs are growing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! We made his muscles grow even bigger!\u201d the little boy exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kids, along with all the other kids in the room, let out a collective gasp when they saw their hero experience a tremendous muscle growth spurt, in their classroom, right before their eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only did Robin\u2019s muscles grow bigger, but Robin grew about four inches taller as well! His legs stretched out, growing longer in the process! His arms followed suit and his torso a little bit as well. His calf muscles then expanded by another three inches, becoming bigger, harder and firmer, right before the eyes of the two little kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin\u2019s big chest expanded even more, now filling out his larger costume to the point where that was very tight! His pectorals bulged sideways and forward, while his biceps and triceps filled out a few inches more. Mighty delts and lats completed the broad shoulders on the bigger boy, followed by massive abdominal muscles and shocking quads on his legs which sported thick layers of muscle, covered by long, rope-like veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was now becoming more of a teenage bodybuilder, as the kids looked on with delight and glee, enjoying the transformation before their very eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was sooooo cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Did you see THAT?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! Robin just hulked out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobin just grew even bigger\u2026. Just for us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanna see him do that again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Make him grow again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was just able to catch his breath, realizing that he had just experienced another growth spurt! He felt bigger, taller, heavier and a LOT stronger! He noticed that he had become taller, his center of gravity had changed, and his costume was killing him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 What happened? Holy muscles!\u201d he exclaimed, when the teacher came before him and the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay class! Let\u2019s all thank Mr. Robin for coming!\u201d Mrs. Wilson said, as all the kids applauded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Robin walked out and headed to the parking lot, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder what the kids must have been thinking, seeing him grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hopped on the motorcycle and quickly raced back to the batcave, where he figured he would have an interesting story to tell Bruce. Not just that, but while he was riding, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder. Was the growth spurt just pure coincidence, or was it perhaps triggered by something the kids had done to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The word got out on the street about the strange but peculiar method of causing Robin\u2019s muscles to grow bigger and by causing the Boy Wonder\u2019s body to grow taller\u2026 all at the same time! The fascinated children who were witnesses to the strange growth spurt of their unsuspecting hero told all their friends and relatives and neighbors about the strange growth spurt\u2026 Just by rubbing Robin\u2019s calf muscles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news anchors of the nightly news show even started discussing the weird rumor that had been making the rounds, having one of the kids over during a live interview. Was it true? Rubbing Robin\u2019s legs caused him to grow several inches taller, and made his muscles grow bigger? How was that even possible? But there were just too many kids around who were telling the same story to their parents and friends for this to be discounted as a coincidence. Unfortunately, several criminals had heard the news as well and had wondered if this rumor was true or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at this point in time, they had no time to think about making Robin grow. They were going to drive two vans to the location of an art show in order to steal a large collection of valuable artwork!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe art exhibit had already closed and the visitors had left the building. One security guard had stayed behind to guard the building on the inside and on the outside; taking turns walking around the building while the place was closed and locked for the night. As the night time ticked away, the two vans pulled up in the back parking lot of the art gallery and they parked next to each other. Then the four men got out wearing ski masks and they made their way to the back entrance of the building. They used a stolen key to unlock the door, which had set off a silent alarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men then got in and used flashlights to guide them as they wandered the dark hallways until they reached the small exhibition hall. From there, they quickly took turns and removed the paintings from the walls and placed them in large leather bags, which they were carrying with them. Once the paintings were all collected and stored inside of the large leather bags, they quietly walked out of the building and headed towards the parked vans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the robbers there ran into the security guard, who sounded the alarm as he realized that the art exhibition hall was in the process of being robbed! The masked robber then removed a spray can from his pocket and sprayed a sleeping spray on the guard, knocking him unconscious almost instantly. The guard then fell to the floor as the robbers quickly loaded the painting into the back of the vans before they started the vans and began to drive off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had the vans left the art exhibit building or the robbers realized that they were being followed! One van was being chased by nothing other than the famous Batmobile while the other van was being chased by a motorcycle containing a slightly taller and more muscular version of Robin, the Boy Wonder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Batman continued his chase and kept up on the first van, Robin was struggling to keep up with the van since he was on a motorcycle which wasn\u2019t able to go as fast as the van. So, he realized that he had to do something to get up to speed with the runaway van very soon or else he would lose them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin finally decided to unclip a batarang from his utility belt and to toss it at the ladder which was attached to the back metal door of the runaway van, which was driving at high speed in front of him. The batarang quickly latched on to the edge of the ladder, and when Robin felt confident that the batarang wouldn\u2019t come loose, he increased the speed on his bike until he was going at maximum speed, to the point where he leaped from the seat of his motorcycle and soared through the air until he landed with his hands against the steps of the ladder. From there, he climbed up to the top of the van, where he held onto the metal roof while the van was still being driven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the drivers of the van realized that the Boy Wonder was no longer following them, he decided to slow down, not realizing that the enemy was actually riding on top of his van!  The driver then drove to the secret hideout where the other van was to meet, none of them knowing that Batman was following the second van from a distance in order to not be detected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth vans drove into a large, indoor garage, where a large sliding door closed shut. The men then opened the back doors to the vans and began to unload the stolen artwork from the vans, when suddenly a short, fat man came walking into the garage. The man wore a black top hat with a black vest and nice black dress shoes and a bow tie with a cigar in his mouth. It was the Penguin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay you bungling birdbrains! You got all the paintings?\u201d Penguin sneered at the four masked men. \u201cThese will earn me a pretty penny on the black market! Hahahaha!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis statement greatly angered Robin who was listening in while he was still lying flat down on the roof of the van. He couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer and decided to get up and leap down from the roof of the van, right before the Penguin and the four thugs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be getting ANY money for those paintings, Penguin! Those paintings were stolen and you know it! Those paintings will be returned to the art gallery and you guys will be tossed in jail!\u201d Robin shouted at the five of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Penguin shouted at the Boy Wonder. \u201cYou\u2019re here all alone, and we\u2019re here with the five of us! We can still beat you, even though you look bigger than you were before! Let\u2019s get him, boys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was able to put up a remarkable fight considering that he was all by himself and fighting against five people, all by himself. Thanks to his increased size, standing about six feet tall, and his increased muscles, he was able to knock out the first thug with just two punches. Then, he used his legs and a few karate moves to knock out the second guy. Then, he spun around, and used his legs to kick both of the remaining two guys at the same time. He started punching both guys, one by one, when the Penguin suddenly walked up to Robin and sprayed Robin in the face with a spray which rendered him unconscious. The Boy Wonder quickly tumbled to the ground, leaving the four wounded thugs licking their wounds for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDarn that kid hurt us!\u201d one of the masked thugs was complaining as he put bandages on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you four fools take care of Robin before he wakes up? Wrap him up in a rope or something before he wakes up and beats all four of you guys! Idiots! Why does it take little old me to bring him down when he was about to punch out all four of you? Morons!\u201d the Penguin growled as he turned around and marched back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four guys found a thin rope and tied it around Robin\u2019s arms and legs, as they laid him down on the floor. A few minutes later, the boy woke up again. The men helped the boy get on his feet, so he was standing in the corner. Then, they tied him up so he was tied with his back against a metal pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou jerks won\u2019t get away with this! The police will come looking for me and those paintings! Then you\u2019ll all be tossed in jail for a very long time!\u201d Robin shouted at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guys, named Jerry, then turned and walked towards the Boy Wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better hush there, boy. You talk tough but you\u2019re not that big and tough!\u201d the bigger man said to Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure!\u201d another man named Karl said to him. \u201cI heard something on the news that it was really easy to make him grow bigger and stronger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on!\u201d Jerry laughed. \u201cSomeone only grows stronger by spending years in the gym, lifting weights and doing exercises! It takes hours and hours of long and hard work!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this rumor is going around\u201d Karl explained, \u201cThat just by rubbing Robin\u2019s calves; he will grow bigger and more muscular!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen! That\u2019s just a rumor and I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d Jerry replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that true?\u201d Karl asked Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d Robin shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh come on! Nobody grows that easily! I\u2019ll prove it!\u201d Jerry growled as he got up from his chair and walked over to Robin was standing as he was tied to the metal pole by a rope. The man then walked to the back of Robin\u2019s body and there he squatted down. He reached over with both arms and he began running his fingers over Robin\u2019s calves, just below his knees on the back of his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! You\u2019re pretty muscular, kid! You must work out a lot! So how did you get so big?\u201d Jerry asked Robin, as he continued to rub his calf muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His pecs grew like huge muscles, filling out his red and green shirt until his uniform began to rip in half! Then, his sleeves tore in half, due to the amazing muscle in his arms! His shoulders expanded in every direction, growing sideways and in the width, with veins covering every layer of muscle which was fighting to grow out from his expanding body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis massive calves were ballooning out from his amazing legs and growing like huge footballs implanted in his legs. They just inflated and swelled like there was no end, becoming harder and bigger like anything ever seen! His quadriceps just grew thicker and wider and deeper at the same time, with multiple layers of veins coming to the surface as well, covering the mighty muscles all over the place, from his knees all the way up to his groin! His legs were becoming thicker than sewer pipes, exploding with powerful muscles which were making his legs look like rockets!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only were Robin\u2019s muscles getting bigger, but he was growing taller as well! All these muscles were causing the boy to grow by another foot, rising up and expanding to almost a staggering height of 7 feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Robin was becoming so big, that his growing and expanding body was pressing up against the rope that was trying to contain him. However, the growing muscles were fighting a winning battle, and Robin\u2019s expanding muscles finally won the fight! The rope snapped and fell to the floor, freeing the Boy Wonder as he was still growing bigger and more muscular!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman was hiding in the air duct above the room and saw that Robin had grown and became free during his growth spurt! So, he used his tools to cut a hole in the air duct and swung to the ground below, just as Robin woke up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened? Batman! Hey, I\u2019m free!\u201d Robin gasped, as he realized that he had grown just as Batman had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! Get them!\u201d Karl shouted, as Jerry, Dave and Paul arrived. All four thugs were in the fight, but against two heroes, including a much bigger and stronger version of Robin!<br>\r\nBatman had his hands full with Dave, the biggest thug of them all. In the meantime, Robin was busy fighting the other three men, and it was an easy fight! Robin so overpowered these men by punching them out using overwhelming strength and power, plus his intimidating size. Robin was now taller and bigger than Batman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when the Penguin arrived, Robin leaped over him and punched him out. Batman and Robin then alerted the police and they collected the stolen paintings. Lastly, Batman got into the Batmobile and raced home. Robin, who was too big to sit in the Batmobile, he just ran home, using his superhuman strength and speed. He leaped over buildings and reached the Batcave in almost the same amount of time as it took Batman to drive home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back in the Batcave, the subject of a bigger costume for the 7-foot-tall, 350-pound, super-muscular Robin came up again! Not only that, but Batman had to make Robin grow until the toxic chemicals in the Boy Wonder\u2019s body were worn off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was: How big would his final growth spurt be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cBatman! How much more will I keep on growing?\u201d the large, towering Boy Wonder asked the Caped Crusader. Somehow, it felt very strange for Robin to be taller than Batman. He was so used to looking up to Batman, that it seemed weird to him, now that he was towering over his masked hero by almost a foot in height!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Robin, we need to force you to grow until the growth chemical has worn out in your body! Now, let\u2019s get you hooked up to Medcom one more time and do a body scan and see if we can get a reading!\u201d Batman suggested to the big, tall boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin walked over to the large medical computer called Medcom, where he took several wires with suction cups and attached them to his chest, his arms and his legs. Batman flipped several switches and waited for the computer to analyze the scan of Robin\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it seems like the chemical presence has only been reduced by 36 percent, so about 64 percent is remaining! That means you will have just one more significant growth spurt and then it\u2019ll be over!\u201d Batman explained. \u201cSo, we need to trigger a growth spurt in you and force you to grow until you can\u2019t grow anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I may as well get it over with!\u201d Robin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Take off your costume, since you\u2019ll outgrow this for sure. We have no idea how big you\u2019ll get after this is over!\u201d Batman ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin removed his mask, his gloves, his shirt and his shoes, along with his long, yellow cape. He only kept on his stretchy green briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Batman and Robin walked over to the largest area in the Batcave, which had over 50-foot ceilings. It was a large room with big doors and high ceilings. This was the lab where batman kept scientific and computer equipment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Robin\u2026\u201d Batman said, while holding a long feather from some bird in his hand. \u201cThis will tickle a bit, but this should make you grow like crazy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin closed his eyes as Batman walked behind the boy and squatted down, rubbing the tip of the feather against the boy\u2019s bulging calf muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhmmm\u2026 That tickles like crazy!\u201d Robin exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman held a feather in each hand, and tickled both of Robin big, monster calf muscles at the same time, on both of his thick, muscular legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooohhhhhhh\u2026. Batman\u2026. I\u2026 feel\u2026 it\u2026\u201d Robin groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his loud groaning was followed by that familiar bone-cracking sound, which came from deep within Robin\u2019s body. Only this time, since his body was much bigger than before, the sound was louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKKKKKKKKKKRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Batman kept on rubbing the tips of the feathers against Robin\u2019s calves, he noticed suddenly that the boy\u2019s legs started to GROW! Batman had to stand up now, because Robin\u2019s legs started growing longer and even MORE muscular than before, and at an alarming rate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis calf muscles were totally EXPLODING with muscle! They practically came alive and started to swell up to giant proportions, filling out to mega-balloons! They grew larger than medicine-balls, becoming rock-hard and bigger and rounder than ever! Surely they would allow Robin to leap over tall buildings by now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow only did his calves grow, but his quadriceps as well! They swelled up into enormous, thick columns of large, wide and hard pillars of muscle-steel. Thick layers of veins surfaced all over them, as they grew into the biggest quads anyone had ever seen on earth! Every cyclist or runner on earth would be jealous of Robin now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin\u2019s legs continued to grow bigger and longer, making the boy grow bigger and TALLER! He was now standing 8 feet tall\u2026 9 feet tall\u2026 10 feet tall! Batman had to crane his neck and just stared in disbelief as he saw his partner become more of a giant, right before his very eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut other things were happening to Robin as well. His torso was growing bigger, wider, taller and longer at the same time. His mighty abdominal muscles were growing even bigger and his pectorals were jutting out from his chest by over 3 feet. He was truly a giant muscle man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis biceps and triceps were bigger than soccer balls and his arms were much bigger than anything ever seen on earth! His hands and feet were gigantic now, as the boy surpassed 13 feet in height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman had to stop rubbing Robin\u2019s legs with the feathers just because he couldn\u2019t reach his calves anymore! His legs were now bigger than Batman\u2019s entire body! Robin was now twice as tall as Batman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKKKKRRRRRRRR\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a final, great growth spurt which propelled Robin to his final height before his growth spurt stopped, leaving the giant boy panting heavily for a moment as he looked down at his diminutive partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my\u2026 My gosh\u2026. I\u2026 Wow\u2026\u201d Robin gasped, as he tried to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one more thing happened. Two stumps began to emerge from Robin\u2019s torso, on either side, right below his arms. The stumps were about as big as his arms. Then, they began to grow rapidly, until they formed elbows. Finally, they grew even longer, forming wrists and then hands with fingers at the ends of them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBatman! Look! I just grew a second set of arms!\u201d Robin gasped, as he moved his second set of arms around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly smoke!\u201d Batman exclaimed.  Robin had four arms, two on each side! He now had four hands, and twenty fingers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just experienced a mutation, thanks to the chemicals!\u201d Batman grinned. \u201cThe chemical was a plant growing chemical, and it caused you to grow a new set of arms!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin now stood 18 feet tall, so about 3 times taller than Batman! In fact, Batman just reached past his knees and came up to his quads. Batman could easily walk under Robin\u2019s legs now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh, Batman! What am I gonna do? I\u2019m so BIG!\u201d Robin sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine! Let\u2019s create a new, large costume for you! You\u2019re so strong, that you can leap to anywhere in Gotham City! You can run faster and you can jump higher! You\u2019ll be very useful to me! So, don\u2019t worry about it!\u201d Batman said to his gigantic partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, an alarm sounded. The computer lit up! There was a robbery at a jewelry store! The robbers fled in a van and they escaped to\u2026 the chemical lab at the university!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! Not again! They\u2019re at that lab! That\u2019s where that big metal drum is with that green chemical that caused me to grow in the first place!\u201d Robin groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem! Just don\u2019t fall in that drum this time!\u201d Batman said. \u201cMeet you there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman leaped in the Batmobile and raced over to the lab while Robin ran over the street and leaped over the rooftops of the buildings, using his mighty leg muscles. Within minutes they arrived there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin walked around the large lab when he heard a noise. Then he spotted a man running down a metal bridge which was suspended over the lab site! Robin climbed a ladder and reached a platform. From there, he ran over the metal bridge, and he almost caught up to the man who was carrying a bag containing the stolen jewelry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the man grabbed a bottle of cleaning solution, which was standing on a shelf, and poured it all over the walkway of the bridge just as the big, towering Boy Wonder was running towards him. This caused Robin to slip, and the giant boy fell over the railing and tumbled into the big metal containing below!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot again!\u201d Batman gasped, as he saw his giant friend fall into the same green liquid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparks flew as the giant metal container lit up with electrical currency, sending volts of power through the green goo and through Robin\u2019s body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman threw a batarang at the robber and tied him up. Then, he tossed one at Robin, who was swimming in the chemicals! Robin grabbed hold of the cable and managed to climb out, but it wasn\u2019t after he had spent about ten minutes swimming and soaking in the chemicals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go again!\u201d Batman sighed. \u201cRobin\u2019s gonna grow even bigger now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Robin got out, he was soaking wet. He stared at Batman, who looked up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet back to the Batcave, if you can fit through the door\u2026\u201d Batman grinned. \u201cWait for me there, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman got in the Batmobile as the police arrived. The robber was captured, and Batman was on his way home, wondering how big Robin would be once he got there\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Robin arrived at the Batcave, he rushed to the largest room in the cave, which luckily had a very high ceiling which was over 100 feet above the ground. For the time being it was high enough, although Robin began to wonder how much longer it would take before he would become that tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Boy Wonder quickly removed his soaked costume before taking a long hot shower, trying desperately to remove as much of the green goo as possible, although it was already too late. Most of the green chemical had already penetrated his skin, which made him feel very nervous. This was the same chemical which made him grow several weeks earlier, and the results were amazing. Robin grew from a normal-sized guy into this gigantic super-muscular man with four arms and giant muscles. Not only did he now have four arms and four hands, along with twenty fingers, but he was over eighteen feet tall as well! He was three times as big as Batman! The Caped Crusader would now reach halfway up to his quadriceps when they talked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat worried Robin even more was the fact that the green goo at the lab had penetrated his leg! And his legs were already long to begin with! None of the chemical was to be found anymore, so it had all entered his body! It was already circulating inside of him, building up energy for his next growth spurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin had washed himself thoroughly when he got out of the giant shower, which had been modified for his increased size. When he got out and grabbed a large towel, so he could dry himself off, he was overcome by a weird, tingling sensation. He froze in place for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! Here it comes!\u201d he gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly ran over to the large mirror, which hung against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was expecting to see his muscles expand some more, as he moved his four thick, long muscular arms around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something else happened instead. His torso widened. It seemed as if his chest and stomach grew wider. His legs grew farther apart, widening the gap between them. Robin could only look at his reflection in the mirror, showing his naked but very muscular, giant body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it seemed like his body had widened considerably, it appeared as if there was enough room between his legs for\u2026 Two more legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What\u2026 What\u2019s happening to me?\u201d Robin wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, two stumps began to grow from his groin, exactly between his two existing legs, which had become separated by a noticeable gap. The two stumps were exactly as wide and as thick as two new legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stumps grew longer and thicker, coming down past his existing outer legs, forming knees at the half-way point. Then, they grew even further, forming a new set of quads and a new set of calves on each leg, until they reached the end. Then, they formed the ankles, the feet, and new sets of toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the growth stopped, Robin couldn\u2019t believe what he saw. He now had four legs! He had two left feet and two right feet! His dual set of legs now matched his dual set of arms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly smoke! I got a left foot, a right foot, and another left foot and another right foot! I got four feet attached to four legs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Batman arrived, and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobin! Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! You won\u2019t believe this, Batman! I got four legs! I\u2019m a total freak!\u201d Robin shouted back. \u201cYou need to change my costume again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin put on his shirt and walked out, holding a towel around his waist. Obviously, Batman needed to create a new brief for Robin, wide enough, and with four holes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He sighed as he saw a note from Bruce. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n~GONE TO A BOARD MEETING~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and got dressed into tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt. He headed downstairs. Alfred had a week off, visiting family. He made himself breakfast, and tuck in hungrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished his breakfast, and headed home over to the kitchen counter. He took out a protein shake from the fridge, and proceeded to start to drink it. He finished it quickly, and headed to the home gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in the gym when he felt a tingling sensation in his calves. He planted his feet firmly, and his calves began to grow. Slowly but surely, inch by inch. He moaned as thick, defined muscle piled itself onto his lower legs. The muscle now protruded out the back of his legs massively, stretching his tracksuit bottoms to the limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth moved up his legs to his quadriceps. The already defined muscle began to expand, layers and layers of hard muscle piling on. There was a loud tearing sound as the muscle ripped through his tracksuit, turning them into shorts that rode up above his quads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tilted his head back and moaned loudly as the muscle on his firm ass began to balloon out. It kept going and going until it tore through his shorts, making them shred. It revealed a ridiculously stretched pair of boxer shorts. The shorts were stretched out the back, and the front began to fill as well as two massive cords of muscle ran down his stomach in a V, filling the waistband of the shorts to breaking limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a tingle in his upper stomach, and moaned as a line appeared down his stomach. The small bit of fat melted away, revealing this line straight down. At the top, just below his chest, two cinder blocks emerged from his stomach. Another row emerged below it, and another, and another. He stared in awe at his brand new 8 pack abs, which were straining so hard that he could see them through his t-shirt. His obliques also pushed out, stretching the fabric to breaking point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis small pecs began to expand,bigger and bigger.they swelled in every direction,out to his arms and up to his neck. When they filled that space,they began to grow outwards. He laughed as they tore through his shirt, and kept going, big, rock hard mounds of muscle, separated by a deep line. His lats flared out to perfectly frame them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a creaking noise as his back widened. Large, ripped pockets of muscle swelled across it, tearing through his t-shirt. His traps expanded, and his neck thickened greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands started to grow, becoming heavier. The growth moved up his forearms as they swelled into thick,sinewy muscle. He gasped as his biceps and triceps expanded as well, nearing 20\". He flexed them both, as his shoulders grew wider and wider apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, his now massive body decided to put the young boy through puberty all at once. His small testicles swelled to the size of soft balls, and began to manufacture massive amounts of testosterone. This caused his penis to elongate so much that it burst through his pants.</span></div></div>",
