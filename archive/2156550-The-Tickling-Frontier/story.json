You are beautiful yet have a charismatic gaze. Your long brunette hair and sharp nose is also an eye catcher to your many fans and supporters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour secretary, Alison, walks into your office and hands you two pieces of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady, our first objective is to choose a side. Will you go to the big corporations and accept their money? Or will you go around town and talk with the citizens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at both files and contemplate your choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the positives and negatives of both?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you will potentially have more money is you choose the big corporations and they are very powerful. However, you basically answer to them. And while that may not seem like a big deal, there have been...rumors about them taking advantage of other powerful politicians for...personal reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personal Reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well....of course, these are just rumors, but word is the big corporations have their own secret club where they enjoy making both powerful and weak women their...umm...play thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...okay......what about the mom and pop shops?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will have a much harder time pleasing the citizens because they all want different things. And you might not make enough money for your campaign. Plus, you'll have to face another candidate that has the backup of the big corporations. But, show the citizens you care about making them happy because at the end of the day, it's not their money that will you make you the leader. It's their votes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about both, and now, it's time to make a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. For my campaign, I will rely on:\"</span></div></div>",

Her condition was to come alone and shoot whatever video she wanted you to do. Despite being a bit suspicious of this request, politics was politics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived at the building in your business attire which consists of a tux with a business skirt. You also had a skin colored stocking with high heels on. You approached the secretary at the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HI, I'm Elise. I'm here for a meeting with Chelsea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, take the elevator to the top floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank her and head to the elevator. You arrived at the top floor in a huge area where there really wasn't much besides a desk and a few couches. Chelsea looks up at you and smiles. Chelsea was an older women with orange hair in curls. You are 5 feet 8 inches tall and she's around 5 feet 2 inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Elise. Come sit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down and opened the files you had with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So as you know, I come in to ask for your support to be the leader of this Frontier. These are the plans that I believe can help us for the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and looks at the files for about 5 seconds before closing the folder and looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, I'm sure you can do what's best for us. But what I wanted was not your plans...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted me to...do a video of some sort?\" You asked raising an eyebrow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and gets up, placing her hands behind her back. She hums and walks behind you, then puts her hands on your shoulders, giving you a massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, as you know, I'm getting older. While I still am beautiful, others might not agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, well, I think you're still-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush. I don't need your pity. Now, I've watched you since the beginning and I love how STRONG and charismatic you are...which makes me want to support you. That being said, I am an older women who's really horny so here's my offer. Be in a video where I tickle you, and I say something like \"Look folks, she's willing to take the torture for YOU people.\" To make yourself look good. Or, we don't have to make it public. I will still sponsor you, but you will be recorded and this file will be kept in case you ever disobey me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip.

There was a bad and various of tools as well as video cameras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, all you need to do is react. Let me do all the talking...Well, you can improvise if you want.

But of course, our enemy isn't only going to tickle you for 5 seconds, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that your shirt is undressed, the only thing covering your upper body is your bra. She moves her fingers to your armpits. While you still were able to hold in your laughter, the non stop tickle assault on your armpits became too much after just 5 more seconds of tickling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try squeezing your chin to your neck and your arms to cover your armpit, but to no avail as laughter finally escaped. It was super loud and filled up the room as the squeezing turned into twisting and turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally stopped and you opened your eyes to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're enjoying this, young one. You want me to unhook your bra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what it was, but the way she's able to carry herself really turned you on. She knew how to touch you, how to tickle you, how to tease you. How to make you feel sexy and wanted. She asked you a question, and now you must answer.</span></div></div>",

No words were needed, you both knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now folks, for our last act, we all know that our enemies do not resort to just tickling, they take advantage of our women hood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts playing with your nipples as well as your groin, giving you occasional tickles in between. There were times when you wanted to moan, but it seemed like Chelsea knew it would happen so she would give you a squeeze to the sides. While you were not able to focus, you were aware of your surroundings. You became embarrassed as you remember the two other ladies in the room with the cameras. One got close to your bright red face as you instinctively turned away. While they didn't say anything, it was the energy in the room you can sense that they enjoyed seeing a powerful women reduce to a squirming mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut luckily, Chelsea did stop the tickling and the teasing as she got off you. She went to the drawers and took out a hairbrush and went over to your feet. She quickly scrubbed up and down your feet. You screamed loud and pulled your feet back as hard you can. But the cuffs were too strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE STOP! PLEASE STOP!\" You scream, banging your head to the pillow and body to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea looked up in surprise, but smirked as she continued even harder and faster on your beautiful soft feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOHOHOHO! PLEHEHEHEHE~\" You swing your body left and right. Not being able to take it anymore. You try your best sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP!\" You scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, she did. You looked at her tirelessly. She turned to the 2 ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we'll have to leave that out of the video. Can't let the public see our leader begging like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 ladies nodded and took the cameras with them. When they left, Chelsea climbed on top of you and started making out with you. You returned the kiss. Despite being humiliated and tortured, your body was burning for some love. You felt your wrists being freed as you both wrapped your arms around each others back, rolling on the bed. She then pinned your arms above your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my support. That being said, I hope to see you soon.\" She said winking at you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to head to your next meeting. But as soon as you walked outside, Alison called you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elise! It's an emergency! Our current leader, Jenna, was captured! The election has been moved to days from now since it's a red alert!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot. I only did a deal with Chelsea. Not the other 2.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hopefully that's enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to call her and let her know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hang up and called Chelsea<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chelsea-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, everyone heard. Don't worry, the video will be uploaded to every Television in the next hour. I already made a video campaign the day you emailed me so that will be included with the tickling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...wow, thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise you it's a guarantee win since I want a strong, powerful lady to...make me happy.\" She said sexually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, the promise was fulfilled as you being tickled was shown to the whole frontier. Chelsea even had analysis analyzed you being tickled which was embarrassing, but it did sound informative and positive. When election day came around, you won on a landslide. You dressed appropriately to address the press and citizens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my dear citizens, I am proud to be your leader. I know me being the new leader has happened on a short notice. But I promise you I have well planned ideas for the future of The New Frontier. May we all prosper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers rang across the public. And finally, the questions from the press came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been supported by one of the big 3 corporations of this frontier. What does this mean for the other small businesses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can assure you that Ms. Chelsea wants nothing but the best for the future of The New Frontier. I will be working...closely with her to make sure my plans will go accordingly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you attempt to rescue our former leader, Jenna? Or will you leave her to her captors knowing she can come back and take back her leadership position?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will. Ms. Jenna has done a wonderful job. I will speak to everyone involve to gather all the facts and find a formidable solution to bring her back. She is one of us and must be saved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the questions, you meet the council and briefed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The captor on tape was wearing a cloak and gloves, so we couldn't see the skin color. But this only leaves The Dark Souls and Elven Society. Surprisingly, they both answered right away saying they have information on who did it. However, both of them require you to come with only 2 guards maximum. It's highly a trap by both and they are both untrustworthy, but who do you want to visit?\"</span></div></div>",

But as leader, they had to accept your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be escorted by Stella and Mia. Twins born and raised by the Vanguards. Be careful, my lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took days travelling to the land of The Dark Souls. It was in an area where there was a mix of a forest to the left and a mountainous/desert area to the right. Lots of space for kidnappers to hide. The twins stayed on guard the whole time, their face remaining the same. You tried making conversation with them, only to be ignored, or only answered with brief answers. The caravan arrived in front of this HUGE wall, spreading what looks like miles. There was a huge metal gate and a man...no, a small teenager wearing only a cloth around his waist. As you got closer, you can see the dirt around his face and body. As you and the twins got off, they drew their swords, and the kid raised his arms up in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peace, please, please.\" He said shaking. You signaled for them to put the weapons away. The kid sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I am Johnathan. I will be escorting you to our leader.\" He said, giving a polite bow. While his greeting did seem sincere, you were still concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...part of The Dark Souls?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Well, yes and no. I was born here and have a citizenship. However, my father and everyone else said I was weak. Every weakling is responsible for guarding the outside of the fortress from attacks. We're just expendable causalities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't feel bad for me. You're not suppose to. We don't need or want friends from the outside. Especially not women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why? What did we do to get them so riled up? Why can't we live in peace\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighs. Then looks around to make sure no one is looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you seem like a caring person. This place is dangerous. You're not the first important figure to show up and to never leave. We're not good people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I HAVE to free Jenna. Your leader said he has information on her. Did she get taken by you people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I'm not involved in politics unless I'm told by someone else that a diplomat or representative is coming. I was also guarding the side of the wall until today so I wasn't told if this Jenna person was captured or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder, still nervous about going in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're being honest with me, what do YOU think of me being able to safely get in and get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whoever is brought or invited here cannot be touched by the commoners...that is, unless the authorities gives the okay signal. So I can guarantee your safety of being able to travel our streets and seeing our leader. I can't, however, guarantee you getting out of there safely. Soooo....\" He says looking at the twins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you two think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wish is our command.\" They both said with no emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lots of nasty men in poor clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This area is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the peasants, homeless. While this may seem like an oxymoron, even the evil have systematic rules to follow. These people are the ones that like to...step on the line of the rules. Some even cross them. So our leadership punishes them by giving them harsh living conditions. That being said, they are ruthless when given prisoners to feast on. Amazonian or Barbarian ladies are their favorites. Some of the older ones prefer young Elven guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they, what? Tickle them to death?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. They do their best to take care of their health and skin since our leaders rarely give them any slaves to play with. Which again, may seem like an oxymoron.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and what he said seems true. Lots of Amazonian and Barbarian ladies are being tickled. But some are being washed and forced fed. You even seen an elven male being surrounded by hairy old men, just tickling him to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany turn their heads facing you. It sends chills down your spine, but not to the twins. John notices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're scared, but like I said, even evil follows law. Every single one of us have pride. Those who have committed crime are publicly tortured and humiliated for life. The last person who broke the law was sentenced to be tickled by an Elven slave. Everyone laughed at him when they saw his...well...At the end, he lives in hiding away from the public. And since it's rare for someone to commit a crime, that criminal is talked about for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" You say relaxing a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk further into town, you notice the streets being more cleaner and classier. Lots more men who looks more clean shaven wearing tuxedos. All of them look at your group, smirking. Some licking their lips. But like John promised, not one person touched you. You even see the Amazonian and Barbarian slaves looking prettier. Some have their hair done, and some have make up on. And knowing that they both take pride in being strong, looking more feminine was actually embarrassing for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reached a huge looking castle. Many guards patrolled the area. If you were captured, it doesn't seem like there was a way out without being noticed. The 2 guards at the castle door looked at you. Then placed their hand in front of the door. Without touching it, the doors opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, inside the castle was very modern like. There was an electronic gate, a cobble stone bridge with a small fish bank underneath. Cool sofas with vending machines. And an elevator at the end of the room. All the people inside looked like businessmen...And while they didn't seem nice, they didn't exactly seem...Evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These people are?\" You ask quietly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His group of people that do research for him. Think of everyone part of the RnD department. We stay the strongest by researching magic as well as genetics. And of course, accountants, financial analysis, and others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be amazed if I were you. They're still evil and they all have done...VERY horrendous things to get the opportunity to work here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's better for you not to know. Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Johnathan to the elevator as his fingers start glowing. Without touching a button, the top floor button lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need magic to operate the elevator?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For identity purposes. It's a mix of magic, tech, and biology. That glow around my finger is like my passport. It confirms my identity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn shakes his head as the elevator door open. As you walked inside the room, you noticed how red it was. Not the sexy kind of red, but an evil one. You felt the dark energy around the room. You looked at the desk and noticed the chair turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, your honorary guest have arrived.\" John said, bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chair turned around. You expected the leader to be some scary, mean guy. But instead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, welcome. You must be Elise. My goodness, you are beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore getting a better look at him, he disappeared from his chair and in less than half a second, he appeared in front of you. You look up and notice a very good looking man. He looked like he was 28. He had a five o clock shadow as a beard and his hair was slick back, but wow. You have never seen a handsome man like him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins quickly reacted by pulling out their swords and pointing it at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOAHHHH! Ladies, please.\" He said, putting his hands up. But right when he did that, he flicked his fingers, and all the twins clothes fell off. They had a slight shock in their face and covered their breasts and tried putting their legs closer together, but still held their swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, please. If I wanted to harm your leader, I would have done it. I just want to have a chat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins wouldn't budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright.\" You assured them. They put their swords down as the leader snapped his fingers, causing the clothes to reappear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your guards can stay here, but I want to talk to you in private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, slave boy. Go back to your position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nods and leaves takes the elevator back down. He walks you to his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies. Let me introduce myself. I am Damien, leader of The Dark Souls. I asked you to come to make a deal with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know where Jenna is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not her direct location, but I know where she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you...tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, yes. The Elven society got her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they take her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows? Political reasons, most likely. Or their leader has a massive crush on Jenna. Either way, I do have a proposal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hear it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging by the situation, I imagine they emailed you as well. If you have went to them, they would have probably told you I have Jenna. But she's not here and you are free to look around if you don't believe me. However, they don't know you're here right now. So what I want you to do is this.\" He said, giving you a tiny coin bag tightly sealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to pretend you are doing the deal with their leader. And when the time is right, throw this at the leader. This bag will react to their elven skin and explode. Let us take care of the rest and Jenna will be safely returned. Do we have a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In order to make up for their lack of strength, they use technology as their weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can play 2 characters:<br>\r\n1) <i><u><b>Elise</b></u></i>: A diplomat who's primary goal is to be the leader of this frontier. Your goal is to gain as much power as you possibly can to have support from the citizens which means doing \"business\" deals with local citizens and shops. Will you accept the deals from big corporations, or mom and pop shops? How will you deal with potential allies/enemies? Are you willing to sacrifice yourself or your own civilians for power? The choice is yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) <u><i><b>Evie</b></i></u>: A very skilled fighter for your group of people. Not only are you strong, you also have technique and speed when it comes to fighting. Your need for advance weaponry and equipment is very minimal. With that being said, you have the ability to choose your own career path. Will you fight for yourself, your people, corporations, or the government. Do you want to fight for justice, fame, or wealth? The choice is yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>Amazonians</b></i></u>: A very feared group of large, strong women that lives in the jungle. They wear animal skins for clothing and fight large strong animals for fun. From birth they are trained to fight, not bowing down to anyone. Their leadership consists of the leader of the amazons and her generals. While they constantly fight each other for their own piece of land in the jungle, they have a very family like mindset where \"only I can pick/fight with my own sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can play as 2 characters:<br>\r\n1) <u><i><b>Xena</b></i></u>: The newest general of the amazons with your own small army. What are you like as a leader? Are you a tyrant? Or would you want to be more friendly towards your group? Do you have plans on being the leader of the amazon or do you learn your place as the new lady?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) <u><i><b>Zendaya</b></i></u>: An amazon with sort of a different mindset of the group. While living in the jungle is nice, why not have allies and trade with other frontiers? Your thought process is that if there is less fighting, the population and the strength of the amazons can increase. However, it's never easy to have a different voice from the majority. How will you deal with the pressure from society? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Other Frontiers:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) <u><i><b>The Dark Souls</b></i></u>: The only society in the New Frontier where it is completed dominated by men. Not much are known about them since every time the frontiers send scouts to learn more information, almost all never return. And the very, very few that do return are never the same. When you look at their eyes, it seems like their souls are taken away. When asked to speak about what they went through, they either don't respond, or scream and shake in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2)<u><i><b> Elven Society</b></i></u>: The highly sought out Elvens live in the forest. Some are alright with doing business in the outside world, but some are not. Their ability to do magic either amazes or frightens people. Some elvens are captured for both their beauty and soft skin, while others are captured for their magic. But there are also rumors that Elvens do the same, which creates a distrust between the Elven's and the other Frontiers. Also note that there are both Males and Females in this society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) <u><i><b>The Barbarians</b></i></u>: Similar to the Amazons where they are also very strong. Except they live out in the deserts and mountains. While there isn't exactly a leader, they make decisions based on a group vote. While not exactly the brightest of the bunch, it's been reported that the sheer amount of strength and number of Barbarians during a raid is overwhelming. That being said, they don't do deals. They steal. </td>",
