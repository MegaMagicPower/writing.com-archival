It's very personal, I can't show it to friends or family. I share a lot of my writing with them, but this one will get them emotional, their reactions won't be to my <i>writing</i>, more likely, they'll respond to the sentiments expressed in the poem. I want someone who'll respond to the content <i>and</i> the writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough quite computer un-savvy, I decide to go to the internet, and I search \"Free Poetry Contest\". (I don't have a credit card, to pay online, and besides, I don't really want to spend money to share my poem anyway!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI click on some of the results, they're not really free, those sites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen - the screen goes pale yellow, and blue and black writing shows up. A little hesitantly, I fill in the information required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly - woooo - My poem is online! I have a black portfolio! I'm a registered author! I have a hundred gift points in my account (What are gift points? I wonder.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, I log on again. I rub my eyes in disbelief. I have some new emails. Someone emailed me on the site? Must be a mistake somewhere. I've been here an hour, nobody even knows me yet! I read the emails. Praises and suggestions for my writing. Encouragement. More gift points (I wish I knew what gift points are!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI read the reviews. I wonder whether to follow the suggestions ...</span></div></div>",

I noticed I had one new email. Curious, I opened the email and I was gifted a three-month upgrade membership from RAOK. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was glad I got a membership, but what was RAOK? And why did they give me a membership? Me, of all people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy, I clicked on the chat button again, read the rules, checked the box and entered chat. I was in \"The Lobby\" I clicked on the icon at the top that resembled a door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scrolled to the bottom of the page and clicked on a random room that had people in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, lots of people were saying \"hi\" or just my username. I said \"hi\" back and continued chatting with them. While I was chatting, I was told, by the system, I got a new review. I went to my email, and woulda look at that. I got another review on my poem. I clicked on it to read it and the review was warm and fuzzy, but also very helpful. The reviewer told me if I made changes, they would come back and re-review it for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am liking this place,\" I said out loud. Since I had gotten a lot of reviews on my poem telling me how I should change it, I thought about going to improve my poem. Or, I could wander around writing.com<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I rarely can do multitasking on the site. I'm one of those people who can't write with any kind of sound or distraction of any sort in the background. I can't even have multiply tabs open in my browser. When I decide to sit and write something, doesn't matter poetry, story or even blog entry, I switch off the music, close myself in the room and I don't respond to anyone. When we had chat option here before, I hung around every single day with Charlie and Adi. I remember that time Charlie and I did a lot of blogging and when I felt like writing my daily entry I had to leave chat completely in order to focus myself on the daily prompt. If you are a member of any blogging group on the site you know that, in order to participate in monthly challenge, you have to write entries based on daily prompts. These prompts usually don't require from you to be creative, they are mostly expressing your opinion about certain theme, object and they don't require too much of  writing effort. However, I was still like: \"Okay guys, I have to go and write my entry for today. I'll be back in about hour and a half\" while Charlie for example could write his entry and, at the same time, have a conversation with both of us in chat. So, yeah, on Writing.Com I can only do one thing at the time. Everything else I'd need a huge amount of effort and be completely free from any real life obligations in order to succeed through the monthly long writing challenges (one such example is also \"<a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/forums/item_id/456789-Game-of-Thrones\" title=\"Postponed until further notice\" target=\"_top\">Game of Thrones</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"Postponed until further notice\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/forums/item_id/456789-Game-of-Thrones\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are so many interesting features, activities, contests on the site that provide great fun. Sometimes, when I really have nothing to do or if I suffer some kind of writer's block, I scroll down pages of forums and groups to see if there is anything I haven't seen before. I love to run into activities that are created long time ago and are no longer active. Most of the time I scroll through the pages of authors who can't be seen around on a daily basis, who don't enter contests, who don't participate in popular activities and people who I never got the chance to exchange email with, review or something. It amazes me the quality of work in their portfolio and I wish them to get involved in the community little bit more, to let their writing be noticed or just be like some kind of refreshment when it comes about public newsfeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI usually write when I feel like writing. I don't believe in \"If you want to get somewhere you have to keep writing all the time\". This kind of thinking doesn't apply for me because I can't just write whatever and pile up my portfolio with numerous drafts which I would probably delete at some point. I admit that there are times when I come up with, to me, awesome lines and thoughts that I can use in my poetry and of course I store them in notepad or my private blog for creative ideas but that's the hardest I can go when it comes about writing whatever for the sake of staying in writing mood. Lately, I wrote plenty of poetry for the contests on the site. While I think this is great because it keeps me focused, it also distracts me because these aren't poems I really want to write. I write them only for the sake of whatever prompt is given. I guess this can happen when you don't have a writer's goal, something you always go back to because you have plans regarding publishing maybe or when you didn't establish your own writing style, mood and you like to explore different things in order to get one which is my case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when I decide to write another poem, it is usually because I just suddenly, with no specific reason, feel like writing <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">.</span></div></div>",

I have quite a few gift points now.  However, I am unsure of what to do with them still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, while reading through my reviews the person who suggested pizza for my other poem has now given me a suggestion for another.  Hmm, he says to add the word \"yummy\" to the end of my poem.  I will do it because he has been a member for two days more than I have, so he must be an expert by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis handle is a strange one...\"melikeyfoodlots\" I wonder what he means by that.  I will  ask him, when I figure out how to use my email.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, he has sent me one last suggestion:  The words \"in my tummy.\"  Well, this one is the most strange.

I think Mr. melikeyfoodlots has sent a message with all these suggestions.  I put the words together and they say \"Pizza, yummy in my tummy!\"  There is no way that this guy is a poetry expert.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I will be more careful in using suggestions from now on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm...Pizza does sound good right now...</span></div></div>",

She was thrilled. Plus, it really helped me out in a pinch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI love the WDC gift point system. I think it is wonderful how you can earn GP doing reviews or entering writing contests. It makes the process encouraging and fun. The old saying it is better to give than receive is so true. The GP system allows people like myself (low income) to give back, that can afford no other means. There is no greater satisfaction than contributing to a great cause, and the WDC community is a truly great cause. </span></div></div>",

Some of us, such as myself, enjoy being part of a larger writing group online, because of that honest feedback. It is through that feedback that we improve as writers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of reviewing. If you are new, make sure to check out the many member created review groups on the site. The site already awards reviewers with reviews over 250 characters, but you have the opportunity to earn even more gps. Plus many of these review groups offer excellent prizes and fun activities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother way to get involved is to take part in member created groups and contests. You can search them by type by clicking, \"search by type\", which is located on the left. Whatever your genre or type of writing, there is most likely a group or contest that fits you. Most contests offer rewards, rather it be gps, ribbons, or badges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of these groups and contests are funded by auctions and/or raffles. This is a writing community with members who have plenty of imagination, which makes some of these raffles quite fun and interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany members have blogs. Stopping by to give them a read, helps you get to know the fellow author. Just make sure to leave a comment, letting them know you paid a visit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more involvement you have with fellow members, rather it be groups, contests, activities,  responses, or reviewing, the more likely others will view your writing.  Just as in life offline, if you never give in return, others tend to stop giving back. So, take the time to become active with your fellow members. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n287 Words<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I LOVE entering contests and different activities on WdC. There are few reasons for that; first reason is awards. Who doesn't like awardIcons and MBes? <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bigsmile.png\" alt=\"*Bigsmile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Bigsmile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> There is some satisfaction when your work is recognized this way, when you manage to get into top three among so many awesome authors on the site. It gives you some kind of hope that there is probably a great writer somewhere inside of you who might as well become greater than the site contests one day. I usually don't enter contest with confidence, thinking my work is much better than anyone else's, no. My first thought when I submit entry is that I am positive sure someone will read what I just wrote, even if those views are from the judges only. I love to see people's interest in whatever I write. Even when I post something in the newsfeed, like blog entry for example, I get views quickly even if I don't receive a lot of comments. I'm okay with that because I also read a lot around the site but don't comment too much on anything. But I know someone is interested in reading and that's what's the most important to me on WdC. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond reason why I love entering different contests and activities is that I STILL haven't found my own writing style and exploring variety of genres, themes, and types help me to find what suits me the most. When I just joined the site, my first and primal idea was to work on my biographical novel. However, that became long forgotten dream because I run into different obstacles regarding theme of the novel and I got distracted by real life as well. There was also language barrier since I'm not native English speaker. One year later I felt like completely different person with completely different writing goals and my 50k words first draft is collecting dust in my portfolio. What I'm doing right now, I don't know. Few months ago I set the goal for myself; I started to write poetry about grief and its influence after dad died with intention to publish a book of poetry one day but right now I'm in some confusing state of mind because, again, real life's issues (like job, school) that are blocking the creative side of me. I can see this book also being tossed aside. My main problem is that my writing isn't fictional and if I don't live through something I lose creativity. This is also one of the reasons why I enter different contests on the site because I really hope one day I'll manage to find fictional writing style that won't disappear as soon as I stop to feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it comes about activities, I do them for fun as well. Different kind of fun of course. They help me to keep myself present on the site, to do things I normally wouldn't do (like writing 130 reviews in one month <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/shock.png\" alt=\"*Shock*\" title=\"Shock\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">) and similar stuff. WdC is great community, full of awesome writers and nice people who make those activities even more fun than they already are. I can appreciate that.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I first joined this amazing writing community in October of 2013. Honestly, I didn't even read much of anyone else's writing.  I just posted five chapters of a poorly written novel. After a week of noticing a few views, but no reviews, I disappeared for a few months. When I logged on, I had one rating, with no review. And that rating was three stars. Now I realize the writing had several issues, but at the time, my ego was quite hurt. I spent a lot of effort on the writing and was quite proud of it. The least the person could have done is tell me how I could improve it. So, I did something that is a bit rude, I e-mailed the person asking them what the issue was. A few days later, there was a curt response that included, \"I just didn't like it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, I stuck around, adding my poetry to my portfolio. I entered Dark Dreamscapes with a darker piece, but didn't win. Eventually, I began reading items that were rewarded to see what I was lacking. Still, my time on here was extremely limited. The first year, I might have come on here two or three times a month. After being a member for about six months, I finally got an extensive review on my novel showing me the errors in the plot, which became clear that it needed a lot of editing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until being a member for a full year that I actually conducted my first review. I wouldn't call it extensive, but it was to the point offering what I considered honest feedback. The memory of the lack of clarity from my first reviewer in comparison to the second more helpful review stuck in my mind. Knowing how that felt, I did offer suggestions. Though, I probably only conducted ten or so reviews in a years time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn 2015, I began sharing more of my writing here, and moved on to an upgraded membership, so that I could have more space for my writing. That is also when I began reviewing regularly. At first it was a selfish endeavor, because I realized that noticing others encouraged them to read my writing. Then I realized that finding the strengths and weaknesses in the writing of others actually helped me improve on my own writing. Before I knew it, I was making some very good friends, some of which were instrumental in helping me improve my writing skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy 2016, I was heavily active in the site. Some might call it an addiction. There are so many activities available that it can be quite distracting. The more member created activities that I got involved with, the more I seemed to branch out into other genres and forms of writing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast year I was moved up to Preferred author, which is acquired through being active writing and reviewing. That is a long way from the woman you posted a novel and disappeared for months at a time. So far, as of now, September of 2017, I have now conducted 655 reviews, a large portion of those quite extensive. And, I have almost 200 items in my port. Quite a long way in comparison to 2013 when I first joined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord Count: 548<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I didn't really believe that before but since the last two years, I have actually witnessed this on my own,how my work is improved by reviewing others' works. I pick up their mistakes and points and when I am writing mine, I remember those points and try to avoid them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I do like reviews and receiving them, no matter what kind of a review it is. I care that the other person has read my work and has taken the time out to let me know of that in a review, whether it is a thorough one or a short, small five lined one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, if I were to choose the qualities and things that I really, really appreciate in a review then they would be:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1. Honesty:<br>\r\n</b>I want to know what the reader thought of my work, I don't want a fluffly, pink review full of praises and applauds without any reason. i'd like to know exactly what the reader liked, what he didn't like, what could be improved, why he liked the story or the poem and how he related to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2. Improvement:<br>\r\n</b>My stories or poems are far from perfect, I know that and accept it especially because English is my second language and I do not have much knowledge about English punctuation and its proper usage. However, I am learning it along the way and it is one of the most important things that I see in a review and deeply appreciate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want the reviewer to tear apart my work and give me pointers, hints, ways to further improve my work and take it to another level. I don't just want a suggestion or a correction, I appreciate reviews in which they have written in detail why I should change my oriignal sentence to what and why and how it is better in the other way around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>3. Emotions<br>\r\n</b>I love to know how the readers felt after reading my work or about my work. I appreciate reviews that tell me how my work made me feel, how their mood was influenced, if a tear or two came to their eyes or perhaps they laughed, smiled, felt very emotional, teary eyed, hurt, pained. Another thing that I think comes under Emotions would be relating to my work. I'd like to know if the reader was able to relate to my work and in what way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese are the things I really love to see in reviews I get and appreciate them too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n436 words</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There is one unpleasant situation I had with a newbie that I will always remember and I got myself involved in it while doing reviews of course. I don't quite remember which year it was, maybe two years ago or even last year, I don't know. I remember I was doing reviews for The Newbie Welcome Wagon so I, of course, checked public \"Read a Newbie\" page in order to find some writing. I usually review poetry and sometimes short stories that count 500 or more words. Very rarely I review flash fiction because most of the time I don't know what to say in a review, especially if I need to reach 1000 characters count. Anyway, I clicked to this random flash fiction (or whatever that was) and decided to share my thoughts about what I just read. The thing is, the story I read wasn't really a story. It was more like random notes, or thoughts, like, just few paragraphs about something that is the beginning of one's writing. It did have the main idea, it just looked like it wasn't finished. Don't ask why I even read it and not to mention review such thing haha. I thought people post their writing on the site in order to receive someone else's opinions or something and the fact such writing was available for reviewing I thought this author expected opinions of course. That's what I do here on the site anyway- if my writing is available to everyone's eyes and opinion I expect someone will care enough to share their own. If I get random book or poetry ideas I write them down in my private blog that isn't available to anyone's eyes and later I use them when writing something useful from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't remember what the story was about but I will never forget the awkward writing style and lack of punctuation. If you ever received a review from me or if you check my public review page, you'll see that I'm not really harsh in my reviews. I always share good points and things I didn't find appealing while reading in order to keep the balance in a review. Same happened with this newbie's writing. I started with regular greeting and made a good points of the story first before continuing with suggestions which focused mostly around writing style and lack of punctuation, not the story itself. I think I gave it 3 stars rating which now I think was too high for such writing. The response I received was obnoxious. This newbie finished screaming at me, saying how she is ill and because of her illness she couldn't write the story much better. I thought someone is making a really bad joke with me because I don't know any kind of illness that prevent people from using punctuation in their writing <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/think.png\" alt=\"*Think*\" title=\"Think\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">. I replied to her that I think she needs to calm down and that this is just my personal opinion as I think punctuation in writing is crucial element. She then replied threatening how she will report me to the site owners how I'm being rude and how I harase her after which I realized she is some sort of psycho so I finished blocking her. To this day I have no idea what was that all about. I think I still have her username in my block list but I didn't check it out ever since to see if she's still on the site. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then I rarely do reviews for newbies because I know how sensitive they can be and I try to keep myself away from these kind of people. I even stopped with greeting and meeting them around the site or newbies forums. I know this is a really weird newbie case and it doesn't mean everyone is obnoxious like this author but, since then, I can't make myself to go out there willing to meet our newest members on the site. </span></div></div>",

This is one of the oldest and also bestest memories I have about being a newbie because I felt really welcomed and important for having them close. And being a member of such wonderful group of people helped me being noticed around which is, I believe, the primal thought for any newbie when they first join some writing community; to gain readers, reviewers and draw attention to their writing portfolio overall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew weeks after, <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'pabernardy8', '', '', '', '10', '', 'OFF', '100835222'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'pabernardy8', '', '', '', '10', '', 'OFF'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: pabernardy8\r\nMember Since: October 31st, 2010\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;cursor:pointer;\">Patrick</a></span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/pabernardy8','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/pabernardy8\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'pabernardy8', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  10/10/19', '10/10/19', 'October 31, 2010', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a> invited me to join his awesome reviewing group, \"<a href=\"\" title=\"\" target=\"_top\">Invalid Item</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> where I learned a lot about reviewing and writing overall through his monthly newsletters that he put together with couple of more great authors. It was a wonderful organization and one of my favorite activities on the site ever invented. I was featured as a writer and reviewer couple of times, I got more traffic in my port and couple of more friends who are still around. As soon as I lost my newbie status (6 months period) I got promoted to preferred author. I wasn't around too much when it happened because I was busy with work and real life but I remember the excitement and also confusion when I Iogged in one day and saw my case color turned yellow. I knew what case colors represent before it happened but I didn't think I deserved promotion because I was more away than I was present on the site and my writing skills weren't really good, my English was, kind of, bad and after I got back to work I wasn't thinking too much about writing or coming here more often. Promotion to preferred author was something that dragged me back in again. This kind of site's promotions have a special charm every time someone's case color change and, considering what each color represent on Writing.Com, it makes you feel more important of course and you get some kind of responsibility to keep doing good job in the future as well. So, overall, my best experience as a new member was that I was lucky enough to meet people kind enough to help me being noticed in my first month and people from who I could learn a lot about writing and reviewing and who shaped me into a member I am today <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">.</span></div></div>",

The father that genes that is part of my genetic make-up, wrote music and poetry. He was quite talented in these ways, but I was not raised by him. I met him when I was much older, after I had already taken interest in art and writing. Though, it is interesting how you can be so much like a parent, when you are not even raised around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the age of three until the age of seven, my mother was married to a decent man, who played guitar. Mostly what he sang were tunes by other musicians, but occasionally he would write his own when he was moved to do so. Since he saw value in the arts and individuality, he encouraged my imagination. And boy did I have one! I was an odd child! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the present, nobody around me likes to write, so I suppose that is one of the aspects that encourages me to keep logging on. It is refreshing to be around those who, much like me, express themselves in the written word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis does not mean that I don't have anyone that supports me being a writer. My current boyfriend is pretty amazing with his encouragement. He may not like to write, but he's got a demented imagination, like mine, if not even more distorted. So, I often throw around ideas with him. He comes up with some interesting concepts and he's got quite the sense of humor. It was his idea to give the character in my vampire story a heavy flow and to die in the tampon isle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, I will be moving to Austin, where there are more supportive people that have similar interests as me, which is a more supportive environment for my creative endeavors.  Living out in the country, very few are like me, so I am excited about the change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That's, actually, how I met Charlie here- through his poetry. We didn't know each other right away even though we are only around two months apart from the time we first signed up to this site. I was pretty much away first few months because I had to go back to work so we weren't talking to each other or knew each other well. I think I remember I made a post about tattoos once and he joined discussion we had. Then he signed up to \"<a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/forums/item_id/1974137-Give-It-100\" title=\"Write daily on Writing.Com for 100 days and earn an exclusive merit badge!

Meanwhile it was my time to go back to work again but I kept logging on here to read and comment on those entries he stored to, now, my favorite poetry collection; \"<a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/books/item_id/2034524-Fragments-of-Being\" title=\"My first poetry collection, anywhere from polished pieces to rambling drafts.\" target=\"_top\">Fragments of Being</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"My first poetry collection, anywhere from polished pieces to rambling drafts.\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/books/item_id/2034524-Fragments-of-Being\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>. Little by little we started to communicate through emails, comments, and IMs and his poetry started to seem more clear to me when I got familiar with the background of each. It is usually said that poetry isn't written to be understood but simply loved, though you need to admit that knowing from where the author gets his inspiration helps you more in understanding his writing because most of the readers desire to know what the writing is all about rather than being completely confused after they finish with reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWdC has a lot of worthy authors and poets. I think the reason why Charlie is my favorite is because I can <i>feel</i> whatever he writes about which is something I appreciate the most in any author. That is usually what determine a great author in my opinion; ability to make readers feel for their writing. I can easily recognize his writing anywhere because, to me, it has a unique tone and mood. Sometimes when he is busy with school or just real life overall, and when he doesn't post a lot of writing on the site, I start to miss it. I usually go and read his old poetry when I miss it or I tell him to write something new <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/laugh.png\" alt=\"*Laugh*\" title=\"Laugh\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">. Sometimes I tell him I'm his biggest fan and we laugh at how creepy it sounds but he still knows it is true. I wish he consider to publish poetry book because I know it would be successful and I would love to have it on my book shelf in case something happens with his online portfolio. Well, we usually don't think about leaving this place but we never know what may happen in the future. I think I would literally die if his writing disappear just like that since his portfolio is the only portfolio I go back to and his writing is the only writing on the site I have read couple of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, basically, this is why Charlie is my favorite poet on the site- I can always read his writing because each time I can feel something and I am never bored with reading his stuff over and over again <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">.</span></div></div>",

However, I found that their taste in literature is not the same as my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling that I should still repay the kindness given to me, I continued to search the site for items that I would like to review.  It was then that I found the keyword option when looking for something to read.  I inputed a topic that I enjoy and I was rewarded with a list of over a hundred stories, poems, books, and other items related to my keyword.  I went through the list and it was a mixed bag.  Some of the items are perfectly written but use an overdone theme.  Others have a provocative idea behind them but are filled with typos and grammatical errors.  A few are true gems, perfect in every way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally I discovered something called the review request page.  These are people who really want my input.  While I didn't put my poem on this page, I probably would have if I had known about it.  </span></div></div>",

I read and write in almost any genre: comedy, mystery, scifi, fantasy, historical fiction, romance, horror. I have even dabbled in poetry and written some non-fiction. The one thing I do not read or write is inspirational, specifically spiritual literature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not a religious person so I don't feel qualified to comment on articles of faith. Imagine my surprise when I start reading a beautiful poem with the intention of writing a review, only to discover it is about the author's faith in God. I stop reading immediately. I can't review this. I don't know anything about God or faith or any of that stuff. What if I accidentally insult the author in my review? It would be like insulting their religion. My cursor hovers over the 'X' tab but something stops me from closing the poem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis person has posted this poem on the review request page, which means they are looking for honest opinions, and I pride myself on my honesty. I can't not review it now. It would be a cop-out; so much for honesty. I decide to treat the poem like any other. I will read it and give an honest review. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start my review with the disclaimer that I am not a religious person so I will not comment on belief. I will limit my comments strictly to the quality of the writing and the impressions it made. As I wrote the review I quickly came to the realization that though I didn't share the author's faith I truly admired and enjoyed their poem. It was beautifully written and left me with a joyful feeling. It was very uplifting. I told them as much in my review. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sent off the review expecting a curt, 'Thanks for the review,' if anything in return. What I received back was a long letter of appreciation for the review. The author told me they were grateful I reviewed the poem despite the difficulty. They said their work gets very few reviews and they believe it's because their work is always about their faith and extremely personal. The author loved my review and told me it meant even more to them BECAUSE I am not religious. If the poem was uplifting and joyous to me then that was a wonderful accomplishment. The writer considered my review the most encouraging they had ever received. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just goes to show that there are people that sincerely want to hear your opinions, no matter how much you may think otherwise. Don't be afraid to say what you think when asked. Be respectful but honest and you maybe surprised what you learn in return. </span></div></div>",

No more pouring through tons of titles trying to decide what to review. I would simply leave it to chance. Brilliant! I silently vowed I would review anything that came up no matter what genre or how poorly written. With nail-biting trepidation, I pressed the dice icon and fate presented my first random piece for review. It was a wonderful little 12 line poem that I enjoyed very much. I sent out the review feeling elated and anxious to see what came next.  I pressed the dice icon again. Oh boy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a short story of moderate length on the screen in front of me. I looked at the content rating, XGC. Okay, that doesn't really bother me. I am not offended by language and my favorite genre to read and write is horror, which gets pretty graphic. I read the title. No help there just a couple of names. The story could be about anything. I read the description line. Uh oh, erotica. This could be trouble. I swore to review whatever appeared so I strengthen my resolve and start to read. Oh no... my goodness... oh my word... <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/blush.png\" alt=\"*Blush*\" title=\"Blush\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm no prude, but the more I read the warmer my face feels. I know I am blushing like a school girl. How am I going to write a review of this when I am not even comfortable reading it in mixed company? I feel a headache coming on. Once again, I renew my determination and try to think of polite ways to discuss the explicit nature of the story. After two grueling hours of tiptoeing over eggshells I finish my review. I am satisfied it is honest and tactful. I send it off, and breathe a sigh of relief. I do NOT push the dice icon again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The ending has a good twist and I am satifactorily frightened.  I only wish that I hadn't had to wade through so many spelling errors to get through the piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that I appreciate constructive criticism, I decide to review the entire novel, telling the author what I like about the story first.  I tell her that I know it's a novel in progress, but I have some suggestions that may help, and I point out two dozen spelling errors and the fact that the plot could be a little more creative, to better capture the reader's attention in the beginning.  I tell her that it was definitely a ghost story that impacted me - I am afraid of falling asleep in the dark now and will keep a light on throughout the night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentitavely, I press the \"send\" button and my review disappears, floating through cyberspace to its intended location.  Sighing heavily, I note that I have been in my cramped chair for hours and have forgotten to eat dinner.
