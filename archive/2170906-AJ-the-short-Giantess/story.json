Your back has been hurting dreadfully for hours now, and AJ offers to help. With her black boots off in her fishnet stockings, you lay on your belly as she walks on your back, slowly and carefully.. It felt amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ was 5,0, so her weight didn't hurt. Her brown hair was cut short, but not too short. You stand a good seven inches over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your back felt better the two of you sit up and get back in your chairs. You pick at our food as AJ places her black boots on again. You turn to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, that felt great\", you say to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Always glad to help a friend\", she says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, \"Wish I could pay you back. It seems like I'm always taking advantage of our friendship\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you sit in silence for a while, until she sits up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:\"You know\", she starts, \"There is ONE thing you could do for me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" you turn to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ nods her head and reaches into her backpack. You watch closely, wondering if she possibly needed any help with homework, or for you to look over a book she was trying to write. However, neither a book or a sheet of homework was pulled out, but rather, a wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god\", you groan to yourself. Here she goes with that Wiccan crap again. AJ always said questionable things to you. The whole They/Them pronouns was one thing, but this really took the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...I just would like to test something out. Would you help me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you Say?</span></div></div>",

After all, it's the least you can do for her after the job that she did for your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Oh thank you!\" she screams with glee, \"Alright, stand still. This won't hurt a bit. I think\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:\"Wait, what are you going to do to me?\" you ask with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see\", she says. She swings the wand over her head and points it back to you. The words, said clearly and nicely from her mouth are \"Subtraxerim Altitudo\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlowing rays of blue shoot from out her wands and pass through your very body. The light is near blinding. You rub your eyes and open them, trying to get some sort of a hint of vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your eye sight does come around, but your surroundings are no where close to what they were like before. Everything from the AJ, the desks, the chairs, and even the pencils have grown at least sixty feet. Right now, at this moment, you had been the size of a three inch toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitedly, AJ jumped up and down happy that the spell was a success. The jumps boomed throughout the room. Soon, they began to get louder as AJ ran towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come here you adorable thing\", she said in a sweet tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see a gigantic hand coming your way. Before you can move, she scoops you up from off the ground and holds you up to her happy little (I say little) face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you still want to help me?\" she asks you. Her voice is as loud as a helicopter taking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wasn't it\" you respond confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not silly\", she giggles, \"Let me explain. I can get lonely. Real lonely. I've hardly got anyone to play with or talk to when I'm at home. And you're always at work. I had another man before you, but he decided to be a little prick and he got the boot. Literally\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. Your recall that mysterious red splatter on the heel of her boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...so what now?\" you ask hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you think silly?\" she laughs, \"Now YOUR gonna be my little tiny man to keep me company. Wouldn't that be fun? What do you say? It'll only be for a year or two. I'll keep you happy. Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sweat. A year or two? She can't be serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do YOU respond?</span></div></div>",

This is the offer of a lifetime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to make up for that response, however, there's no use in bargaining. You see a giant hand reach down at you and grasp your shirt. Fiercely, she rips if off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes for your shoes, socks, pants, then underwear. Eventually, you're completely naked before the sight of her. She giggles, using her index finger to flop your tiny penis up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say I've seen a penis THAT small in my life. Though, I bet it was bigger than the last guys\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focus on trying not to get a stiff. You cover your genitals and try to look at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, thanks, can you give me my clothes back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Not after that response.\" she says, \"You're gonna have to EARN them back\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell am I supposed to do that?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" she giggles and moves over to her backpack, slipping you inside and shutting the zipper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll see nothing but darkness for the next for hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you get any sort of glimpse of light is inside of AJ's room. Pulling you out, she places you on the floor and stands up, towering over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hands on her hips, she looks down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that fun, little one?\" she asks you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thrilling\" you say without a trace of emotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear. You ready for your first challenge to earn your socks back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I don't have a choice\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving you on the ground, she steps over to her closet, opens it up, and pulls out an old, wooden doll house. Walking back to you, she sets the house right next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", she says, \"Go on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do just that, stepping up the from porch stairs and into the door. You wander around, exploring the living room, kitchen, dining room, upstairs, the attic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spot a sign at one of the doors, marking it to be your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set inside, which holds a bed, closet, desk, and window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the bed, wondering how in the hell she managed to put this all together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scent hits your nose. A burning scent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit the room to find that inside the living room is a lit cigarette, burning the mini rug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is your test. Escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Your fingers slip off and soon your're heading towards the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, when you think all is about to end, a hand swoops you up, and into a hug you go. A painful, hard to breath hug just outside of her breasts at her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings you back to her first position: You in her cupped hands as she stares down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" she says, noticing your frazzled look, \"I forgot that you're not used to that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-your fine, I-\" before you finish, you lean over and puke over the side of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ, disgusted, takes a Kleenex from a nearby desk and cleans of your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I'm so sorry, I got a little carried away.

Bells ring, AJ moves to different classes. Soon, you listen to the process of the last bell ringing, AJ leaving the school, AJ walking home, entering her house, going upstairs and into her room, and then plopping you in the backpack on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see that the zipper is being undone and see the gigantic smiling face of AJ hovering over you. Reaching in two hands, she scoops you up and places you down on the floor in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that fun, little one?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...it was thrilling!\" you say hoping to not offend her in anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles. \"Good!

AJ, the chairs, the desk, and even the pencils have started to grow larger. No, not them. YOU are getting smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rays cease, and AJ lowers her wand. AJ now towers over you, the size of the Statue of Liberty almost. She takes wand and sets it into her pocket.

She's wearing a skirt, and you could very well now get the chance to take that look you've always dreamt of having. But should you just go for it? Or maybe if she saw you licking her boots, she would reward you with a peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

However, whats done is what has been done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS YO LITTLE SHIT?!?\" she thunders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get a word out, but are simply too embarrassed and scared. Only sputters manage to leave your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd bet you'd like to get a closer look at this ass? Wouldn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say nothing.

Her face quickly changes from confusion to pure and utter disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I fucking tell you to LICK?! That's fucking disgusting! What the FUCK is wrong with you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I thought that you would appreciate it You wan't them clean, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want them POLISHED, not with your spit!

I'm sure you wanted me to do a good job. I mean, you did a wonderful job on my back. Just give me another chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thinks on it, boot still raised. Your heart pounds at the speed of a thousand pumps per minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, she puts down her boot. You sigh a great relief. But, before you know it, your being picked up by the collar of your tiny shirt. AJ gently places you in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look\", she says, \"I'm sorry I wanted to be nicer. But you've really pressed my buttons. Truth is, I get lonely. Really lonely. I've got no one to play with or talk to when I'm home, and you're always at work. I had another tiny man before you. But, he decided that he was gonna be a little shit. And you know what he got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I was about to give you\", she says, \"I was only going to keep you for a year or two. But now, I think a good decade is long enough. You better not piss me off little man\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places you in her bag. Lunch has ended, and the two of you are now off to class.

You begin to wonder if you'll ever see the light of day again.
