You exhale hard and most of it comes out, allowing you to breath finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find it hard to move, exhausted from the ordeal you just went through. A few minutes of rest and you kneel up, whiping the wet sand that sticks to your skin off your face. You take off your shirt as it is soaking and also covered in sand and head away from the tide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a breather and dropping your shirt, you look around for your friends, \"Hello!? Emily? Sar- anyone!?\" Your only response is the sound of the tide and an eerie calmness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun is very hot here, but it doesn't seem anything like Europe where you set off just six days ago from in Spain. It's tropical as you can tell from the palm trees and the storm that washed you to the shore is nowhere to be seen, hardly even a cloud in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou deceide that it would be best to worry later and go explore, hopefully to find your friends and/or food and drinkable water, you didn't manage to call for help during the storm, you doubt help will arive any time soon and you grab your shirt, tossing it over your shoulder and head off.</span></div></div>",

Not too far away, you find something of interest, it isn't food however... well, maybe not for you. You've never seen anything like it. It seems, from what you can see of it, a large equine and it's trapped in an even bigger net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething seems odd about it though you approach closer, trying to get a better view. As you do, you hear it call out... the voice however, is female and as you move closer you see a female body atop a horses body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour curiousity gets the advantage of you, getting too close, you rustle a bush and are heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human, help me, I've been caught in this trap for hours, come, don't be afraid, I won't hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move slowly towards her, looking out for more traps but your eyes are mainly focused on the strange horse-woman, her human figure is attractive to you and though below her torso her body is a horse, she still seems pretty femenime to you. Long brunette hair, light skin, barely clothed and a gorgeous complection, her horse half compliments her with a dark brown coat, she is about nine foot but she doesn't seem like a threat, more like a trapped animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, hurry, they may be back soon, yes, that's it... quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move up to the net and pick it up, seeing if you can break it with your bare hands, suddenly, you find yourself surrounded by people... not the kind you are use to though, they look primitive and carry ancient weapons, exotic swords, clubs, you don't get enough time to examine them though, five of them surround you quickly, obviously not wanting you to release the horse-woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your hands in surrender when one of them carries Emily towards the group over her shoulder. In anger you charge at them. \"Leave her alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man knees you in the stomach, forcing you to bow and then lifts you up by your hair to face an important looking woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tried to release this Centaur, you are not welcome here and you shall be punished for your crime,\" she commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean..\" \"Silince!\" she interrupts, then says something in a language you don't understand. The man that assaulted you knocks you out with his club.</span></div></div>",

Still in her so sexual grip, both scared and aroused at the same time, you were much to paralysed to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Phillippa let you free of her grip.

After the first swallow she reached your shoulders, with the second and third swallow she already  reached your waist. However then she slowed down a little and after your legs lost contact with the ground, you soon found out why. The centauress tried to lift the rest of your body above her so that she could swallow you easier. Your head and your arms were now somewhere in the human part of the centauress and with the help of gravity it wasn't that much work for her to swallow you up to your legs. By now you could feel your head squeezed through a small opening followed by your arms and the rest of your body. Her stomach smelled awfully but somehow you were still able to breath.<br>\r\nIn the moment were Phillippa was just about to swallow your feet, you started to curl up in her expanding (horse-half) stomach.<br>\r\nWith a satisfied \"gulp\" your legs and feet joined you in her fleshy prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill struggling inside her belly you tried to get in a more comfy position. Cramped as you were you could barely move but your eyes started to get used to the dim red light that shines through her.<br>\r\nAnd with a terrified look you saw the only exit out of her stomach, the passage that leads to the centauress backside. In that moment you finally realized that you only leave her as poop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhillippa on the the other hand enjoyed you struggling around in her now well rounded stomach, which sloshed and swayed every time when she moved.<br>\r\nAnd over the next few days when her acids slowly digested you, she asked herself when she would meet the next tasty person to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the third day Phillippa's (horse-part) belly was nearly back in its normal flat shape, when she felt the pressure of your remainings forcing your way to the end of her digestive tract.<br>\r\nShe then lifted her tail up and shit out a large piece of turd. After she get rid of your remains, she turned around and said: \"Well with this I fulfiled the dael. They give you to me to eat and I give them your remains as fertilizer for their fields.

Luewaila throbbed again, and your buttocks slid up into its warm, cavernous rectum. Emily paused for a moment, \"Whoa, Luewaila... Not too fast.\" The horse whinnied again and you felt your waist being consumed, your cock being pressed against your belly as it slid into the seemingly enormous mare.

Then, as you laid back down with a sigh, you felt a very strange motion. The mare had begun sucking on your cock again! You opened your eyes and looked up over your chest. You could see the mare's head at the apex of your legs, still bouncing up and down, but something was different. Her neck was becoming bulged, as if something were...something were growing inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it dawned on you, the mare's throat hadn't been getting smaller, your cock had been getting larger!

Your cock tensed, and with what could only be described as a gulping motion, it swallowed Emily up past her shoulders, pulling her up onto her tippy-toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare watched on in satisfaction, \"yes..it's working wonderfully...\" Your eyes widened in partial amazement and terror as your cock made another gulping motion, pulling Emily in down to her waist, and fully lifting her up off of the ground, hanging her now barely twitching legs out of the end of your cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced at the mare, now standing off to the side, and for a moment, you could have sworn that a tear fell from her eye. \"The birth of a beautiful abomination, a creation in abstractness the gods themselves would admire. You, boy, are the sole possessor of a gift so powerful that those species who obtained it had to be hunted to extinction. I was given a blessing from my father, Thaltos, God of the Horses, so that I may begin the cycle again. The Reign of the Vorphallus has begun again. It will not be long now, I must go. I do wish that I could stay to witness this most magnificent process, but I would place myself in danger. Tomorrow, when you have rested, travel east around the island's shore, using the Sun to guide you. After about a mile, you will find a crested plateau extending into the sea. There, I will wait for you, along with the answers you will inevitably pursue.\" The mare turned to leave and paused for a moment. \"My name...is Peleirose, and as of this moment, I no longer consider you my slave.\" With that she sped away across the shining sand, her mane flaring behind her as her muscular body propelled out of your line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerplexed, you looked back to the situation brewing between your legs. You thought to yourself, 'A gift...I...I can control it? Then....maybe I could...Emily! I must save Emily! I don't care what came over her, I love her!' And with that conclusive decision set in your mind, you, with the last of your energy, gave an effort of gargantuan proportions...</span></div></div>",

Your cock moved independently of your will, gobbling up the last of Emily's sumptuous buttocks, her smooth thighs, her feminine calves, and her minuscule feet. You braced yourself as her body moved down into your now bulging scrotum. Wiping a tear from your eye in recognition of the unchangeable past behind you, you began to ponder in silence, 'With this bulge...Emily...between my legs, how on Earth, or wherever I am, am I going to walk for a mile...? I want answers, sure, but more than that I just want to get out of here, to have things back the way they were before.' Lifting your head to the skies you cried out, \"Why!? Why did it have to be me!?\" Alas, not to your surprise, no answer called to you from above. Were it not for the grotesque sac, Emily's tomb, lying between your legs, a growingly detested link to reality, you may have convinced yourself that it had all been a dream. A very strange, and remarkably life-like dream, but nonetheless. And in your mind upon reflection, you wished no more than that were so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted from the ordeal and the intense emotions of the past few hours, you collapsed back onto the table, and there you slept, till morning come.</span></div></div>",

Then, it hits you. Your scrotum is back to its normal size! Maybe, maybe it had been a dream after all. But then the strikingly large apparatus dangling from the apex of your nude lower limbs snaps you back into reality. But what had happened to Emily?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare longingly over the beach, to the palm tree where you had watched Emily basking in the shade. You missed her, but she was gone. A price to be paid for your newly endowed tool. You reached down and lifted your monstrous cock with one hand. It was still about a foot and a half long, with a similarly static size change in its diameter. What to do? Gazing about the sky you spot, although not directly as it would have hurt, the Sun. You remember with a jolt Peleirose's instructions. Thus, you begin your trek, only a mile, so nothing to be worried about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk, you see a figure in the distance, lying at the edge of the water. It looks almost human like.

Right as you feel around one spot, it opens up and some swallowed fruit plops on your face. This is the stomach hatch! You remove the drool-covered fruit off your face and squeeze through her stomach hatch. Her esophagus is super sticky and slippery but you're desperate. You make some progress. Stream of saliva come down and land on your face, but you ignore it and keep climbing. As you dig your hands into the lioness' gullet walls, she begins to notice that you're trying to escape her digestive system. She swallows a lot of her own saliva, in an attempt to distract you. A lot of the liquid goes in between your lips as you climb higher and higher. Her saliva tastes like the berries she just consumed, and you enjoyed the taste, so you open your mouth, waiting for more. The lioness swallows more of her drool and it falls straight into your mouth. Her saliva tastes good, but you remember to keep on climbing. The sticky wetness of her esophagus becomes fascinating to you, and you decide that you want to play in her mouth for a bit before you escape. You can see the lioness' uvula above you, just hangin' around. You're finished climbing, and now you sit on the back of her tongue. Little droplets of saliva fall from her uvula and hit your head. You turn around, and a humid blast of breath greets your face. Although it smells nice, it's overwhelming so you turn around again immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Play in my mouth all you want, but sooner or later you're to end up in my belly again,\" the lioness says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer maw is flooded with light every time she opens her mouth to speak. You move yourself up, to the center of the tongue. You feel her upper palate with your hands, and you rub them across the ridges. The lioness yawns, and as she does, many strands of saliva are visible to you. However, she closes her mouth before you can escape. 'Darn,' you think. You feel around her mouth, rubbing her wet mawflesh with your hands. You rub the surface of her tongue. It's softer and squishier than you thought it would be. 'Apparently the lionesses on this island have different tongues,' you think. The rubbing seems to cause the lioness to start salivating. You move yourself forward to the tip of her tongue, but you fall a pool of warm saliva in her tongue bed. The tongue now rests on your back, and you're now facing the back of her teeth and gums. You're curious to discover what they feel like, so you do so. Her teeth and gums are wet and smooth. You decide to rest on your back, letting the tongue cover your chest. You squeeze and hug the tongue, bathing yourself in her sweet drool. Everything is wet, dark, and warm. You begin to forget that you're stuck in her maw. However, the lioness is tired of waiting for you to trip and fall into her throat. She decides to finally do something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe...</span></div></div>",

You might've just gotten your lucky break! \"Well, you have me.\" You say, trying to convince her. \"I can't defend myself here, so I'd depend on you to feed and protect me, so I wouldn't run away... and you'd get a mate out of it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls around you start vibrating slightly due to the purring the girl does as she's thinking. \"Uh, you might want to hurry though, before I turn into mush!\" You say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the world around you gets tight and starts rising, then you're blinded by a bright light, and feel air blowing across your slightly burned skin. When you can see again, you're on the beach, and the lion-girl is sitting in front of you, looking you right in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" she says standing up, \" you make a good point. It's helpful to both of us, and if I ever get bored of you, I can always just eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that last part didn't ring so well with you, you're just glad to not be on the immediate menu.

Wait, wait for me!\" You yell, chasing after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes about an hour to get there (mostly from you tripping over stuff and slowing the pace down). It's a small cave, with about 3 chambers including the entry one. Oddly enough it has furniture, which you assume came from the wrecked ship you saw before you ran into Mimi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get lunch,\" Mimi says, walking toward the entrance. \"Stay inside, and don't come out.\" She adds with a growl as she passes you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't appear that she's too happy about your arrangement, but you couldn't care less. You're alone! You could attempt escape, or you could do like she says and wait up for her.

In what you assume to be the bedroom, a large luxrary grade bed is there, in surprisingly good condition. Except that all the tall posts on it have been scratched down to practically nothing. There are also two chairs in the room, though they in much worse condition, one looking as though it will collapse if you so much as breathe on it. There is a shard of a large mirror here, well, you assume that's what it's piece of, since it's still large enough to use as a full body mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second room you assume is the bathroom, because well, it has a toilet in it. You don't examine this one long, due to hearing Mimi's growl and a plop somewhere behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you walk over to her, she grabs you tightly and thrusts yourself onto you in a tight lip-lock. Her long tongue explores your mouth and you attempt to do the same with hers, but something blocks your progress. Something that feels like...meat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to break the embrace, but her hold is too tight, and you have no choice but to accept the pre-chewed meat into your mouth and swallow it. After that she lets go of you, and walks over to her kill like everything was normal. You however, think this is anything but normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?!\" You ask, obviously shocked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"That was lunch.\" Mimi answers causually. \"You said you needed me to feed you, and I have. Just like my mother used to feed me.\" She says, ripping meat off the now un-identifible animal and swallowing it. \"Did you want more?\" She asks, before ripping off another chunk of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm alright...\" You begin, but are interrupted by another embrace from Mimi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense! You must be full!\" And with that, she locks lips again, shoving her already chewed food into your gullet. You at first found it quite disturbing, but this time, it's surprising comforting. As you think this you realize Mimi is cradling you! She slowly rocks you back and forth motherly, and rasies your head to her breast! Naturally, you start to suck on it, unleashing a flow of milk! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you suckle on her breast, gulping down the milk, you start to get sleepy, from the rocking and being full. Before you know it, you're out like a light...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you awaken you're in the bed, embraced by Mimi. Your stirring causes her to awake as well. She purrs as she rubs your hair. \"Morning tiger. Are you ready for today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What happens today?\" You ask, still groggy from sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today's the day....</span></div></div>",

Then giving a precious kiss on her pearl, causing her to jump from the feeling. And licking her insides to get the juices flowing, hearing her give a growl of pleasure. And finally getting to the heavier stuff of sticking his tongue in as far as it will go and flicking it up and down, the lioness panting in pure ecstasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough *pant* foreplay hot stuff. Get to the real fun.\" \"Hold on, seeing the fun you just had, has made me hard. So before he fucks you, he'll be pleasuring me.

Turning around, the father is semi-hard, so Jaedon drops down and starts sucking the cock, while fondling his furry balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, that feels good human, keep at it\" With permission from the father, Jaedon continues on, since the father is a massive 12 feet tall and rippling with muscles. Leaving his cock a full 12\"long and very fat. 'If be fucks me with no mercy, he might kill me' Jaedon continues until the father says \"Enough, its time to fuck.\" The lioness lays down on her back, ready to go. Jaedon gets on top of her, ready to go.

But bigger than the last human I ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father does the fucking, starting off slow and getting faster. Jaedon doesn't even need to move himself, because the lion is moving with such force that he's got everything covered. Faster and faster, the father goes. Until its inhumanly fast, Jaedon is moaning, while the father and daughter are growling savagely. From the speed Jaedon comes first, causing the lioness to gasp in ecstasy and the father finishes by bringing his cock all the way out and slamming it back in, including his knot. After a few minutes everyone has stopped cumming \"This human is very good, father can we keep him?\" \"Actually daughter I'm...\"</span></div></div>",

Licking over your salty skin, and swallowing your head into his tight throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucking you in further, slathering your stomach in saliva, he takes another swallow. Stopping at your waist he slips his tongue out and starts to lick your dick, making you hard again. He then moves his tongue to your anal hole and starts to lick his cum, thats still oozing out. Moaning at yours and his taste, he swallows you again bringing your ads into his mouth, where he starts to tongue-fuck you. After a few minutes, you can't hold it and blow another load in his mouth, which he laps at greedily. He swallows again, leaving your knees to your feet, sticking out of his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slurps your legs inside and swallows again, leaving your feet in his mouth. Giving them a final taste, the lion swallows you down. You enter his stomach and are forced to curl into a fetal position, trying to turn yourself upright. You start to thrash around, hoping to get out \"Mmm that feels good human. You also filled me very well. My stomach has never looked so big. Enjoy being digested.\" A few minutes pass and you feel your feet tingle, thrashing around one final time, in hopes of escaping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours have passed and the human has been completely digested, leaving the lion very full for the rest of the day. \"You know daughter, I heard that human, while he was at the beach say something about finding his mate and friends.

We may not find this cave again. It's getting rather dark in here.\" She adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you expect,\" yells Jaedon cringing at her stupidity \"No light can get in there.

With a good chuck of the brush out of the way, he can clearly see that he was right to be worried about entering that opening. The opening turns out to be the mouth to a dragon!

He would rather not get eaten, but at least Sarah and Ben are still alive, good. Than he has an idea. It's insane, but it would solve three problems at once. He likes those kinds of plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peeks around the tree and says, \"Excuse me, Mr. Dragon. I'm 95% sure you can understand me. Clearly you only ate Sarah then and there because you knew I wasn't going to climb in after her. I told her that, so I'm guessing that you heard it and therefore can understand me. I have a deal for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon seems to pause and listen, though it's hard to being a dragon and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaedon gulps and continues, \"I'm sure you get hungry a lot. Being a dragon must mean you need to eat often. So I have this offer for you. Give me back my friends and I'll tell you were a whole village of good food is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon considers it then, at last, speaks in a low rumble, \"That's an interesting offer you have to make. I would love to devour a whole village. It would keep me full for a while sense my digestion is slow. Then I wouldn't have to hunt for a while. How do I know you know of such a village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" says Jaedon \"I can start by describing them to you. They look like a cross between cats and lions. They hate water and- \" At that moment Jane (Catithica's friend that was keeping an eye of Jaedon for her), comes running out of the new tree line and yells, \"There's no such village. If you want to eat you're going to have to eat him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon eyes her, realizing that her being here proves Jaedon's story. The dragon regurgitates Ben and Sarah. Then, as Jane has a disgusted look on her face, the dragon picks her up with it tail and tosses her high in the air. She screams the whole way up, and the whole way down into the dragons open mouth. It swallows and says, \"So you were telling the truth after all. Tell me where to find the rest of the delicious foods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaedon thinks to himself 'I guess she should have been a crossbreed between a human and a bird, not a cat.' What he says is \"Straight that way than up the coast. Flying you probably could cut some time off, but I don't know if you could find it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon flies off to eat Catithica and the rest of her village as Jaedon goes over the three problems he had solved: He had saved his friends, didn't get eaten himself, and now he doesn't have to worry about being chased by those cat people again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they have to decide what to do next. They still need to find Emily, Becky and Lee. Also, they need to find a way off this island and possible return Sarah's sanity.</span></div></div>",

The dragoness lowers her head to ground level and opens her jaws wide, right infront of your face. You are faced with rows of razor sharp teeth, a wide long tongue and at the back, you see the entrance to her throat, all covered in saliva, waiting to savor you. She points a claw at her mouth, gesturing you to enter. You slowly proceed to clamber into her mouth, carefully avoiding the rows of sharp teeth. You climb onto her tongue and kneel on it, facing toward the entrance to her mouth. The dragoness slowly closes her mouth, the last you would ever see of the outside world. Now fully closed you can still see surprisingly well. You feel that dragioness get up as she savors your taste, swishing you around her mouth with her tongue. Your hard cock rubs up against her tongue, sending pleasure to your brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm\" mumbles the dragoness as she continues tonguing you. Rubbing up against your solid member, throbbing almost reaching climax. She lifts you up and squashes you against the roof of her mouth, pinning you there and causing you to unload your seed all over her tongue. In full ecstasy, you almost forget where you are for a second before the dragoness tilts her head back, causing you to slide to the back of the throat. Survival instincts kick in as you try to stop yourself from falling, but the dragoness swallows hard, sending you into her gullet. You are a very tight fit inside the dragons throat, as your cock rubs past her walls. Powerful contractions send you further and further down, covering you in saliva, lubricating your journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you plop into the stomach and splash into her digestive juices. You lay there waiting for the inevitable, hoping that it wont hurt. A minuite or so passes as your skin starts to tingle, her powerful enzymes beginning to break down your flesh. The tingleing soon turns into searing pain as the juices seep deep into your skin. You flail around in pain causing the stomach to react and churn you around, slamming you against the walls of the stomach, oozing out digestive juices into your face. After a few minuets of churning you are too weak to resist and just let her body take control. You continue sloshing around as you start to feel the first pieces of your body break apart. You start to slip out of consciousness as your body starts to break up. The last thing you feel is an almighty tug as the exit to the stomach pulls you into the dragon's intestines, tearing you apart and you pass away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness, satisfied with her meal goes to sleep it off.

Look what I found,\" he said proudly, raising the man up by the rope off the ground, pointing at the dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you liked hunting dear, that is a sacrifice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not picky,\" he laughed and then looked at you, \"not hungry are you?

You see a bulge moving! The man was still alive, though, not for long. A few minutes later, the writing inside him stopped and the male dragon moved into his bedroom cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness looks down at you as she keeps you pressed against her belly, the gurgling slightly louder after the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That didn't look so bad, did it?\" She questions to you but you don't have the words to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strokes you softly. \"I'm kind of hungry now. I'm going to eat you sooner or later. I do think a pet would be fun however, so I'll let you deceide. Do you wish to be my meal now and get it over with or stay as my pet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to be a bit sympathetic towards you but still had no intention to let you go, you find yourself thinking about being digested inside the belly you are pressed against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it hurt?\" You ask, still thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends. If you relax, the lack of air inside my stomach will make you fall asleep before I digest you, struggle though and you will feel your body being broken down for food till the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither sounds preferrable to getting out alive, but you have to make a decision.</span></div></div>",

You're no longer human, but a dragon.

In fact, my mate should be returning with one of your ex-fellows within the hour.\" The minutes passed, you still struggling to come to grips with what has happened to you, when suddenly the male winged his way back into the cave, a human held tight in his claws.

Or, if you refuse, I'll rip her in half, and force feed you.

Bt then the dragon side of your mind, the side that was rapidly gaining dominance the longer you lived in this form, surged forward and crushed all trace of the human side of your mind. Looking at Becky, you let out a low hungry growl and slowly lick her face with your tongue, causing her to scream even more as she realizes you're not going to let her go. You lift her up, towards your fang-lined maw, and let her see exactly where she is going to end up. Your licking becomes more urgent, letting the taste of her wash over your mouth, a prelude to the feast to come. You slowly move her forward, until her head is inside your mouth, and then push your head forward, until you feel her head at the back of your mouth. You pause for a moment, allowing her to savor the last sight she will see, and then push your head forward, while simultaneously lifting her up, pushing her head into you throat. Her screams instantly become muffled as your throat eagerly engulfs her head and upper body, and you let your tongue slide down underneath her shirt and then her bra, slowy feeling each breast, before suddenly flexing it's powerful muscles, ripping both her shirt and bra down the front, causing them to fall to the ground as your throat muscles began to lift her further off the ground and deeper into your gullet. She was still fighting hard, but it was futile now, her shoulders had already slipped into your throat, and her breasts were now in your mouth, your tongue winding against them, feeling each nipple harden, even though she must not want them to. Her taste was incredible, easily the greatest thing you have ever had, especially considering you hadn't eaten anything in nearly ten months. After thoroughly tasting each breast, your tongue slid further down to wind around her stomach and back, gripping her tightly and pulling back into your mouth, lifting about another two feet of her into your mouth and throat, her breasts entering your throat with a muffled pop, and making a visible bulge in your scales. Her struggles were becoming less vigorous, and the dragoness, who had until this point remained silent witness, spoke up, \"With your next swallow, remember to gulp down some air, or she'll die before she reaches your stomach.\" With a slight nod, you acknowledge her instruction, and when you feel the next muscle wave building, you lift Becky's body with your tongue, and inhale a burst of air. You feel it travel down your throat and reach her head, and her struggles immediately resume, much to the amusement of the dragoness and you pleasure, since you certainly did not want this to end prematurely. As her lower body slid into your mouth, your tongue found and began to explore her lower regions. Her screams and struggles of terror began tochange to moans of pleasure, and you felt one of her arms wiggle it's way back up your throat to join your tongue. You fel you lips curl back from your teeth in a draconic smile, and you held onto her legs to keep her in your throat as you continued to pleasure her. Finally, she hit her peak and screamed in pleasure into the moist walls of your throat, while you murred in near identical pleasure at the flood of her own fluids flowing down your throat into your stomach, which began growling louder, eager for it's turn to experience Becky. With a mental sigh, you released your grip on her legs and withdrew your tongue. Enough of her body had entered your gullet that you could lift your head and let gravity start to help. You nod your head slighty and another foot of her long and delicious legs slid into your throat. As her legs slid into your throat, you felt her head pushing into your stomach, and her struggles starting to resume as her pleasure induced fog began to dissipate, and realization of where she was gripped her mind in it's ice cold fingers. However, by this point in time, it was useless to try to escape, and as she came to this conclusion, she gave up and simply let your body do what it knew to do. Slowly, you wrapped your tongue around her feet and pulled them into your mouth, winding your tongue around each toe playfully, then pulling them both to the back of your mouth. Pausing for a moment, you let her lay there, head in your stomach and the rest of her body making a well-shaped bulge in your throat. After a second or two, you closed your mouth, cutting off her feeling of the cool air outside your mouth, and then swallowed hard, sending her body down your throat to join her head. As she finished her journey, the bulge in your throat rapidly shrunk, replaced by a swelling bulge in your gut. As you contentedly laid down on your side, you began to hear noises coming from your bulging stomach. Craning your head closer, you realized that the noise was Becky crying and saying something. \"Why, Jaedon? How could you do this to me?\" Reaching into her mind, as well as gulping a mouthful of air so she can remain conscious, you put an image of yourself as a human, then showed your outline blurring and transforming into a dragon, with no trace of your humanity left to hinder you. You hear a new bout of crying and then Becky said, \"I can't accept that. I know that there's something of you, deep down, you're still Jaedon.\"</span></div></div>",

Now pinned, all you can do is stare into his hate filled eyes as his maw opens up before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabs you by the head with his teeth, pulling your body into his mouth, ripping your arms off and leaving them underneath his claws.

The last thing you see is his mighty tooth coming straight down at you. Before his giant fang penetrates right through the centre of your head, killing you instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon proceeds to chew, turning your body into a mushy, bloody mixture. He savors your taste for a moment before tilting his head back and leading your remains to slide easily down his throat. What was left of your body travels down his gullet slowly, powerful muscular contractions helping you along the way. Before long, you enter the stomach in a heap of blood, bones and meat. Your remains make a splash as they fall into his digestive juices. The dragons stomach start to churn as it breaks apart what is left of you, leaving the finally result a barely recognizable mushy pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours pass as the dragon rests in his cave. Patting his belly, fully satisfied with his meal. Your digested remains enter his anal canal as you are ready to see the outside world once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon gets up and walks into a chamber located inside the cave. This chamber is filled with the dragons previous meals remains and would smell awful to anyone else. He bends over a pile of previously laid out shit and starts to squeeze your remains out of his butthole. Slowly, your poopy self squeezes out of his hole, curling up on top of another pile of shit. The dragon walks off without a second thought for his victim. You remain in the chamber for all eternity, as a dragons meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A shape seems to get closer to the surface, and suddenly, plunges out, all around you. With her mouth open impossibly wide, she swallows you down to her stomach in one quick motion, leaping from the water and coming back down with a splash. The cute redhead lays lazily in the water, patting the rather large buldge you make in her fish half. Giggling, Eeilin comes over and rubs the buldge you make in Geala. \"So, what does the chatty thing called a human taste like?\" She asks, looking curiously at her friends expression. The red head pats her tummy and licks her lips, \"Delicious. It's even better than calamari. Oh, and it wiggles once it's in your tummy too.\" They both watch in delight as you wriggle in her tummy, causing noticeable buldges and movement in her fish like torso. For you, it isn't so fun, as it smells like rotten fish all around you, and this stingy liquid is pouring in all around you, causing your clothes to dissolve away in her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her hand rubbing Geala's tummy, Eeilin feels every kick and squirm you make. \"Wow. Poor little guy, it must really be unpleasant in their for him.\" She says with anusement. Geala speaks up, giving you a rough pat, \"Don't worry,  I'll digest him pretty quickly, his skin doesn't seem to have anything remarkable about it.\" Indeed, she does digest you pretty quickly, and give out a loud cry as her stomach compacts all around you, acids seeping into your flesh and digesting you. Soon you are a lifeless lump pushing through her intestines. \"So, how was he. Did he digest without any complications?\" Eeilin asks. Geala nods, and lifting her tail up, she gives a strained grunt. \"Ung.. see for yourself!\" Suddenly,a couple small, compact, round turds are squeezed from her ass, sinking down to the sea floor. They seem to be a healthy brown in color. \"Ahh.. yea, he was great. We have to get more of these things.\" She says, and the two of them swim off, the red head leaving a small trail of yellow in the water as she pisses out your excess liquids. Congradulations, you are now one of a numerous amount of round, brown turds dotting the sea floor. Aren't you proud of yourself? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour species soon becomes actively hunted by the Durwuu, and the begin to lay out elaborate traps all over the world, using their equivelant to a fishing rod to bring humans from the land to the water. Soon the ocean takes on a murky greenish brown color from the number of humans that became dung, and the Durwuu raise what little is left of humanity in small bubbles in their underwater cities. No human remains left above the surface of the water, as the elaborate traps bring them to the verge of extiction, only the ones farmed in air bubbles by the Durwuu surviving. The human race has become reduced to being food for the Durwuu, and you are remembered in what little lore humans keep as the one who brought them a taste of human flesh. At least you won't be lonely, as you have lots of putrid, round turds that had once been your fellow humanity all around you, stinking up the waters. </span></div></div>",

NEXT TIME I'LL HAVE YOU MARINATED FIRST...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext time? Wondering what she is talking about, just like those strange words about feeding her forever, you try to figure the mystery out as the digestion acids start to rise in her stomach and soaks you while it starts to burn off first the seaweed, then your clothes and lastly your skin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, you never died whilst being digested. Although you felt every painful step of it, just when you thought you were going to die a while light flashed through the stomach and you found yourself lying panting outside Undine's belly on the floor while the Queen looked down on you with a huge smile on her huge lips before scooping you up again with a vicious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this has been how you have spent your days ever since; bound in tight seaweed and stored in the kitchen of the palace whenever outside Undinde's belly, only to be eaten every day. Sometimes she simply swallows you whole like the first time, sometimes she cooks you in some way first, but it always ends in you being reborn again and being taken to the kitchen to be prepared for the next meal. Undine has the power to keep you alive forever, and as long as she loves the taste of you she intends to keep you as her favourite snack.</span></div></div>",

You paused for another long moment, just staring dumb-founded at the creature, she was just waiting in front of you, flicking her violet hair back. Her human half was completly nude and her snake half was at least 9 metres long of gorgeous violet scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes... what are you?\" You squirmed backwards trying to gain your footing and get up as you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know?

Her breasts rubbed against you as she got into position next to you, distracting you whilst part of her snake body coiled on top your legs slightly. \"We don't get many new people here.\" She smiled again and rubbed your sides, whilst letting your head rest on her other arm.</span></div></div>",

My belly is a soft and warm, cozy place. I'm sure you'd like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea how to react, should you run? Reason with her? You tried the latter for now. \"I.. I'm ok here thanks, please don't.\" You plead, beginning to shake, frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans here know nagas are superior, most worship us along with a few crazy gods. Feeding us is considered a great honour, I'm sure I could show you that.\" She came up closer to you and slid around your back leaving the coil from her waist behind you and her human half higher up, your head at breast height, the coil felt soft and smooth on your back and the voluptuous breasts she had are a more than pleasant sight to see up close. You couldn't focus on them now though, she was raised above you and you felt she might take your head into her mouth at any second.</span></div></div>",

Now is there any way I could convince you to change your mind?\" She giggled cutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was asking if she could eat you again, at first you had screamed no but now... it felt different, as she waited your reply you felt her press against you, her skin was sentual to the touch and you could hear her stomach rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" She asked, \"may I eat you, human?\" She stared into your eyes, you felt hypnotised and a few seconds later you nodded to confirm your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, remove your clothing, you won't need them where you're going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had her coil loosen from around you and still you looked into her eyes as you dropped your clothing, piece by piece into a pile next to the two of you, leaving you totally naked. After you finished she wrapped back around you as you resumed to kneel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips then lowered till her head was just above yours, she tilted your head up and licked across your face slowly with her forked tongue, you closed your eyes and suddenly felt her warmth encompas your head as she licked it still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands moved up and gave a slight push on her shoulders, it would be your last resistance and a weak one that she barely felt before having her own hands soothe your arms and then pin them gently to your sides as she gulped down your head that had now entered her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted you up slightly, pushing you up onto her coil as you sat on it now, limp and giving no more effort in stopping her. She lifted you into her mouth and her tongue pulsated under you as it tasted the flesh that entered. She quickly had your chest between her lips and then soon your upper torso was inside of her, forming a large bulge down her throat and showing in her human belly as you slipped down further, entering the snake half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer soft femenime hands lifted you up now, pushing on your butt till it was far enough in for her to use your legs to do the same. Your waist was guided past her lips and her tongue teased you for the moment she held it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith most of your body inside she effortlessly slipped your legs in and her tongue gave one last lick to savour you before she reached a finger in and pushed your foot down whilst taking a big gulp, sealing your fate behind her ruby lips which she closed shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was now pushed down by strong muscles and it filled out her snake half with a very visible human shaped bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny turned to face the bulge and stroked softly on it as it slid down untill it came to a rest in her stomach where you would stay untill digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum,\" She smiled, licking a finger or two clean of your taste, \"ahh, nice and full, thankyou human. Rest now and wait, it won't be long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her stomach you were still quite limp, you could feel her acids begin to seep in and her stomach churn around you and fill with loud gurglings. They tingled your skin as they began the process of turning you into a nutritious soup for the Naga. You writhed a little, the pain was fierce but the parts that melted away quickly became numb to the point you could feel as they seeped underneath your skin and digesting your flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Destiny curled up next to your bulge, she rested her head on a coil and lay at the side stroking it. You moaned out in pain a little and she shushed you quietly, \"shhhh, that's it, good meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after your life was overcome by her digestive juices and churning of her stomach, her belly settled down but still gurgled softly as it worked on your remains. Destiny slept as the churning sounds soothed her to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst she slept the bulge in her stomach started to fade away, what she could use was processed through her body and what left, taken further down through her system. She woke up feeling full and refreshed, she smiled seeing that her stomach had done it's job and then closed her eyes once more to take a short nap before starting her day to see what awaited her next.</span></div></div>",

I'm trapped by this really nasty plant with vines. Help me!.\" You again try to tug at the vines grasping at your legs, but this time they wrap around your arms too, leaving you with no free limbs. It's bulbous head begins to open, dripping yellow goo and covered with vicious spike like objects. As it begins pulling yo in, you let out one last scream, \"Destiny? Heeeelp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Slithering casually out of the shrubbery comes Destiny a faint look of disappointment on her face, mixed with a sad smile. \"Oooh, a venus man snatcher. Tough luck, my little morsel, looks like you've been snagged by one of the more vicious, and painful, predators of this island.\" Her voice is still overly charming, and you can't help but squeel in panic as you are dragged closer to those menacing petals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Please, Destiny, don't let it end like this. Please. Help me!\" You cry, your bound and helpless form less than a yard away from the ravenous, drooling maw of the hungry plant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Destiny runs her hand across your face, and steals a fair well kiss on your lips. \"It's a pity, really. I would have enjoyed having the warm body of a foreign traveler trapped in my belly. As much as I love the tough, tangy flavor of the natives, it has been a long time since a sweet, delicate piece of meat like you, came along. The portal to this island only open's every hundred years for the next group of heroes. Needless to say, you aren't the one destined to free this island either.\" She gives your cheek one last tender pinch, then slithers back to watch your helpless plight. \"I'm afraid it's the code of the predator not to interfere with another's catch here on this island. Do not worry though, I will be sure and dispose of your friends before they meet a fate similar to yours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You can only let out one last cry before the vicious plant pulls you into it's  jaws, the hot, venomous drool singeing your skin on contact, causing you to gasp in pain, right before the spiney jaws clamp shut over your form. The vine's slip away just before the jaws shut, and with a leafy shuffle, the maw of the plant closes completely around you. The slender, needle like hairs of the creature pierce your skin, the viscious, yellowish fluid pouring into your veins, causing unimaginable pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Over the next several hours, the liquid turns from yellow to red as your body turns from a solid to a liquid. For you, it was the most painful ten minutes of your life, as the needle like hairs from the maw extended into you, injecting their bile inside you, melting your lungs, heart, and other vitals in just under an hour. From outside, Destiny watches your plight until your squirms stop, then slithers away, hoping to snag one of your friends. You, however, met a fate that few men can ever claim. You became the core nutrients to a plant that turn your living flesh into so much soup. The gnarled bones it spits out only six hours later don't even resemble human bones. For you, your only accomplishment in life was to add another dozen leaves to the neck of a sadistic, vile plant form.</span></div></div>",

As you focus on that, you feel yourself getting turned on, and Destiny smiles as she sees your penis geting hard. She then lays down and beckons you to her. As you walk closer, you see a reddish slit opening about where a human female's vagina would be. You lie down on top of her and slide your penis into her, and realize that you barely take up any room in there. Destiny looks down at it, then meets your eyes and says, \"hmmm... since you don't seem quite up to it, why don't you stick your feet in there\" Puzzled by this, but realizing that if she doesn't hit an orgasm, it's going to be a lot more than you feet that will be inside her, you pull youself out, slide down onto the sand beside her, and bring your feet up and slowly begin to insert them into her vagina. This has a much more immediate effect, as Destiny's eyes roll back slighty and she starts moaning in pleasure, \"More, more, that feels so much better than your first attempt.\" You obey and slide your ankles in, then you calves, suprised at how much of your legs are fitting inside her. After you reach your knees, you begin to wiggle your feet around and move your legs slightly. As you do this, Destiny's moaning becomes more fevered, and you begin to feel her vagina rythmically conracting around your legs. As Destiny's moaning reaches it peak, she suddenly scream in orgasm, and the vaginal contractions become so strong they actually suck you in upto your waist. As you both lie there, panting from the exertion, Destiny looks over at you and smiles softly, \"Test passed\" she says, \"you are worthy\" Before you can ask her what she means, you suddenly feel her vagina begin contracting on your lower body again, only this time it seems to be crushing them together. It starts to hurt, and as you begin to yell, Destiny puts a hand over your mouth and holds you around the shoulders wih the other. \"Shsssh, my dear, it'll all be over soon....\" As the pain reaches unbearable levels and you hear your more delicate leg bones beginning to break, you pass out and fall into unconciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAftter an indeterminate amount of time, during which your dreams are disjointed and confusing, but always being predominently about Destiny, you wake to to see that the sun has fallen to almost touching the horizon. You look around and see the jungle, the beach, everything from the waist down protruding from Destiny's vagina. At that sight, you cry out and struggle to free yourself, only your legs don't seem to work, they must've broken under the pressure of whatever she did. As you continue to stuggle, you feel a hand on your shoulder and look up into Destiny's eyes, which, instead of the usual faintly predatorial look that you remember, are now looking at you with a sense of pride. \"Congratulations, Jaedon, you survive yet again. According to my father, not many humans do.\" You look at her in confusion, \"Survive what?\" She smiles at you and says, \"See for yourself.\" And you feel her vagina begin to contract again, this time pushing you out. As you look down, what you see horrifies you. Instead of your normal legs sliding out, you see foot after foot of snake body sliding out. The realization hits you, she didn't simply want you to service her, she was turning you into one of her. As the lest of your body slides onto the sand, you look yourself over. Your lower body is now 9 meters of snake body, just like Destiny, only your scales are a brilliant shade of blue. You try to move, and after a feww attempts, manage to wiggle your tailtip. After that, moving the rest of the body quickly becomes natural, and you look at Destiny. \"Why did you do this?\" you ask. She looks a little bit sh, but says,\" Well, after you managed to escape me, it was something that I had never had happen to me before. I couldn't figure out how you did it, barring that for your species, you are a rare individual. That's why, when I saw you had returned to the beach, the thought occurred to me to make you one of us. Obviously, my other thought was to simply eat you out of spite, but I believe that if your able to beat one of the best predators in the area, then you should join them. Was I right, Jaedon? Do you want to be one of the predators, for once? You can stay here, and if you're willing, I will be your mate...\" She looks at you hopefully, and you decide</span></div></div>",

You and Destiny raised many broods of nagas together, and eventually, through feeding on the scattered human tribes as well as the other natives, you gained dominance over the entire island.

Yes, she has the body of a snake from the hips down, but for some reason you find yourself oddly attracted to her. Maybe it were her exotic, emerald green eyes with their slit pupils, and how they seem to sparkle in the sun? Maybe it were her full, kissable lips and how they curled when she smirked? Maybe, and most likely it were her large, heaving, bare breasts, or her wide, curvy hips? Still, this snake-woman just assumes that you would jump at the opportunity to bang her. Does she really think that she's that hot? She must think that she's God's gift to men, or something. The conceited bitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Destiny's eyes looking you up and down as she awaits your answer. That familiar sly smirk on her face. She looks as if she already knows what your response will be, that you'll want her. Attractive or not, you always hated when people had unduly high opinions of themselves. Confidence is one thing, but overly prideful people always bugged you, and you feel the urge to bring Destiny down a few pegs. \"The honor of pleasuring you?\" You repeat out loud. With a grin Destiny simply nods her head, and chuckles. \"Don't <i>we</i> have a high opinion of ourselves?\" You ask mockingly. Destiny frowns in response. \"You're not that beautiful, lady,\" you begin, \"even if you were, what makes you think I'd want to touch you?\" You ask. Destiny's lower jaw suddenly drops in surprise. You were feeling bold, maybe due to you taking down that carnivorous plant? Whatever the reason, you felt the urge to keep hurling insults. \"Yeah, that's right\", you start, \"you're not that hot,\" you continue, \"you have burlap skin, saggy breasts, and you're kind of fat--get over yourself!\" Of course you didn't really mean any of what you just said, you just wanted to wound her pride a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny then gasps, and goes wide-eyed, her mouth agape. She's staring at you in disbelief. \"Fat?\" She utters to herself in a low, hurt tone. A moment or two go by as she speechlessly gazes at you. \"How dare you speak to me in such away\", she begins, a shocked expression on her face, \"HOW DARE YOU?!\" she suddenly shrieks. You begin to think that you may have gone a bit too far, and by the pissed look on her face you know you're right. Acting quickly, you vault over Destiny's tail which she had loosely encircled around you, and not a moment too soon as she suddenly tightens her coils not even a second after you jumped out of them. However, she was quick to react and swings her powerful, heavy tail, smacking you square in the back. The blow was so strong that the wind is knocked out of you and you're sent flying for a few meters. You land hard on your stomach, groaning in pain. \"Yeah,\" you begin in agony, \"definitely went too far.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called me fat\", you hear Destiny growl from behind, \"<i>I</i> am NOT fat!\" Remembering the angry naga, You get it together enough to roll onto your back. You see Destiny slowly slithering towards you, she's raised up to her full height, easily two heads taller than you. Her hands are at her sides in tightly balled fist. The look on her face is...frightening. Her teeth are bared, and clenched, you notice her sharp, well developed canines. You see her eyes. They are practically shooting you with daggers. Man, if looks could kill. \"You're going to pay for what you said, human\", Destiny begins in a cold voice, still advancing towards you, \"oh, you're going to pay!\" You can practically taste the murderous intent she has for you. You didn't think she would be this angry, you expected her to be upset, sure, but she's practically hysterical. Apparently the self conscious woman stereotype carries across species barriers. Destiny's only a few feet away now. You quickly roll onto your feet and bolt off in the opposite direction. You look back over your shoulder to see Destiny abruptly lunge at you and just barely miss. She quickly gets up and kicks it into overdrive as she follows in pursuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back here!\" She screams after you. As you haul ass across the beach, you remember watching a documentary on TV back home about snakes. What most people fail to realize is that the bigger a snake gets the slower it gets. Anacondas, and boas for example are pretty slow. They have to ambush they're prey. However their striking lunge is what you have to look out for. It's lighting fast. You were hoping that nagas would be similar to actual snakes in that regard(slow in pursuit, but fast on the draw), and if they are Destiny didn't get that memo because she sure isn't slow. You can hear her panting. She's mere seconds behind you! She's too far to jump you from behind, but close enough that the slightest stumble from you would mean game over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait until I get my hands on you--you're dead!\" Destiny shouts. \"Look I'm sorry,\" you begin, looking back over you're shoulder, \"I didn't mean it.\" You see her furious face. She's really tearing through the sand. \"No, you're not sorry,\" Destiny starts, \"but you will be!\" You have no idea where you're running to, you hadn't thought that far ahead. The beach appears to go on for a while, and there's no real cover. You wont be able to outrun Destiny like this for much longer. A thought crosses your mind. It's risky, but you see no other option. You come to an abrupt stop, and just as abruptly spin to your left and then out before reversing direction. As expected, Destiny lunged at you as soon as you stopped, but she didn't expect that display of fancy footwork, and instead went sailing past you, and into to the sand, missing by inches. You hurdle over her tail, as she tries to trip you up with her long body, and keep moving. \"Man, I should have went out for football.\" You say to yourself, impressed by the juke you just pulled off. Now you're heading back towards the woods. You already had a near death experience in there but, you figure that you'll last longer there than out in the open with a enraged snake chick chasing you. Besides, Destiny seemed reluctant to enter the forest before, maybe you'll be able to loose her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over your shoulder and see Destiny getting up. She must have hit the ground hard because she seems to be moving slowly. You have some distance between you and her, but she's already coming after you again, and madder than ever. Predators don't like it when their prey make them look bad you assume. After a short while you reach the threshold of the the forest and  make your way inside, keeping an eye out for man-eating plants, and other nasty critters this time. After a while you notice that you've gone deeper into the forest than you did before. You stop running and look back, and are surprised to see Destiny. She actually followed you into the forest! She must really be mad to overcome her fear. She does seem to be having trouble getting over tree roots, and through the dense foliage however. \"Thank God she doesn't have legs.\" You think. Destiny sees you and gives you an evil glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you notice that some of vines seem to be grabbing hold of Destiny. She starts struggling against them, and as she does you see more appear and ensnare You see her being pulled off to her left. With your eyes, you follow where these vines lead and are surprised to see another one of those plants, similar to the one that almost ate you, but this one is HUGE! It make the one you fought off look like a baby. How did you run past that thing without noticing it earlier? Destiny sees this creature too and begins fighting even harder but to no avail. You see more vines wrap around her waist, her left arm, and one around her neck. The plant then opens up revealing it's moist interior, and Destiny starts screaming, as she's slowly dragged towards it. She then looks to you with pleading eyes. The earlier rage now gone. You're starting to feel real low. She wouldn't be about to die if you hadn't pissed her off. Although she <i>did</i> want to eat you so maybe she had this coming? Then again, she probably wouldn't have chased you into the forest if you didn't call her a saggy breasted fat-ass. You turn to run, but stop when suddenly Destiny calls out to you. \"Help me, human!\" She screams. You spin around towards her. She's crying now, tears streaming down her face. You know you should get the hell out of here, but Destiny is still a woman...sort of, and you always thought yourself a gentleman. You always did hate seeing a woman in trouble. \"Run or help\", you think to yourself \"run, or help?\" Destiny screams again. \"Human...Jaedon, help, PLEASE!\" She shrieks. You look to her, and see her thrashing to try and break free. This is probably the second time she's addressed you by name instead of by species. She really needs you! \"Damn my chivalrous ways!\" You shout. You take a moment to think before deciding to...</span></div></div>",

You decide to ignore it this time. After all it is a volcanic island. For all you know all caves are warm here. <br>\r\nAt least this will make me a warm resting place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to dig your way through what indeed appears to be a bundle of spider webs. As you expected the material easily gives way and allows you to step inside. To your amazement the web continues inside the cave at least several meters, anyway, as far as you can see in the dusky cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been a long time indeed since there was anything in here you figure. Good for me!.You walk a small 20-30 meters inside noticing the grounds bends downwards rather steeply. Also when you look up, you can no longer see the ceiling. Must be rather high in here you figure. All and all a large cave. Too large to explore any further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just decide to walk a few more meters to see if you can get yourselves out of the web that is still all around you. But the easiness it gave way at the entrance is being replaced with a more sticky behavior almost like walking through quicksand. It feels very soft and comfortable on your bare skin but it just won\u2019t let go.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a sec. Bare skin??  Where\u2019s my shirt gone then? Probably lost in the web. Its so darn hot in here, you didn\u2019t even notice. You decide to stay where you are and find the shirt tomorrow. First get rid of this sticky stuff you decide. Then take a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around to look for the entrance again but is has gone. The path you just dug through the web closed itself again. This is really starting to give you the creeps. That is not possible. All this stuff is still sticking on me! Where does I come from?<br>\r\nNext you become aware why that turning yourselves around while still engulfed in a spiders web is not such a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have wrapped yourself in. your face is almost completely covered in soft silky strains and by now you have big trouble moving in any direction. Yuck!. You start to pull yourselves free from the web and to some extend you are successful tearing it off. It must be at least a 5 inch layer. Incredible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your struggle you free yourself you step on a more firm wire. You freeze. Bad news you know when you hear something moving at the ceiling. The same moment you are struck by a ball of sticky loose silk at least a few meters diameter landing on top of you engulfing you completely. You immediate loose your balance and start to tumble down into the cave like a snowball gathering more and more web around you as you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like forever you softly come to a standstill when the webs are slowing you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you are completely immobilized helplessly awaiting your fate. You by now get a hunch what that might be and as on command a creature appears from the ceiling. You can vaguely see through your cocoon wall and see again a strange mixture-being. Like the snake on the beach on top she is a whole lot of woman, This one however is a bit chubby large breasts luscious lips and a silky brownish-black fur allover. Her behind is that of an enormous spider and of course eight legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHi there she whispers in a low sexy voice. How nice of you to drop by. I don\u2019t see many visitors here you know. I was getting so hungry that I almost decided to go outside for a hunt. But you know I do not like the exercise that much, so tiring you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell you can tell you think looking at her rather fat body. You try to speak to her but you find your mouth filled with web. You can only make some muffled sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t bother sweetie she whispers with her dark voice. Pleading will not help you anyway. The question you must ask yourselves now is am I hungry enough to eat you here on the spot or shall I cut you a bit loose and escort you to my den where we can have some fun before I eat you? You\u2019ll find me very creative in ways of pleasing and eating you. With that she digs in to the cocoon and sinks here fangs into your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream and think that\u2019s the end. She injected me with her digestive fluids. You already feel your body being eaten away. You trash around in the cocoon only to get more and more stuck in its soft silky embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t be silly you human. Its just a little something to make you calm so I can digest you a little more slowly when the time comes. I don\u2019t like to rush food you know. You indeed feel your panic fade and you start feeling reel comfortable in this soft fluffy cocoon and looking at your predator you notice in your embracement that your member becomes erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood! I like my prey willing and longing for my final bite when I devour it she says. Her voice now seems to caress your ears. Whatever she did to you, it works. You cannot help yourselves longing for her. You want to be dissolved in her body so badly it hurts. You want her to eat you now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now what shall I do to you my dear, she asks herself licking her lips. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

First, this stomach will marinate you in special juices, and then push you into my real stomach\". Upon hearing this, you try your best to escape, but to no avail. After about an hour, you are push into her spider half. Inside you don't feel the stinging of the acids, but you know they are coming. Outside, the spider lady rapped in the experience and knew that it will take at least 24 hours to completely digest you, so she decided to go for a walk. With her large spider belly, she knew that this was a perfect time to find dessert.</span></div></div>",

But then she looked down and saw something completely unexpected. Your erection grew to such a size, that it actually poked a hole in the cocoon, exposing a huge, throbbing and steaming phallus to the BBD (big, beautiful dridder). She moaned as she saw this, in arousal &amp;\u00a0disappointment. \"aww! If i eat you right now, it'll be such a waste! you just got me all wet!\" her vaginal passage began to seep her honey, and eventually gave into her carnal wishes. \"I'll tell you what, little snack. If you can please me sexually, I won't eat you to digest you, but if you fail... Let's just say you'll be mine alone, as my dinner!\" the dridder laughed, but the promise of sex snapped you out of your trance. You nodded at her proposition, and say \"I won't disappoint you, miss!\" the dridder laughed, smiled and said \"you can call me Deirdre, sugar! And I sure hope you won't, as I can be VERY hard to please. It better be worth my desires, or I'll digest you nice and slowly like the other hundred silly men who stumbled into my little abode! After all, I do wish to enjoy my food in my belly as long as i can, especially after I... play with it! *giggle*\" you moaned at Deirdre's words and nodded at her face. Deirdre smiled and said \"Good! Now come with me and let's get you out of my blankets, we don't wanna ruin them with our cum, now do we?\" you shake your head as she picks you up. \"Good boy! Now let's go, sugar! *Mwah!*\" Deirdre sensually kisses your lips as she skitters into the den with you, for the most dangerous love-making session you'll ever have!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0as you are carried into the den, Deirdre opens your cocoon and wipes you off. She giggles and says, \"and so it begins.\" She stretches her vaginal ring open, and you dive for it. Deirdre gasps as this sudden move, and experiences a pleasure she never felt before. You've only been inside her for eight seconds, but Deirdre feels that you have passed the test. \"Ah! Oh yes! Mmmmmm! I'm so glad I chose to spare you!\" Deirdre thought. You felt as if your crotch was about to melt, as Deirdre's crevice was seeping a quite powerful aphrodisiac onto your phallus, and with every thrust, the sensations were stronger and stronger. You begin to pant harder and harder as these sensations become too much. Deirdre sees your expression and locks her lips onto your own. As your tongues tango with each other's,\u00a0a single strain of thoughts came into the dridder's mind. \"his love feels so good! I want him to stay with me forever, as he's too yummy to give up. Oh! Yes! Finally! I have found my mate!!!\" as she finished her thought, the two of you erupted in a sexual firestorm. Deirdre screams into your mouth as her womb fills to its limit with your semen. You collapse into Deirdre's arms as she sat down, as you have lost all of your energy in your inhuman ejaculation (you shot enough sperm into Deirdre to fill an XL-sized water balloon to the point of popping it). Deirdre smiled at her newest toy, and whispered, \"you passed my test flawlessly. Congratulations. And now, your reward!\" She opened her mouth wide and swallowed you whole. You were too asleep to feel Deirdre eat you, and would not wake up until you were completely in her stomach! Patting her full spider belly, Deirdre giggled and said \"I'm gonna see what your love tastes like, sugar.\" Deirdre smiled, went into the kitchen. rubbed her gut, and began her nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Deirdre's gut rippled around your sleeping body, the acids began to cover your body. The gurgling and sloshing of Deirdre's full belly got louder and louder, as it tried to figure out what to do with you. This was the first time Deirdre ever had a human in her special gut. The sounds were nearly deafening, but they didn't wake you. you would only open your eyes when a drop of acid hits your forehead, and when you did, you began to flip out. You began to scream, as you feel the dridder you had sex with turned you into her tasty snack (by the island's standards). You began to pound on Deirdre's stomach walls, jolting her awake. \"And it seems my delicious darling has finally woken up. And just as my belly began to cuddle with him,\" you screamed in fear, as you felt a strong tingling sensation all around you. You continued to struggle for another three minutes, until you gave up hope. You started to cry, and Deirdre tried her best to comfort you. \"hush, sugar. I'm not gonna digest you like the other men. I'm just having dessert. I ate you, I will admit it, but now you're in a special part of my belly. You won't be hurt by me, and over time, your cum will fill me up. until I'm ready to make love to you again, sugar, my tummy will make sure you are happy. You began to calm down, as her words sounded so sweet. The tingling reached a chaotic and... erotic state and you began releasing a copious pool of semen into your fleshy cradle. Deirdre smiled as her tummy began to fill up. She could taste your semen as it entered her real stomach, and to her, it was rich and sweet. \"mmmmmm. Yummy. I wanna keep you inside me forever, sugar! but my tummy's almost full. You know what that means? It's Almost time to come out!\" you smiled at Deirdre's tenderness, and closed your eyes, saying, \"thank you!\" as your crotch released every last bit of sperm stored in your testes. Deirdre smiled contently, as she was stuffed. She rubbed her tummy, and let you out through her anus. Her real stomach digests everything, so there was no waste on your body, Deirdre smiled at your body, and wrapped her arms around you. You did the same, and she slept on top of you.</span></div></div>",

Tilting your head back as far as your paralysis would allow, you recognized the source as Becky, one of your friends.

It seemed her attention had faded from you, for the time being. The question was whether or not Destiny decided to devour you both or leave you alive.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cold, slimly scales of Destiny's serpentine tail tickle your back as it slithers around your body, entangling you in its powerful grip. The impossibly long appendage continues on, sliding over to Becky and giving her the same treatment. In a single fluid motion Destiny constricts her tail, squeezing the two of you together. Becky lets out a gasp as her tender nipples make contact with you, her hefty bosom now being squished against your muscular chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's not the only place you connect as you feel your eager cock slip inside her her moist sex, edging out a pleasure moan from the both of you. The wet warmth of her pussy wrapped around your cock is heavenly, completely wiping any worry your situation would have otherwise inspired. After a few seconds of this heaven, Destiny releases her grip, dislodging you from your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying ourselves, are we?\" Destiny jokes, wiping a bit of precum from the tip of your dick. \"I'm glad you're enjoying yourselves, 'cause that's the last thing you'll ever experience!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail tightens once again, slamming you and Becky together again. This time, though, Destiny uses her free hands to press your foreheads together. Unhinging her jaw for a third time, she finally begins her meal, bringing lowering her maw over the both of your foreheads. Strands of sticky saliva trail down your head as a moist darkness plunges over your eyes, but you don't care. Your predator was kind enough to continue the forced sex, squeezing and releasing you in a pleasurable rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an experienced Naga like herself, Destiny had little trouble devouring the two of you at once. With ease her ever-expanding jaws close around the pair of shoulders. The only challenge that presents itself is Becky's busty chest, but even those massive melons aren't enough to truly stop the beast. It isn't long before she makes it past and rockets down towards the waists. Your breathing becomes labored, not by the restriction of her throat, but because of the unabating pleasure of the sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky seems to be enjoying it even more than yourself, judging by her obnoxiously loud moans of pleasure. It isn't long before her lower body explodes in pleasure, her pussy clamping down in pure ecstasy. Unable to hold back yourself, you too come, coating her insides with your thick semen. The massive load leaks out, draining down the base of your cock. Even Destiny seems to have noticed as her dextrous tongue slithers in, lapping up that delicious juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite the amazing climax, nothing seems to change. Your cock is just as hard and Becky's sex is just as wet as they were before the two of you came. The potent venom coursing through your veins seems to be a lot stronger than you assumed. Not that you have long to think about it, though, as the rhythmic squeeze returns, drawing your attention away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that, Destiny manages to make it to the end, closing her jaw around the two pairs of feet. With a single gulp she swallows you down, sending the two of you on a short trip to her digestive chamber. Her human half bulges out as you pass through, finally settling in her serpentine lower half. It's hot, sticky, and just a light bit burning, but there thankfully seems to be just enough air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also happens to be incredibly cramped. The tight muscles of her stomach have the two of your pressed together like sardines in a can. Even better, your cock seems locked inside of her as there is absolutely no room for you to maneuver out of her. Not that either of you would want that, really. There's not much else to do in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Destiny smiles, observing her lower half. At a glance, her engorged stomach looked more pregnant than full. Running her hand on the bloated chamber, she could feel the distinct sensation as you slammed yourself against Becky. Muffled, pleasure gasps vibrated through her thin scales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a yawn she slithered away, finding comfort under the shade of a big rock. In no time she passed out, content to let her meal digest for the next few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny awoke the next morning, her stomach signficantly smaller than the day before. It had lost its human shapes, becoming smaller and more round. Giving it a push, she could feel the digestive slop inside shift. After hours of pleasurable sex, both you and Becky had finally been broken down, reduced to a homogenous digestive slop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her body, the naga was distressed to find herself thicker than when she had gone to sleep. Her breasts were a fair bit larger, plumper and more perky. As we her stomach, a little flabbier than she had enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well,\" Destiny thought, giving her human tummy a pinch. \"Guess that's what I get for eating two at once\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, you and Becky are never heard from again. Your fates unlearned, no one could have possible guessed that their dear friends had been reduced to fat on a beautiful naga's belly and breasts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have died.</span></div></div>",

Getting on your knees at the edge of the pond, you cup your hands and dip them in, pulling them back out and sipping the water from them. Refreshing!

The sphinx notices this and pounces on him. To your horror and fascination, you and Sarah see the sphinx begin to swallow Ben whole. In just a few short gulps, the sphinx completely swallowed Ben, and her belly extended out and began to wiggle with Ben's panicky struggles. Despite your fear, you come back to your senses, but Sarah was still horrofied. You run over to her to try and snap her out of it. However, you didn't notice that Sphinx was already aware of this. When Sarah got her senses, she saw the sphinx charging. She warns you and you both start to run. However, the sphinx was still able to keep up despite carrying Ben's weight. Unfortunately, your foot got caught in a root and the sphinx caught you under her powerful paws. As she held you down, you could feel Ben wiggling in the sphinx's bloated belly. She then says \"Not so brave, now are you?\", but you manage to tell Sarah to run. She picks up your head in her powerful month, and slowly began to swallow you into her throat. You could feel the powerful muscles pull you toward her stomach, and all you could smell was hot, smelly air. Outside, Sarah could see the sphinx slowly gulp down your waist, and the bulge in her neck as she gulped. The sphinx made quick work your legs as the only thing left of you outside her is your feet. Soon enough, you felt yourself enter completely into her stomach, and feel Ben as you enter. Ben ask \"So she got you too\" and you respond \"Yep, but Sarah, is still out there, maybe she will get away\". Outside, Sarah was running as fast as she could while the sphinx adjusted herself to her now double sized belly, but it take her long to notice Sarah. Inside, you and Ben could feel the sudden swaying and jerk of the belly. You both realize that the sphinx was on the move. You both are rocked back and forth inside the belly as the sphinx chased Sarah. Suddenly, you feel a sudden stop. You both suddenly hear muffled screaming on the outside. Suddenly, you feel the sphinx sit up right, and you heard gulping sounds. You both then realize a horrible truth, and on que, Sarah entered the stomach. \"I am sorry, guys\" she weeped \"I wasn't fast enough\", but you and Ben were understanding. She then asks \"How long do you think, it will be until we are digested?\" and you respond \"I don't know, but let us make it last\". You and Sarah starting kissing while Ben asked for them to get a room. Back on the outside, the sphinx could feel all the movements going on inside her huge, wiggling belly and was proud of her meal as she has not eaten a meal like this in a long time. She said \"It is going to to take me forever, to digest them, but it was worth it\". She then strolled all the way back to her cave with her belly swaying back and forth and decided to rest and go to sleep while she digests her meal.</span></div></div>",

Just then the sphinx's stomach bulges and moves frantically, Sarah is still alive! Maybe if you can beat the sphinx quickly you can get her out alive, as gruesome as that thought is..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Sarah will not be getting out. Alive, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphinx charges you, grinning madly. You wind up your club, slugger style<br>\r\n(BATTER UP)<br>\r\nand swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgilely, she jumps backwards, barely dodging your swing and then charges forward again, lightning fast. <br>\r\nBefore you can move to defend yourself she is leaping and knocking you to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the ground with her on top of you, knocking the wind out of you. As you gasp for breath her belly wriggles frantically on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphinx looks down into your frightened face, that grin still on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had to do it the hard way, didn't you? Oh well, I don't mind. It's not every day I get a huge meal like this anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin widens even further, until you feel sure her face will practically split in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to join your girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth opens wide, and for a moment as you stare into that deadly, wet cavern you wonder how many others have had that to be their last sight. Then all coherent thought leaves you as your head enters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle madly in denial of your place on the food chain but it does you no good. <br>\r\nShe swallows hard, taking you as easily as the struggling native woman. Her mouth and throat squeeze tightly around your head, and then your head enters the tight confines of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly and efficiently the rest of your body follows suit, being drawn deeper into the sphinx's digestive tract, helpless in it's slimy, yet deadly embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you feel damp, hot breath and smooth, slimy flesh around your ankles and feet. Then, they too are squeezed down and you begin your descent into her stomach. Your head pops through her cardiac sphincter and you are forcibly shoved into the horribly tight confines and pressed against something slimy, warm and very much alive. Sarah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaedon?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's pitch black but you can feel her body pressed awkwardly against you. Her voice comes from directly in front of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah? .. it's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no..\" Sarah wails. \"She got you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The native woman?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She.. She's underneath me. It's too tight and I can't get her out from under me. She hasn't moved or anything since I got in .. here. I think she's unconscious, or..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what to say and the silence draws out. You try to shift into a position marginally more comfortable but Sarah's right; moving is next to impossible in the black, hot gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence is then broken by a loud, long belch, followed by a sexy feminine chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god ..\" Sarah says. \"We're .. we're not going to get out of here are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe we will, but not for a while and not from the same way we came in.</i>  You think. Horrified by the gruesome thought, you push it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to answer that Sarah but .. no, I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect her to sob then, but she doesn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry..\" You say. \"After she got you, I saw you were still alive, and I wanted to try and save you but she .. I couldn't. She overpowered me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" She says. \"You're sweet, and brave. Anyone else would've just ran.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you don't know how to respond. You open your mouth to do so anyway, unsure of what's going to come out, but before you can speak your open mouth is met with hers. The two of you share a kiss that is brief but far from sisterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never told you this before.\" Sarah says. \"But I think I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk.\" She coos. \"I don't think we have long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kisses you again, and again, and in that time you wish you could have light. To see her beautiful green eyes one last time, but unfortunately it does not happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, the sphinx's stomach dutifully break all three of you down, but you barely notice as you slip into unconsciousness.. too preoccupied with the lovely Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a long time since the sphinx had had a meal as large as this, and she cherishes every moment. The feeling of her belly being so full of food it was near to burst might be uncomfortable to some, but she loved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe especially loved when meals were feisty, and this one had not disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a long time for her to digest such a large meal. So long in fact, that she almost began to believe she would never have to eat again all year. But, within a couple of days her belly began to shrink and soon, it was slim and sleek again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, her three morsels were broken down, absorbed and made to be part of her. Just like all the other meals before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several days, she felt the last of her three *mmm* \"guests\" reach the end of their tour of her digestive tract. And, not being one to disobey her bodies wishes, she released them, and left them to fertilize the jungle's lush foliage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, hunger began to squeeze her stomach again, and the sphinx decided she would need to eat again afterall. Smiling, she strolled into the forest, trying to decide where to hunt today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully, her meal would be nice and unwilling to cooperate, like the last..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The devil girl bowed and said \"Thank you! In case you were wondering, I'm the village matriarch, and i help by bearing the most children for the village. And now that I have you two cute humans to myself...\" she plays with her vaginal ring and resumed speaking. \"... There will be more for the next generation, and the village can prosper! you see...\" she sighed and frowned at what she was going to say. \"the larger predators of the island tend to eat anyone who gets lost in the jungle. Before I came to the village, there were only about seven people, and one child left. I offered to help, and within a few years, there were almost a hundred people in the village. Even outsiders can help with our population.\" she turned to the two of you and asked \"do you want to help me out, little ones?\" you and Becky nodded, but then you asked, \"how would we help you out? Miss...\" the girl introduced herself. \"Kuradel. My name is Kuradel. And there are two ways you could help me. One, you can help me make more babies, and be treated as village leaders...\" Becky was confused, so Kuradel told her how it could work out. \"With my magic, I can make you part boy, so we could make babies for the village, pretty little woman.\" Becky blushed, but you wanted to know the second option. \"And the second way?\" Kuradel blushed and (sort of) innocently said \"you become my babies, and can live forever if you do.\" you and Becky were confused. Becky had the guts to ask, \"How?\" Kuradel sighed, giggled, and began her erotic explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kuradel rarely told anyone of how her immortal unbirthing works (never to an outsider, until now), so she was a bit nervous. \"Well, you see...\" she lowers you two to her crotch and then opened her vaginal ring, before continuing. \"you climb inside me, and over a period of a few months, you slowly turn into my babies. And any baby of mine has eternal life. Should you be eaten, or die by any means, your soul will re-enter my tummy and you'll be reborn as a baby after a few months.\" you were convinced, and said \"take me in as your own, mother.\" Kuradel was excited and laughed before asking \"you're ready to get in momma's belly so soon? Very well then, in you go!\" you eagerly enter her body, and begin living out an unusual dream. some guys would kill you to take your place, so you close your eyes, and enjoy the rare and special opportunity you are taking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0upon beginning your climb, your smooth skin starts rubbing against her sensitive clitoris. As you climb, Kuradel moaned and gasped in pleasure. In an attempt to increase her ecstasy, she pinned Becky to her right breast (the nipple in Becky's face) and motioned Becky to feed on her milk. Seeing it as futile to resist, Becky began suckling on Kuradel, eventually grabbing onto the mound. Kuradel's milk was sweet and rich, and was so arousing, it caused Becky to release her naughty side. She began to prod the nipple with her tongue, occasionally (and skillfully) slipping her tongue into the fleshy spout, blasting the devil girl with pleasure. Kuradel was about to explode in ecstasy, and before she knew it, she began to finger her anus, and her body went absolutely psychotic. The cervical walls began to ripple around you, drawing your body slowly in. You felt a soothing warmth from Kuradel's body, and began to fall asleep. This would be the last time you would be awake for quite some time. Back outside, Kuradel begins gasping uncontrollably, her skin becoming bright pink, and her breath was steaming hot. She could still feel you slithering up her crotch, and increased her speed in her impromptu masturbation. You eventually reached the devil girl's os (the opening between cervix and uterus), and it happily began to swallow you up. You were too asleep to feel it, but Kuradel was moaning in an almost unbelievable sound and speed. For thirty-eight seconds, Kuradel's os would continue to devour you whole, until you were completely in her womb. Kuradel climaxed as soon as you were completely swallowed by her tummy, and fell backwards on the floor. Becky was full of Kuradel's milk, and began to fall asleep on the devil girl's breast. Kuradel's belly slowly rose, as you grew back to normal size. above the little village, the moon did the same over the trees. Tomorrow would be a new day for all of you, full of new lessons, reunions, and a new family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Becky woke up to a little girl stroking her back and hair. The girl was no more than three and a half years old, and her body was fairly petite compared to the other children Becky had seen. The little girl giggled and asked ,\"is mommy gonna have another baby, miss?\" Becky smiled and replied, \"she is. My friend Jaedon offered himself to her and now he's becoming a baby boy.\" the little girl squealed, as she finally gets to be a big sister, but asked the eventual question. \"Mommy's baby already has a name? I thought we were s'posed to wait 'til mommy lets the baby out of her tummy first?\" Becky smiled and was about to speak, but Kuradel woke up and told the little girl, \"mommy will tell you how it works when you're older, Emily. Now off you go! I have to speak with our little friend here.\" Emily smiled, went over to Kuradel and said \"Alright mommy, I hope Ben, Lee and Sarah can come out and play with me. *Mwah* *giggle*\" she kissed Kuradel's cheek and ran off. Becky was surprised and asked \"those were my friends' names! Did you put Emily in your belly like you just did with Jaedon?\" Kuradel laughed and said, \"that was the boy's name? Okay, please remind me when he's born, would you, dear? And no, little one, I didn't unbirth her. At least, not yet. The four of them offered to play with the children, so I happily approved. but recently, Emily ate some fruit from an Eterni-tree at the village outskirts and turned into a little girl. I treat her as my own, until the time comes to make her my real child.\" Becky nodded at her words, and began rubbing Kuradel's pregnant belly. </span></div></div>",

HOWEVER, we ran into this pig. Thankfully, we finally caught him red-handed! We found this monster raping little Alice, AGAIN! Now, I do want to rip his heart out and eat it for his cruel and blackhearted crimes, but Lee and I both think that you should be the one to punish him!\" Ben and Lee began to laugh evilly, but Kuradel was quite mad. Thankfully, Kuradel was able to relax, as she saw the children watching her. Kuradel took a breath, and said, \"I'm glad you brought the little monster to me, rather than scaring the children with frightening violence like that. Let me take care of this one, go play now!\" The two guys nodded and headed for the mass of clapping and cheering kids. Becky was a little curious as to what Kuradel was gonna do to the guy. \"so how are you gonna punish him?\" a smile came onto her face, as she said \"well, my babies need to have some fruits and veggies in their little bellies, so they grow big and strong like their mother! But sadly, the fields where they grow are in dire need of fertilizer. He's going to help me fix that!\" Becky jumped to a conclusion (by all her basic human understanding), and asked \"your gonna make him work by spreading fertilizer on the fields?\" Kuradel laughed in a low tone and gave a surprising answer. \"oh heavens, no. I wouldn't let a defiler of my children desecrate their land by making him work on it. He's not going to SPREAD the fertilizer; he's BECOMING the fertilizer. That is, after I turn him into my  poop, of course! Besides, my new little baby needs to have some meat too!\" The cannibal was flailing his bound body in complete panic, and after Kuradel said this, Becky was feeling quite strange. Normally, the mere thought of cannibalism made Becky extremely sick to her stomach, but this was anything but ordinary. Therefore, she was okay with her punishing the pedophile this way. In addition to that, to Becky, the thought of Kuradel swallowing a man alive and feeling him struggle in her belly as she digested him sounded so... erotic. Becky's imagination took hold, and after a minute of this kinky fetish being realized, she came to her senses (kind of), and made her move on the hungry and pregnant Kuradel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Becky smiled and said, \"sounds nice, but please let me massage your stomach after you eat him?\" Kuradel blushed and smiled. \"okay, little one, but before I do, let's make you my size.\" Becky nodded and walked up to Kuradel's lips, giving her a huge kiss. Becky was turned on by her move, and began to strip down to the full bare skin. Kuradel smiled and said, \"have some fresh honey, baby; it'll make you nice and big like me!\" Becky knew what she meant by honey (having had some time alone with a couple lesbians in her life), and headed for Kuradel's crotch. At first, Becky was nervous about doing this, but her fears quickly dissipated, for you were nice, snug and secure in Kuradel's womb. Becky pushed the labia apart and quickly began to feed on the wet cavern. Kuradel's honey tasted quite sweet to Becky, and she quickly got into the cervix, and closed the labia behind her. As Becky lapped up the honey, Kuradel shrank the captive cannibal to about three inches tall (perfect swallowing size for Kuradel), licking her lips as he shrank. Then Kuradel picked up the cannibal and opened her mouth to eat him. However, before she could taste him, she heard a loud belch from her crotch (it told her that Becky was stuffed). Kuradel giggled and pulled the stuffed young woman out of her vagina. As soon as Becky came out, she rapidly grew to Kuradel's size. Both were quickly aroused after looking at each other's nude form. Becky smiled and asked \"may I, baby?\" Kuradel nodded and put the cannibal in Becky's mouth. \"mmmmmmmmmm,\" came out of Becky (as to her, the cannibal tasted wonderful, and Kuradel said \"you can swallow him if you want, or give him to me.\" Becky thought hard about this and decided...</span></div></div>",

You stop hitting her stomach, another couple of burps like that and you'll be out of air, although it may be more humane than being dissolved you think. In an untimely coincidence a loud gurgle emminates around you, you hear the fairy girl moan loudly and start to rub her stomach even more, as if she can tell that her digestion has started, the walls start to excrete an acid, whilst it's too dark to actually see it, you do feel it. Your feet begin to tingle and then the stomach rumbles loud enough to knock you off them and the tingling runs over your entire body, you know that this is only going to get worse from now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! Please, no!\" You yell, squirming to get back to your feet but the chamber that is the girl's stomach is too busy churning you around and you lose all sense of direction, it not being helped any that right now, you couldn't feel your limbs, they had already gone completly numb from the acids, they worked fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was in panic, over the sound of the noisy stomach you could hear the girl giggling. \"Ooh I love it when they struggle, that's it, keep covering yourself in my fluids, you'll digest so much easier, mmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew there was some truth to what she was saying, the tingling was all over now and starting to get painful, you scratched your arm and the first layer of skin cells flaked off, that really worried you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help! Somebody! I beg you! Let me out!\" You yell, beginning to cry as she responded with a soft moan to your pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's only one way out from where you are little one, now hurry up and digest, I am hungry.\" She says staring down at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes after she says that you are still laying down inside of her stomach, digesting properly now, you had managed to spread the acid over yourself pretty evenly and now it had started to seep into your skin, deeply into some places, the pain was unbearable, you writhed around in agony. Unable to get up the digestive juices slowly built up till you were floating around in a small pool in the girls belly, screaming in constant pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a lovely meal.\" She comments, smiling and patting her belly one last time, you then feel her move, lying down, obviously to go to sleep. \"I'll see you tommorow little one, digest well.\" She smiles contently and closes her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath comes soon after, by the time it does you had been alive long enough to feel all your skin melt away as well as deeper in some places, it was almost a relief in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fairy slept her body faithfully broke down yours, melting it into a nutritious soup she would absorb and give her the energy to hunt more and more delicious humans like yourself.

But the truth is that we're just hungry. now I'm nice and full. the man in my belly tried to poke my neck with a little toothpick (to her, it's a toothpick, but at your size, it's a spear)!, so i cast a little spell in defense, and soon he'll be a part of my body.\" You gasped and felt pity for the fairy. \"I'm sorry about what he did Miss...\" the fairy introduced herself. \"Serenia, my name is Serenia.\" You smiled at her beautiful name. \"Miss Serenia, i had no idea that people would do this to you. i know I wouldn't!\" Serenia gasped and asked \"even when i told you i was going to to eat you? how do i know you aren't the partner of my snack?\" You answered with a question of your own. \"Do i look like a man who would kill someone else? i have no weapons, no armor, nothing for that kind of thing!\" Serenia understood you were truly harmless, and you finished up. \"Also, Serenia? to be honest, I think your really cute!\" Serenia hugs you in her bosom and says \"You are the sweetest human I've ever met! Thank you!\" you felt her heartbeat on your entire body, and it felt quite soothing to you. Serenia then asked the big question. \"What's your name, cute little man?\" Smiling, you tell her. \"Jaedon!\" Giggling, Serenia says \"Jaedon, would you like to play with me?\" you nodded and she sat down. \"Good, cause this is a game i've always wanted to play with a sweet man like you! the game is called 'Honey Spelunker!' wanna know the rules?\" you nod, and you start to get excited. as you have a good feeling for what it's about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Serenia began to explain her game to you. \"The game is simple, enter the cave, and gobble up as much honey as you can!\" You ask the obvious question \"What cave are we talking about?\" giggling innocently (to an extent), Serenia puts you on the ground, put her feet together (her legs trapping you in a diamond-shape) and with her fingers, spreads apart her labia, saying \"This one, of course!, as you feed, your actions will make me feel so good! now, there are some rules before you go in. rule number 1: you can't come out until you are full, or time is up. you have two hours to have as much honey as possible. as a side note, that's how long it'll take my tummy to digest. Rule number 2: you can go anywhere in the cave for honey, and there's even a point where you can get a lot of it. find the spot and release the honey, and you instantly win one of the grand prizes; me as your lover!\" you ask \"Serenia, is that a good prize? no offense.\" giggling, she says \"none taken, cutie! And oh yes; men on the island would kill each other to have a fairy as a bride! Now back to where i left off. rule number three, and i made this one up: because you are such a sweet man, you will win no matter what, but that doesn't mean to do nothing inside the cave. okay! to sum the rules up, have fun, fill your belly with honey, and make me feel good. when you come out, you will get a big prize or two!\" you smiled at Serenia's words, and say \"Okay! I'm ready!\" Serenia giggled and said \"then in you go!\" and you dove into the opening in Serenia's crotch, rubbing against her sensitive clitoris as you entered her body. \"mmmmmmmmmm! i'm so glad i found you, Jaedon.\" after thirty seconds, you are inside of her body. Serenia lets go of her labia, and her crotch swallows you whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0inside of Serenia's body, you are in complete darkness. you don't need to see to find Serenia's honey, as it's all around you. It even drips on you. it tingles a little (as her honey is slightly acidic), but it arouses you quite a bit. Your stomach starts to growl, so you begin feeding. You dig some of the honey off the walls, and try it. It's really sweet and filling to you, so you begin your sexual smorgasbord, and dig the honey, quickly swallowing it, until you mainly feel the cervix. You lick the fleshy walls for the honey you miss, and when it's gone, you move deeper into Serenia's crotch. every motion you make is felt by Serenia, and causes excruciating pleasure to her. She is releasing sounds that are between gasps and moans, as your wriggling in her body blasts her mind with arousal. You would keep doing this until you reached her uterus. Then, you tapped the opening, and it shuttered. Serenia yelped, and that was when you knew you found the spot. You start tickling, rubbing and patting the flap, causing Serenia to scream in pleasure. To be prepared, you put your mouth over the hole in the flap, to quickly gobble up Serenia's sweet honey when it flows out. Within a few seconds of putting your mouth in the opening, you start riding your tongue along the ring, and Serenia's gasps and screams get louder. She starts to fondle her bosom to add to her pleasuring. Not a minute into Serenia's sexual session, she let out a shriek (the kind you'd only hear in the scariest horror film ever) as her body erupted like a sexual Mount Tambora into your mouth. honey blasts into you like a flash flood. you feel you may drown inside your fairy friend's crotch, but her honey just flows into your stomach (no need to swallow, either!). within a couple minutes, your stomach is full to bursting, and you turn your head away from the spout. pressure builds up behind you until Serenia releases one of the most explosive climaxes you could ever comprehend. The pressure keeps rising until you are shot out of Serenia's crotch like a bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 as you are ejected from Serenia's sex, she playfully shouts \"And we have a Winner!\" you fly into Serenia's feet, and\u00a0they catch you, stopping you like a cushion (which was a surprise, as all of the island's people you've seen were barefooted). there was also a sweet smell from her feet, and you didn't want to get out. Serenia smiled and asked \"Jaedon? do you really like my feet that much?\"she could feel you nod, and mischievously said \"well you better come out of there, or you don't win anything! besides, i still have to 'total the score!' *giggle*\" you got out from between Serenia's feet and said \"ready for the final tally!\" Serenia giggled again and said. \"alright then! let's get you out of those icky, rags. after your score is in, you won't need them for a long time! I'm sure you would like that!\" you nod in agreement, and strip down completely. Serenia licks her lips and says \"I bet you're gonna taste real good!\" you were disheartened, and when she picked you up, she rolled her tongue out. You expected her to eat you, but soon after, she spreads your legs apart and puts you on her tongue. It feels like a slimy saddle to you, but other than that, it feels kind of good. Serenia giggles and rolls the tip of her tongue to hold your back straight, and brings you to her lips. Your member is erect, and when you get to her mouth, she closes her lips around the shaft. She starts to suck your shaft and run her tongue along the vein and glans, you start to moan uncontrollably, as her tongue feels so dexterous and warm to you. within minutes, you release a torrent into Serenia's mouth. She quickly swallows and picks you up. \"that was so tasty! It's a shame I can't love you and eat you too, I don't know the enchantment!\" you were down, but asked \"Is that going to be an issue, my love?\" Serenia laughed and said \"Oh no, it won't be a problem... yet! But when I learn the secret, you'll live forever with me! We will make so much love, and when I don't catch anything and I'm hungry, you can enter my belly in the night, and wake up at my side the next morning! When I learn the secret, we'll be happy together FOREVER!\" You smiled at the thoughts she gave you and said \"sounds lovely, Serenia, but i can't really do all that much with you at this size.\" Gasping, your fairy friend said \"that's right! Well, there is a way that I DO know that'll make you big like me!\" you ask the obvious question. \"how do we do it?\" Serenia giggles and...</span></div></div>",

She was preparing a spell for you. After her focus reached a peak, she smiled and pointed her finger at you, releasing a bolt of light from the tip. As it hits you, the world feels strange and sparkles start dancing around your vision. You begin to feel lightheaded, as your body expands rapidly. Before even a minute, you are Serenia's size, and see how beautiful she is from eye level. She is also looking at you, seeing every feature exposed on your body, and she starts to lose herself. \"Jaedon, you're gorgeous!\" You blush and reply \"well you look like a goddess, Serenia!\" She starts to float off the ground after your compliment (literally), and then, she darts for you. Serenia tackles you and begins cuddling with you. She whispers something into your ears, but you could not make out what she said. \"What was that, love?\" She giggles and says \"I wanna give you my flowers right now, Jaedon! Please? Take me away to paradise!\" You were surprised by her sudden plea for sex, but who were you to deny a woman? \"Anything you want, my love.\" She squeezes tighter and your glans starts to press on her tummy. Serenia giggles and grabs the bulb with her fingertips, and pushes your piece to her vaginal ring. She smiles at her behavior, and says \"after this, you can also take me from the behind, babe!\" You were stunned by her behavior, and your reaction discomforts your lover, causing her to ask \"don't you want me, baby?\" You shake yourself out of a trance and say \"any way you want it, darling\" she smiles and says \"Then let's do it!\" You comply, and slowly enter her body. Serenia moans at your movement and says \"Ah! Jaedon! So big!\" You smile at this before pressing up against her hymen. You slowly build pressure on the seal until it breaks, then move your hips at ramming speed. Serenia gasps and moans at your thrusts, eventually wrapping her legs around your waist and grasping onto your shoulders with her hands. You then stand up and take her away. Thirty minutes after taking the fairy's first flower, Serenia erupts violently (instead of Tambora, it was a sexual Krakatoa instead).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For twelve minutes, the two of you lay on the ground, staring at the sky. Serenia then looks at you and sees a smile of satisfaction on your face. She giggles and asks \"have you ever wanted to break down a girl's back door, Jaedon?\" You knew what she meant and cannot deny it. There was this very pretty and big-bottomed woman that worked alongside you back home. She was also one who haunted your deepest fantasies so long, you could not help but think of her behind and what it would feel like to take it. \"I did, Serenia, my love. But this was before meeting you, and her backside was huge. But I doubt I would have had the chance with her.\" Serenia giggles and \"innocently\" says \"I understand darling. Besides, you have me! And I DO have a pretty cute tush, right baby?\" She sticks her butt in your face, and you smell a sweet aroma (when normally it would be a horrendous stench. Fairies here always make sure that every part of their body smells sweet (inside and out) and looks appealing to both men and women of their prey as well as others of their species.). while you stare at Serenia's flawlessly smooth and curvaceous rump, your fantasies are taken over by the cute fairy you love right now. You nod and say \"it's nothing short of beautiful!\" Serenia giggles and replies \"then let me have it in there, baby! I wanna be yours forever!\" You smile at how to-the-point Serenia is, if not a little bluntly headstrong with what she wants; your love. Seeing the relentless desire in Serenia's words, you feel a strange lust for Serenia, and are happy to oblige in her wishes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You start teasing the sphincter with your fingers, occasionally slipping one into the fairy's rear. Serenia gasps loudly and blushes crimson as you wriggle your finger in her rectum. \"Too much excitement, babe?\" Serenia is panting heavily and replies \"Really soon, I want you to take your gift and lemme have it! I bet it'll feel REAL good then!\" You smirk at her eagerness, and pull your finger out of Serenia's anus. You are very surprised as there is no waste on your index, and it smells, strangely, like both cherries and strawberries! Serenia expected you were doing this, and says \"We fairies digest everything of whatever we eat, darling! the only time i'd let something come out of my belly is if i had a good reason to let it! *giggle* the best reason that i would have now is if you wanted me to!\" you smile at her words, and kiss her rump. she gasps, and says \"I want it now! Let me have it, my love!\" You smirk at her passion and reply \"Okay, you asked for it!\" Her eyes lit up quick, and the naughty fairy got on her knees, her butt still extended towards you. You tap Serenia's anus and it shutters. Slowly but surely, the sphincter opens until a nickel-sized hole is before you. You know the routine, and press your glans into the hole. \"Ah! Yes! Here it comes!\" Serenia blushed at her words, when you decide to take it nice, slow and easy with the fairy. Your motions are at a creeping pace, and this caused Serenia to feel like she's being ripped to shreds by ecstasy. She starts to fondle herself, and the excruciating pleasure continues for twenty minutes. At the mark, your phallus turned into a geyser, releasing an unimaginable amount of sperm into Serenia's rear. You collapse after your release, and Serenia looks at your exhausted body. \"Oh yes! Wonderful! I love you, Jaedon! So much!\" She bent down and gave you a big kiss, when suddenly her stomach growled loudly. \"Oh! We had so much fun I forgot about my poor tummy! Sleep tight, my love! I'll come back after I'm nice and full!\" A hungry Serenia flies off into the forest, leaving your sleeping body on the floor of her house. And when she came back, you were awake, and saw her stomach thrashing all around. But, who was in her belly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You had to ask her \" did you catch something, my love?\" She slaps her tummy a couple times and says \"You have turned my luck around, my darling! I caught six tasty humans while you were asleep! Five of them were, strangely dressed like, or almost like you were when we met!\" You gasped and asked \"could I see who they are? They might have been my friends!\" Serenia was a little upset. \"But... I spent all this time finding food so you could play with my belly tonight!\" Seeing her desire for a full tummy, you play your trump card. \"I'll let you do whatever you want to me if you let them out.\" Serenia thought about your offer, when you play the Godfather's charm. \"If they're rude or hurtful after you let them out, I'll let you eat them again too!\" Serenia smiled and replied \"alright, darling! Hold tight!\" She speaks a spell and her hand starts to turn almost ghostlike. She then reaches into her stomach and grabs its six occupants. Pulling them out, you swiftly recognize five of them, they are your friends, but the sixth one was from the Far East; China or Japan. She looked very scared seeing you as she was shaking like a leaf and whimpering quite audibly. Becky looked at you and asked \"Why the hell are you naked?\" You blush and try to tell what happened to your friends. Becky was a little skeptical about your tale but soon gave in and accepted your story with the other four. The last one was still scared of you. You put your hand out to her and she screamed. Serenia put the girl in your hands and you try to comfort her. \"I'm not gonna hurt you! Why are you so scared, miss?\" She mustered enough courage to speak, but her story is a sad one \"Everyone hates me! Last time I was with a man, he... cut... me! It hurts! So much! PLEASE! I JUST WANT IT ALL TO END! I BEGGED HER TO EAT ME, SO I WOULDN'T SUFFER ANYMORE! I WANT TO DIE! PLEASE, JUST KILL ME! I IMPLORE YOU!!!!\" She wept a raging river, when you began to pity her, and so did Serenia. You bring the girl to your lips, and kiss her head gently. \"I think you need a friend. We'll be your friends, Right babe?\" Serenia smiled and said \"Yep!\" Returning your attention to the girl, you ask \"What's your name, little one?\" She gasped and stuttered her answer. \"Na... Narue! Why?\" You smile and say \"Narue, welcome to the family!\" Serenia cast her spell again and Narue grew to your height. Seeing how kind you were to her, Narue wrapped her arms around you and started to cry in happiness. \"Thank you...\" Was all that came out of her lips before she collapsed in your arms, exhausted. Serenia set your friends down on the table as she helped you get Narue into the bed. Being ever so gentle with her fragile body, You tell Serenia that the young girl needs all the love she can get from the two if you. Serenia nods and wraps Narue in a blanket, so she can sleep soundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0the two of you head back to your friends. Serenia asked the inevitable question \"so what next, sugar? What'll we do with your friends?\" You wait and see how they treat you and her. How do they act?</span></div></div>",

Now apologize to this beautiful young woman, or suffer the dire consequences!\" Ben, Emily, and Sarah quickly apologized and were grown to your size.

As the two of them comforted the timid girl, she said \"I remember! He did it! He gave me these scars!

I know you hate me, and you have the right to have Serenia eat me! But please! Let me show you where she is!\" Narue gasped and asked \"Is... She... She's alive?\" Lee nodded and said \"Please, let me show you! Don't let me suffer without righting the error of my ways!\" Becky was fuming \"TRAITOR! WE WERE GOING TO KILL HER, NOT SAVE HER AFTER THEY MOCKED US!\" You were at the absolute limit, seeing the remorseless sadism in Becky's heart. \"Serenia, dispose of this evil bitch!\" Serenia licked her lips and said \"With pleasure, my darling!\"she picked Becky up and hovered Becky over her gaping mouth. \"You can't do this to me!\" Serenia spoke back to her prey \"Can... And am! This is for hurting my friends!\" Serenia released her grip and dropped Becky into her mouth. She savored Becky's flavor for three minutes, while you, Ben, Sarah, Emily and Narue hugged her. Serenia hugged you tight and you smiled, only saying \"incoming morsel!\" Serenia giggled and swallowed Becky whole. She screamed the entire way down. With a plop, a gurgle and a rumble, Becky's fate was sealed in flesh and acid. Serenia licked her lips again, and rubbed her belly, satisfied. \"Yummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0you smile at how cute Serenia was, and you catch Narue saying \"Alright then, Mr. Lee. I'll make a deal with you. If she's okay and alive, I'll forgive you and let you live. BUT! If there's even one hair hurt on her, you're joining your girlfriend in Seri's tummy!\" Lee nodded in fear before saying \"Miku's in a village full of children. There's a mother demon that watches over them. I think her name's Kuradel, but I'm not sure!\" Serenia smiled and replied \"leave it to me! I know where she is!\" You nod and say \"Good luck, my love!\" And with that, Serenia flew off towards the village of children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Narue then turned to you and said \"Jaedon, is it?\" You nod and she continued. \"You gave me a second chance at life. You made me feel loved! Thank you so much!\" Smiling, you place your hand on Narue's head and said \"no one deserves to be left behind. You needed a friend, so I was happy to oblige!\" You wink at her, and Narue then hugs you tight. She the tells you the whole reason for the new name mentioned; Miku. \"Miku and I are friends and orphans. We found each other on this island after our boat sank. We had to fight together just to survive. When that woman hurt us, she told Mr. Lee to get rid of Miku; my best friend.\" Lee then asked \"may I cut in?\" Narue smiled and said \"Sure!\" Lee bowed and said \"She was young, I couldn't kill a child-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you could cut two children and beat them up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears welled up in Lee's eyes, and he continued. \"I couldn't run away. She made me do it! She was always so sweet back home! But when we got here, I knew something horrid happened to her. She turned into a ruthless savage when we crashed here! I was afraid of her!\" He started to cry (sad to see a grown man do so), where Narue patted his head with her finger. Lee wiped his tears and said \"Miku told me of a mother demon, sweet as an angel, who could help. I tried to get her there, but I passed out before I could get to Kuradel's hut. When I woke up, I was in your gorgeous, new girlfriend's belly. And as I looked around, I heard Becky say 'this is all your fault, you stupid bastard! I should have killed you and Miku myself!' She was a monster after that day!\" Narue hugged Lee close to her heart and said \"it's okay.\" Suddenly, you heard footsteps from the front of the hut, And saw Serenia with a blue haired girl with two long pigtails. \"You're alive! Miku-chan! You're okay!\" Miku and Narue ran for each other, and hugged when they collided. Lee breathed a sigh of relief, and you told Serenia \"Lee is forgiven!\" Serenia smiled and replied \"And Mama K gave me a little trick! i wanna try it out on that evil woman, just to be sure it works!\" Narue and Miku were puzzled, When you heard her citing a different kind of spell, you figured it was the \"trick\" that she mentioned. one hand turned almost fiery, and then you heard her say her ghost hand spell. as Serenia reached into her belly, Becky bit hard into her thumb. however, this wouldn't deter Serenia, as she pulled out a feral woman, possessed by a savage dibbuk (spirit who takes it's host over like a parasite). Serenia brought her to eye level, and Becky started to whimper. Serenia was showing her angry side for the first time, and said (bite me again, and i will crush you like a littel, tiny bug!\" Becky shivered, and Serenia brought her flaming hand to her the one holding Becky. Serenia's fingers pinched her, and she slowly pulled, ripping the evil out of her. once the two were separated, Serenia placed the weary Becky on the table, where you covered her in a cloth. Serenia then gulped the essence down, and felt a strange and soothing feeling in both her mouth and her stomach. placing a hand on her belly, she said \"Who knew something so bad could taste so good?\" she turned to you and your friends, saying \"Ready for your turns?\"You had to ask your lover \"What did you just do?\" Giggling, Serenia answered \"I ate up the bad stuff in her spirit! the only hitch is, now i gotta do it weekly, as it will come back to live in her. the same thing can happen to you too, if you're not careful!\" Lee was the first volunteer, and his hatred filled Serenia up nicely. same would happen to the other five of your friends, as they were turned into sweet young people like Narue was, before her scare. Serenia patted her belly and released a burp, before asking \"Darling, may I eat you, now?\" You stepped forward and said, \"Bon appetit, my beloved!\" giggling, Serenia grabbed a hold and pulled on your arm. she put her hands to her mouth, and the scorn inside you was swallowed quickly. her stomach had a decent bulge from her feast, and said \"Delicious! now then...\" she pointed her finger at Becky and, once again, she grew. as she reached your size, Serenia smiled and said \"That's better! now it's almost time for bed, everyone! we're gonna pay Mama K a visit tomorrow, the kids'll be so happy to see you all! and if you're wondering, she prefers if other adults and outsiders to call her Mama K, now\" You nod and the eight of you get ready to go to sleep. Serenia grabbed you and said \"You're with me tonight, darling!\" Miku was with Narue, Ben with Sarah, Lee with Becky, and Emily was by herself tonight (By her choice) as your eyes shut, the night would bring much delight to you all, as, thanks to your mercy, you and your friends have just started your lives anew. Tomorrow is when you would truly start over, though...</span></div></div>",

NO DADDY! PLEASE STOP! DON'T DO IT AGAIN! I'LL BE A GOOD GIRL! I PROMISE!\" Narue was clearly traumatized by what her stepfather did to her (you feel it was rape, so you felt the need to crush something into dust), and was crying heavily. After hearing what she had gone through, you were heartbroken. You felt guilty after hearing their emotions change in a heartbeat, as well as from your own reaction and Narue's trauma. Serenia was about to speak, when you cut her off, and said \"Come give daddy a hug, girls!\" Miku squealed and hugged you tight, while you tried to comfort Narue. \"It's okay, I'm here for you, my child.\" Narue wiped a tear and asked \"Really? You're not going to let anyone do what my new daddy did to me?\" the thought of what her stepfather did was appalling, so you tell her \"if a man did that, i'd make sure he was punished direly. like... A long timeout in Mommy's belly!\" Serenia burped a little, and cutely giggled. this caused Narue to giggle and say \"Thanks daddy! *mwah*\" she kissed your cheek and the two of them went to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly a little girl (no more than four) came up to you and Serenia, asking \"will you come to see mommy today, Auntie S?\" Serenia giggled and replied \"why wouldn't I, Alice?\" Alice cheered and suddenly, Emily came out. \"What's your name, little girl?\" Alice giggled and said \"Mommy named me Alicia Adamethyst the Third. But you can call me Alice!\" Emily blushed and asked \"would it be okay if I called you Alley?\" Alice nodded and giggled. She suddenly asked \"Auntie S? Will you bring your friends, Narue and Miku over to play?\" You, Narue, Miku, Serenia and Emily nodded happily. \"Oh goodie!\" Alice started jumping excitedly before saying \"Okay then! I'll go tell mommy you're coming!\" She gives Serenia a smooch before heading home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0you and Emily got dressed (enough to cover your naughty bits) before Serenia told you \"darling? I told Mama K about how good you loved me, and she wants to make a baby or two with you!\" You gasp at hearing this, but regain your resolve. Emily proclaimed \"I wanna play with the children!\" Serenia approved, and the five of you head for the village of children (with Serenia leading the way). As you enter the gates, you see at least thirty boys and girls (all less than five) and the smallest girl said \"Auntie S brought friends to play with us!\" The children surrounded Serenia, Miku, Narue and Emily, while Alice led you to Mama K's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Meanwhile, back at Serenia's house...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ben woke up to a loud crash outside. He went to go check out the noise. What he saw was amazing, as he saw at five humanoid creatures, all of them were gorgeous.. One had a buxom body and a snake tail for legs (a naga), and she opened her arms as if to give him a huge hug. The second had the features of a BBW and had a spider's legs and abdomen for her legs (a dridder), and she blew a kiss to Ben. Another looked human, but had cat ears and a tail that was waving excitedly (a Neko). she purred at Ben and beckoned him to come closer with an adorable pose. Ben couldn't help but comply, as he was utterly hypnotized by the Neko. The fourth was calling out to Ben with the most beautiful voice he had ever heard (a siren of legend). her body was dripping with water, but when Lee got to her, she embraced him with dry skin, and whispered. \"You and your friends can have us whenever you want, as we want you all!\" before pressing her bare chest on his abdomen and giving his heart a kiss. The last one looked like she was entirely goo (slime girl, surprise) and surrounded Lee up to his neck with her body, before releasing an acidic aphrodisiac around him. Ben was moaning loudly, as he felt his most unusual fantasies had come true at the same time. Lee, Becky and Sarah came out and asked \"What are you doing Lee? Oh my word!\" The five of them giggled at your friends, and slowly moved towards them. Ben, Emily and Sarah tried to get back inside, but the other four humanoids were too fast for them, and they were caught and subdued. Sarah and Emily tried to scream, but the Neko and siren quickly kissed their mouths passionately, and the two young women were almost instantly calm. Ben was taken by surprise as the naga and dridder pressed their bosoms around his head, heating him up to the point of burning. After the three of them were satisfied, the five newcomers introduced themselves. The naga started them off \"it is an honor to meet you all. My name is Destiny, and there is so much that we want to show you in our love.\" The dridder was next \"Name's Deirdre, sugar. And you're so cute I just wanna eat you up!\" Ben was nervous, but then Deirdre continued \"relax, sugar. Nagas and dridders store the loved ones they eat in a special stomach to feed on their cream and/or honey. After our bellies are full of your love; we let you out and have some REAL fun with you!\" Ben was rapidly feeling excited and Deirdre could feel it. \"Mmmmmm, anxious are we? Whatcha think we should do, Destiny?\" Destiny giggled and said \"let's BOTH give him what he wants!\" Deirdre nodded and said \"with ecstasy!\" Ben moaned upon hearing this, and the two ladies carried him inside to give him the strange dream-come-true treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Neko released her kiss from Sarah and said \"I like you, miss! People call me Kitty, but I prefer to be called by my real name; Suzume.\" Suzume rubbed her head on Sarah's chest before giving her breasts a lick and a kiss. \"Meow! You taste so sweet! I just wanna gobble you up! If I ate you, I'd just feed on your spirit's sweet juices before I regurgitate your cute body. And since I love you and your friends, you'll be fine. If you weren't? well, I'd just eat your life energy till I was full.\" Sarah was frightened, but Suzume reassured her \"You have a lot of love in your spirit, so that'll be all I need, babe!\" She tickled Sarah's tummy before hugging her face to face. She wasn't scared of going in the neko's belly now, so they began their fun in the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Becky was under a sexual attack by the siren, as she was powerless to resist the tune she was humming. The siren worked her tongue all across Becky's body to get a feel for her taste. Once she had her fun, the siren spoke. \"You taste absolutely lovely! Once the sweet fairy matriarch of the island learns the ancient secret, I'll be able to eat you an much as I want!\" Becky was confused and mortified at the same time. The siren explained \"the matriarch of the island is a blue-haired fairy who goes by the name Serenia. She has SUCH a playful personality, not to mention her libido is astonishing. You see... she's tried to learn the secret of immortality for one she selects as her husband. The five of us saw her with a man, and she looked absolutely smitten. We feel that she has found her man, as it was written in stone.\" Becky was shocked \"That's impossible! I was his first love! We never knew of this place! How could he be 'the one' if we didn't know of this? There must be a mistake!\" The siren was disheartened, \"how can you say it's a mistake? Legend tells of two young girls, and six adults: three sons of Mi!xoMara, and three daughters of Cree'Arra (the island's equivalent of Adam and Eve), would be brought to the island by divine guidance, where the chosen son would become overlord of the island. The rest would be treated as kings and queens, for it would be his wish. In order for the matriarch's decision to be accepted, and the prophecy fulfilled, he must love the caretaker of the lost, forgotten and abandoned children. I believe she has rejected over five-hundred THOUSAND over her time on the island. Let me tell you her tale, and then I will introduce myself and my slimy friend. No offense\" The slime girl turned and said \"None taken, my dear! *giggle* this young man is really yummy!\"  Becky asked \"Does he feel good?\" She let a little burp out before saying \"my belly's never been happier!\" The siren then smirked and began the story...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the village of children...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the house and see a pinkish-red skinned woman breast feeding a baby girl. Knocking on the wall, Kuradel looks at you and smiled. \"May I help you?\" You muster the courage to ask \"Are you Mama K?\" She smiles again and says \"Ah! Another one! I hope you're a sweeter man than the countless others that came before you!\" You took a deep breath and came closer to the woman. \"Another one? For what?\" Kuradel laughs and answers \"to become king of the island! The women of the island brought another one for me to test. Pass and you'll be crowned, not to mention your friends will be treated quite well! Fail, and you'll be punished like all those before you!\" You compelled yourself to ask \"What happened to them?\" Smiling mischievously, she swallowed and traced the bulge with her fingers until it reached her stomach, where she licked her lips and rubbed her belly naughtily and satisfied. You were unnerved by her threat, but maintain your will. \"A brave one, I see! Good! Let's begin!\"</span></div></div>",

You try to fight your way out, but the stomach is like rubber, always snapping back no matter how you try to stretch the stomach. The woman says something to you in her native language, but you can't understand her. The heat quickly takes the fight out of you, and you soon fall asleep again, only this time you won't wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe native woman wakes to a rumbling intestine and a violent wave of gas. Stepping out of her hut, she squats behind a tree, taking a deep breath and relaxing her muscles. Your stinking remains fall to the forest floor, the shape of her turd shapped by her glorious anus. A second and third turd follow you to the ground. Some of your bones have survived the trip through her, though they are now rubbery and bleached. It's mostly your fingers, though one of your ribs made it through all right.

The maidens bathe you, comb your hair, and paint weird ritual symbols onto your body. Finally they place a necklase of animal teeth around your neck and lead you out to the front steps of the temple, where you are joined by Sarah and Valetta.  Sarah has been stripped of her clothes, bathed, her hair done into an elaborate braid, and similar symbols painted onto her body.  The villagers have gathered in front of the temple to witness the marriage of the sacrifices.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nValetta stands facing you and Sarah, and begins chanting in her native language.  You don't know what Valetta is saying, but her words are making your stomach and your cock feel strange.   A maiden walks up to you and puts a strange berry into your mouth, and then puts one into Sarah's mouth.  This berry had the affect of making you incredibly horny.  In fact all you can think about is banging Sarah.  By this time Valetta has completed her chant, and motions for you to kiss Sarah.  You and Sarah kiss feverishly, as if this were the last day of your lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValetta says something else in her own language, and her maidens come out of the temple laiden with trays of strange foods, bottles of wine, and jars of ointments.  They sit you and Sarah into elaborate chairs and proceed to feed you.  In fact the villagers all take turns stepping up and feeding you and Sarah some of the food or a cup of the wine.  You don't know how long this goes on, but after a while you start to feel full.  You glance over at Sarah, and not only is she looking like she can't eat another bite, her food stuffed belly is swollen and pregnant looking.  You think this strange because you know that you have eaten the same amount of food she has, yet your stomach is still perfectly flat.  Fortunately you note that the food trays and wine bottles are empty.  You are glad at this because you don't think you could eat another bite, and you are feeling very drunk from the wine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maidens then bring out an intricately carved bed, and help you and Sarah to lay down upon it.  They then proceed to rub you and Sarah with the ointments.  Though they are rubbing your whole bodies, on you they seem to be focusing on your stomach and your cock.  As they rub you down, you start to feel sleepy, and soon you are out cold.</span></div></div>",

From somewhere inside your throat you can hear Sarah moaning in ecstacy.  It seems Valetta was right when she said Sarah would enjoy being eaten.  Grabbing Sarah's butt, you swallow again, using her butt to pull her further into your mouth.  This has the effect of drawing her waist and hips into your mouth.  With her hips in your mouth, you reach your tongue between her legs to her pussy, and discover that she is already having an orgasm.  You decide not to linger on her pussy as your hunger is overwhelming now.  You slurp down Sarah's legs like spaghetti, and pat your stomach as Sarah curls up inside.  You burp loudly, and then get yourself comfortable in the bed.  You remember that you have the rest of the day to digest Sarah before you officially belong to Valetta.

Suddenly the villagers stop cheering and begin muttering amongst themselves.  Valetta looks down at her belly, but can see that it is shrinking.  She sacrificed Jaedon to the fertility goddess by eating him, but Jaedon had not left her pregnant.  If he had, her belly would've remained swollen, as the conceived baby would've grown to full term at the same rate he was digested.

Valetta's wrists are chained, and she is hoisted up in front of the fertility goddess statue's swollen belly.

They lead Ben and Emily off to the side, so they are not hurt by what is about to happen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seven maidens circle each other, each with a look of murderous rage on her face.  Then the clash begins.  The maidens pair off and begin fighting.  Fists fly, fingernails draw blood, and hair is pulled in a ten way cat fight.  Very quickly, one maiden vanishes into another maiden's stomach.  This maiden then grabs and swallows another maiden.  One by one, maidens are swallowed, until only two hugely swollen maidens are left standing.  They fight as best as their swollen bellies allow, and finally one maiden goes down the other's throat.  The last maiden stands triumphantly in the center of the floor, rubbing her hugely swollen belly.  One of the younger maidens brings a vial to the victor.  The victorious maiden takes the vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The goddess has chosen me,\" she cries, \"I, Kianna, am now her vessel.  The other contenders will be digested and sent to join the goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKianna gulps down the contents of the vial, causing her stomach to digest the seven girls within her belly in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Kianna says, \"my first duty as the goddess' new vessel is to send the previous vessel to join the goddess.  Let her be remembered for her faithful service to the goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKianna moves to stand beneath Valetta.  As Kianna opens her mouth, Valetta is lowered toward her.  Kianna feels Valetta's feet enter her mouth, and swallows hard.  Valetta's legs and waist vanish down Kianna's throat.  Kianna swallows again, taking in Valetta's breasts, shoulders, and head.  Before swallowing down Valetta's arms, Kianna waits as Valetta's wrists are unchained.  Kianna then slurps down Valetta's arms.  Kianna stands before the villagers rubbing her swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the celebration of the new vessel begin,\" Kianna said, \"I go now to digest the previous vessel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the villagers leave the temple, Kianna waddles back to the private chamber that once belonged to Valetta.  As the chamber's previous owner is being digested, the chamber now belongs to Kianna.  Kianna lies down on the pile of cushions and blankets and falls asleep to the gurgling of her stomach digesting Valetta.</span></div></div>",

She burps loudly, and then relaxes to digest her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaeden,\" Emily gasps, wriggling into a tight, intimate embrace with you, \"I thought those were your legs I saw going down this monster's throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you say, \"she also ate Becky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do,\" Emily says, \"we can't get out of this woman's stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Jaeden say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Emily says, a strange tone entering her voice, \"for some strange reason, I feel...\"</span></div></div>",

She then steps up to Emily, and kisses her passionately.  Emily eagerly kisses back.  She can feel just how horny Sarah is, and just when Sarah begins to moan into the kiss, Emily strikes.  She envelopes Sarah's head, and swallows hard.  Sarah slides into Emily's mouth and down her throat in one smooth motion.  Emily's belly surges outward as Sarah fills her stomach.  Feeling lethargic, Emily lays back down and sleeps while she digests Sarah.  By the time the sun sets, Emily has fully digested Sarah, and is now the equivalent of two months pregnant with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two down,\" you say, \"seven to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah has left me feeling hungry,\" Emily says, \"I think I'll go...\"</span></div></div>",

Emily makes her way toward the beach, and finds Ben sitting cross legged in the sand not far from the bushes and trees at the landward end of the beach.  With the stealthy silence of a cat, Emily creeps up behind Ben, and crouches for the strike.  Waiting for just the right moment, Emily pounces, cat-like, on Ben.  Instantly she takes his head in his mouth, using her momentum to drive him down her throat.  As Emily stands up from her pounce, she swallows, sending a Ben-shaped lump traveling down her throat, disappearing into her chest, only to appear a moment later as a bulge in her belly, where Ben is neatly curled up inside her stomach, ready to be digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d you say, \u201cthat was awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI call it the \u2018cat strike\u2019,\u201d Emily says, \u201cmy vore master taught me the technique.

You hope that after you find someone else she is still at the house so he can find her again. You walk within a few feet of the water and start walking along the ocean looking back and forth hoping to find someone else. You get your wish, sort of.<br>\r\n    A huge wave comes by and washes someone up infront of you. The person appears to be a 19 year old girl with extremely long blond hair, very pale skin tone, and oh yeah, a light blue tail. You're surprised, in part, because you had this phase when you were 17 and 18 where you often wondered what it would be like to find a mermaid. Whether she would have magic, or not, playful, skidish, or whether she would have cloths or not.<br>\r\n    The mermaid seems not to notice and crawls further up the beach to where to sand is dry. Once there the tail seems to fade and is replaced by legs. You're surprised when, not only does she have legs now, but she is also wearing a cute summer dress with flowers on it. She stands. You walk over to her, to introduce your self.<br>\r\n     You aim to say \"Hello, I'm Jaedon. Have you seen any of my friends\" and ignore the fact she's clearly not human. What you actually said, is \"Hello. You're a mermaid. I'm Jaedon. You're wearing a dress.\" Pause \"That kind of came out wrong.\"<br>\r\n      She extendes your hand which you take, a little too quickly, and shake. \"Hello Jaedon. I'm Ariel. Apparently you noticed me exit the water back there. I did not see you. And yes, I am wearing a dress. Very observant.\"<br>\r\n      After a few minutes you realize that you are still holding her hand. You retract it and put it in your pocket. \"Ok, Ariel. That's a nice dress. Have you seen any of my friends? Any humans?\"<br>\r\n      She thinks for a moment before saying \"Yes. While I was out swimming early I found a guy on a piece of wood floating there apparently unconcious. I dragged him in and put him just in the forest over there.\" She points, before continuing. \"Sandy blond hair.  Lots of freckles. Something gold fastened to his wrist.\" She all of a sudden looks worried. You're a cute guy Jaedon, so I feel I should warn you. You need to grab your friend and get off this island now. There is a lot of dangerous things on it. And beware of someone named Varna. She has somewhat dark complextion, green hair, and looks very muscular. She acts nice, but when she gets a group of people, she devores them all. She always eats the guys, especially the cute ones. As for the females, she sometimes devores them, but if they're pretty enough, she changes them somehow. I don't know if it's undoable, but no one else lives long enough to try.\"<br>\r\n      \"Becky!\" you exclaim, forgetting the fact that you are standing next to a mermaid. \"After I get Ben, judging by the description and gold watch, I have to get to her before Varna does.\"<br>\r\n      \"What's a watch?\" asks Ariel.<br>\r\n      \"Never mind.\" you say, moving towards where she had pointed. Sure enough, you find him there. He looks alright, but he's still unconscious. You drag him a bit closer to the water, then throw some what on him.<br>\r\n      Ben sits up straight and exclaims, \"What gives man?\" He looks around \"Where are we?\"<br>\r\n      You come over and say \"There was a shipwreck and we ended up on this island. I've only found Becky, but we need to get her. Ben, this is Ariel. She's a mer-, marine expert.\"<br>\r\n      \"Nice to meet you Ben.\" says Ariel extending her hand.<br>\r\n      Ben looks up at her and takes her hand. \"Well, met Ariel\" says Ben slowly kissing her hand. She laughs, a bubbly laugh. Ben stands up.<br>\r\n      \"Now you must leave.\" says Ariel. \"Before you get killed.\"<br>\r\n      \"We'd love to leave.\" you start \"But first we need Becky, the rest of our friends, and a way off of here.\"<br>\r\n      \"You shouldn't go back for any of them.\" says Ariel \"Their probably gone by now. You need to concentrate on getting off this island and saving yourselves.\"</span></div></div>",

No one is outside. You enter the house and Ben follows. Inside you find Becky sitting on a straw cot, running her tongue along her lips very slowly, apparently distracted.

Strangely, it doesn't hurt though, instead it fills you with bliss, almost sending you into an ecstacy induced coma. Your mind is so clouded with pleasure that you barely register the increased hotness spreading throughout your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it.\" you think to yourself as you lose yourself in the feeling, everything but the gentle kneading of the stomach walls escaping your mind, as if becoming one with Becky's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes, but you know nothing of it, only the continous bliss your body experiences inside Becky. Hours, days, weeks, who can say, it is all lost to a never ending feeling of pleasure and contentment that seeps into your very soul. Suddenly, as if being born again, you become aware again, the pleasure all but gone, except for the throbbing hotness you feel over every inch of your body. A cool breeze hits you, and you realize that you are no longer inside her stomach, and you wonder if perhaps it was all a dream. Slowly, you open your eyes, and find yourself looking up at an ancient stone ceiling, foliage growing over it wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've awaken, Jaedon.\" Comes a familiar female voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, his skin is really red, almost like a really bad sunburn all over, but worse.\" Says another female voice, again sounding familiar but as of yet unable to place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only natural, he just spent the last three days in my stomach.\" Comes a third, this one definately being Becky's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to tilt your head to observe your surroundings, and you find that you are laying in a puddle of vomit on a cold stone floor within an ancient temple. It appears you are in an elaborate throne room, with statues of full breasted women with overstuffed bellies lining the room, all made of the finest of ivory. Laying before the solid gold throne, which is shaped like a woman's head with the actual throne being her mouth and extended tongue, you see none other than your girlfriend, Sarah, upon it, with her beautiful oriental friend, Emily, just beside her. At your feet stands the smiling Becky, a trail of spittle still connecting you from her lips down to your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S.... Sarah?! Wha.... what's going on?\" you ask in confusion, barely able to put your words together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah is a vivacious red head, her skin being tanned brown just a bit, although not as much as Becky's. Her body isn't as shapely as Becky's either, who has wide hips, a beautiful, full ass, and a pair off Double D knockers that are just the right blend of firmness and softness without a hint of sag or stretch. Sarah is pretty womanly too, but everything is a bit less in comparison to Becky, with only D cup breasts and a hot bubble butt, and toned, sexy legs. You aren't complaining, though, the long flowing mane of red hair that comes to a stop just past her shoulders is slightly curled and ever so beautiful. It way not be as long or as soft as Emily's, whose black hair comes to a stop just above her butt and is softer than silk, but Sarah's hair is certainly soft and beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising from her golden throne, Sarah approaches you and kneels by your side. Taking your still damp face in her hands, she bends forward and kisses you passionately, her breath smelling sweeter than you recall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax sweety, everything will be made clear in time.\" she says lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans forward again, and you pucker thinking she is going to kiss you, but her mouth opens impossibly wide and you are soon being pushed head first into her stomach. You go down without a hitch, to relaxed to struggle at all, and from there, the experience is remarkably similar to before with Becky, Sarah letting out a massive belch that leaves you semi conscious, the walls forming to your body. It is only a few more moments before your mind is again filled with pleasure, this time from the woman you love. </span></div></div>",

To you, everything is waves of bile oozing down your skin as soft, velvety walls knead it into your flesh. Just how long you remain tucked away in your girlfriends belly remains unknown to you, that is until you again become aware of sensations all around you, much like it was the first time. No draft befalls you this time, and you seem to be on a soft fabric rather than a cold stone floor, but as you open your eyes you realize you have been expelled in the exact same spot you were in before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been awhile, my beloved Jaedon.\" Croons Sarah, almost dreamily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough this is the very same throne room as before, which feels like only moments ago while feeling like a lifetime ago at the same time, the room is very different. No longer does the temple remain in a state of disrepair, the walls clean and emmaculate as they were the day they were built, void of any overgrowth. The staues have been replaced with opal, ivory, and ebony statues of the girls, Emily, Sarah, and Becky. Below you is a lush, kingly red carpet with gold trim and incredible softness, and the whole place seems to have undergone vast repair. Slowly gazing up at Sarah, who is leaning down before you, you take notice that both Becky and Emily are on either side of the rebuilt throne, chairs in the shape of teeth beside the main tongue shaped throne, and are happily stroking their overly large tummies and smiling contentedly. Looking back into Sarah's eyes, you see a warmth and compassion in them you don't recall ever seeing, like she has found true happiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah? Wha...what's going on? What's happened to me.\" you say, confused beyond belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh... shhh..... calm down, my love. While you have slumbered in my stomach, time has past. Three and a quarter years, to be precise.\" she says softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th...three years? You mean I've b...been inside you for three years?!\" you shout in a panicy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Jaedon, there is nothing to fear, we're gods now. Well, goddesses, actually, but as long as you are in my tummy nothing can hurt you, and you will live in happiness forever.\" she says, stroking your cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha.... what happened to B..B...Ben and Lee?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See for yourself.\" she replies, turning towards Becky and Emily who still sit rubbing their buldged tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean they're...\" you begin, but are cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they are inside Becky and Emily. Don't worry, though, they already understand what is happening. The war is over, though. I wanted to spare you the horrors, because you are so dear to me, my love.\" she says, stroking down to your manhood and stroking it gently, it pulsing in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha..... wait. You're a.... a goddess now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you are my mate, sweet Jaedon.\" she says while nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to ask her another question, but are cut off as she leans forward and kisses you deeply, flooding your very being with a sense of contentment. When her lips open wider and begin engulfing your head, you aren't suprised, but don't bother fighting it. You don't know why, but for some reason, you feel that everything is as it should be. As you curl up in her stomach, the experience again mimicing your previous belly encounters, you just know that you will never wake from your pleasure coma again, and you are fine with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are sedated, Sarah returns to her throne and takes her seat, stroking her tummy lovingly. For eternity she rules the land as a goddess, forever absorbing nutrients from you and growing stronger, with you never needing substanance. Although you never experience another thought again, you live a blissful existance, an unending span of eternity filled with pleasures that, were you given a chance to have conscious thought, you would never want to awaken from. This truly is paradise!</span></div></div>",
