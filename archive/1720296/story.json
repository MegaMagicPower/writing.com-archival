As you entered the forest, you started remembering some of the stories and rumor that had been going around. They were all about a monster that lived in the forest. The monster supposedly didn't like humans and was strong enough to take down a bear with no hastle at all.  You knew it was just a story, but you were still freaked out by it.

You keep running, hoping whatever was following you would find something else to eat. Just then you see the bushes rustle ahead of you, and out jumps a really huge bear! You are now scared to death. You trip and fall right in front of it. It reared up, ready to attack. It swung a huge claw down at you, and you shut your eyes, awaiting the horrible pain. You can hear the bear fighting against something. You don't know what, but you're greatful that whatever it was saved you. Suddenly, you hear the bear run off, and you open your eyes. You see a creature that was about eight feet tall. It was red and had two long plumes of \"hair\" that were a white-ish color and went down to about it's waist. You've played the pokemon games enough to know that just with those two details, the being standing before you is a Blaziken. You then start to remember that now, those stories you heard are true. You were now sitting in front of the monster from the rumors. You assumed that the Blaziken would turn on you and destroy you, so you try to get up and run. The Blaziken turns to face you and you actually scream in fear. Blaziken looks at you with a bit of annoyance, but mostly sadness. You keep trying to get up and run, but you keep stumbling. Blaziken chuckles, and offers one of his claws to help you up. You back away from it, and run into a tree. Blaziken bends down to your level and... </span></div></div>",

He was now less than 2 feet from you, kneeling down, looking at you kinda worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou merely shiver in fear of what this creature might do to you, which seems to sadden the great beast. The Blaziken slowly reaches out to you, offering a clawed hand. Those claws were awfully sharp, but you managed to stay put. The expression on his face couldn't be lying... it truly looked sad, and almost dejected that you feared him so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shakily reached out, and took the clawed hand in yours, causing a small smile to appear on Blaziken's face.
