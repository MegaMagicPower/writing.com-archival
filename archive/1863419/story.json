She had seen these woods so many times, but as the Commander searched about for the silent young boy, he was nowhere to be found. She had controlled the Reapers, felt her thoughts flow through them as she bid them go about the galaxy to right their wrongdoings. Was she dead? Was this her hell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShepard?\u201d The hollow ringing of a voice called her name from the distance, but from where she couldn't determine. She passed between the trees, running her fingers over the bark. Somehow she was naked, and the cool air was more than a little uncomfortable on her bare, fair skin. Yet, if this was her hell, nudity was just one more punishment she\u2019d have to endure. The crunch of twigs beneath her bare feet broke the otherwise silence, though it was swiftly followed by another call. \u201cShepard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer green eyes gazed westward, following the more discernible voice. Who could be calling her name? It seemed so familiar. Still turning, the unarmored soldier froze in her steps. There he was, or what remained of him. The poor child who plagued her nightmares stared coldly at Shepard through lifeless, mechanical eyes. A husk. If her hell was not enough, her only company now was the husk of an innocent child. Another life lost because of her incompetence. He peered at her, tilting his head curiously, though he showed no sign of a threat. Shepard approached the poor, twisted child and placed a hand atop his head. It was rough and cold, almost chitinous in its rigidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d She knelt down, seeing him at eye level before pressing a tender, loving kiss to his warped cheek. With a twitch, the boy let out a howl, pushing her away. Shepard had most of her weight on one knee, and the unexpected shove landed her on her back. Sticks and leaves scratched her flanks and shoulder blades, but what followed was even more horrifying. Still howling, the husk child scrambled toward the defenseless woman, snatching her knees in both hands. Shepard\u2019s eyes widened, and though she tried to kick at the hollowed boy, she was powerless without her armor or equipment. Mechanical claws scraped her thighs, and the boy shambled between her legs, crawling headfirst for her bare loins. Panic gripped Shepard, and as the monster\u2019s cold, metal face pressed against her nethers, she let out a shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHEPARD!\u201d Her eyes snapped open, and the bright light left her all but blinded. Figures loomed over her, and she tried to flail, but found her arms and legs bound by straps.<br>\r\n \u201cCalm down, Commander.\u201d Chakwas? The familiar older woman\u2019s voice settled the young soldier a bit, and she blinked hard, trying to clear her vision. She was in a hospital room by the looks of it, and on the mantle sat a bouquet of beautiful, wildflowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What happened? Where\u2019s the boy?\u201d Shepard was surprised at the sound of her own voice. It was rough and weak. She couldn't raise her head, but she could feel that she was at the very least clothed. Chakwas walked around the bed, dismissing the unidentifiable attendants. With a nod, they each left the room silently. Chakwas slipped a small, electronic thermometer into the Commander\u2019s mouth, and after a few seconds it elicited a small beep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c97.9 is good. Your fever has come down, and it looks like your other vitals are stabilizing. Were you not so heavily composed of cybernetics, I\u2019d call this a miracle.\u201d Chakwas offered her matter-of-fact statement with a light sigh. A few lines formed along the doctor\u2019s brow as she spoke again. \u201cBoy? There is no boy, Shepard. It\u2019s likely you experienced some sort of fever-induced dream while you were unconscious.\u201d Chakwas\u2019 serious demeanor finally broke into warmth. \u201cYou had us all worried, Commander. Even I thought you may not come back from this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m full of surprises.\u201d Shepard\u2019s hoarse voice cracked into a dry laugh before her humor descended into light coughing. Chakwas tugged the hospital blanket up under Shepard\u2019s chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet some rest, Commander. You should be back to your old self in a few weeks, followed by some minor physical therapy for your leg. From the edges of her field of vision, Shepard could see her left leg elevated in a cast. \u201cIt really is remarkable what your enhancements can do for recovery.\u201d With her final observation, Chakwas strode out of the room, leaving Shepard alone. Exhaustion overwhelmed the bed-ridden soldier, and Shepard sleep take her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day was another surprise. No nightmares haunted her sleep, but upon awakening, Shepard found herself quite capable of sitting up. In fact, she felt worlds better. Had it really been only one night? Just for good measure, she flexed her left leg and found it completely without pain. Impossible. Not even her cybernetics could have healed her this quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Chakwas scanned her card to enter, but to her astonishment, the bed was empty. \u201cShepard?\u201d Chakwas reached toward the wall to press the security alarm, but a low grunt halted her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver here.\u201d As Chakwas rounded the tall hospital bed, she saw Shepard flat as a plank beside it, performing push-ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood heavens, what are you doing out of bed! You could cause severe damage to yourself, Commander. You must rest.\u201d Chakwas leaned forward to offer help, but Shepard leapt to her feet in a flash. \u201cMy word.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel good. I think I might be ready to get back on duty.\u201d Shepard clapped off her hands, though there was certainly no dust or dirt on the pristine military hospital floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will be the judge of that, no sit down on the bed and let me check your condition.\u201d Chakwas was clearly getting frustrated with Shepard\u2019s recklessness, but the brief examination left her speechless. \u201cImpossible. Your vitals are normal, and judging by the scan, your femur has completely mended. Overnight.\u201d Shepard responded with a silent shrug, but the good doctor shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you Shepard, before you awoke I was certain you would not survive. You suffered tremendous blood loss, and many of your major systems were moving into shutdown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you could say I\u2019m lucky.\u201d Shepard smirked and folded her arms across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky, my stars. I must run further tests. I cannot imagine how you\u2019ve made such a hasty recovery.\u201d Chakwas turned to her bench of equipment, and Shepard glanced at the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shepard sighed and leaned back against the bed. Chakwas continued rummaging through the equipment, and to the soldier\u2019s amusement, she saw a strong resemblance to Mordin in the doctor\u2019s intensity. Finally, the older woman turned around with a large, probe-like device in hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to enjoy this, Shepard, but I\u2019ll need you to turn around and remove your trousers.\u201d All right, this was almost identical to how one would expect Mordin to act, and at that, the Commander let out a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate your concern, doc, but I\u2019m not too fond of the idea of being probed for science.\u201d Shepard raised both hands and backed toward the large windows as Chakwas approached. The doctor continued forward mindlessly, holding out the device like some sort of perverse weapon. \u201cDoc? Are you even listening to me?\u201d Still the older woman advanced, though now her head twitched slightly, and as she entered in range, Shepard grabbed the outstretched arm. It was hard, metallic, unnatural. \u201cWho the hell are you, and what\u2019s going.\u201d The doctor\u2019s face spasmed and twitched before bright sparks began spewing from the middle of her back. In an instant the impostor doctor locked down like an old wind-up doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard walked around the frozen android and raced to the door, flinging it open. On the other side of the door stood a Cerberus soldier with his rifle aimed straight at Shepard\u2019s head. Diving back into the room, she took cover behind a metal cabinet. Yet to her amazement, he did not open fire. Now that she was back inside the room, the armored soldier lowered his rifle and shut the door, locking it from the outside. \u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShepard.\u201d This was the voice. This was whom she heard from within her nightmare. Deep, hollow, and terrifyingly ancient. A faint glow illuminated the front wall, casting Shepard\u2019s shadow across it. Turning about, the Commander saw her keeper. Her eyes went wide, and she could find no words to react. It was him. \u201cAre you afraid, Shepard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarbinger. The citadel sent out Shepard\u2019s consciousness into all of the Reapers long enough to reprogram them for good. It should have affected every last one of them, but here now floated the hologram of the primarch of the Reapers. \u201c...How.\u201d All she could do was wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am ancient beyond counting. Your diminutive mortal mind could never hope to sway one such as I. Your interference in altering the task of the others is merely a setback.\u201d He always liked to talk too much, but with each word, Shepard was regaining her composure. She\u2019d beaten him twice now, and she could find a way to beat him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd here I thought I was done hearing you preach, Reaper.\u201d Shepard placed her hands on her hips and glared at the orange glow. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep me here forever. The others--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c--will never find you.\u201d The deep, reverberating voice silenced Shepard, and she simply awaited an explanation. \u201cThe entirety of the galaxy has declared you a martyr, and they remain blind to your survival. Such is my will.\u201d Shit. If this was true, no one aboard the Normandy would be looking for her. Even still, she had no idea where the genocidal machine was holding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of me, Harbinger. Why else would you keep me hidden? Why haven\u2019t you just killed me yet?\u201d Shepard\u2019s resolve was growing, and she could feel it smothering the fear inside her. The machine clearly had a reason to keep her alive, but what was its plan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLocked deep within your mind resides the key to controlling the Reapers. I will reclaim this power.\u201d Harbinger\u2019s cold, faceless shell stared at her through the hologram. \u201cDue to the fragility of the human mind, alternative methods must be applied.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlternative? Tell me what you have planned, Harbinger.\u201d She stretched out her arms to the sides to solidify her helplessness. \u201cWhat harm can I cause from in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone. You are powerless, Shepard.\u201d The machine paused before regaling its scheme. \u201cYour physique has been enhanced with an abundance of cybernetics. Altering the process of indoctrination will allow me access to your physical properties with limited neurological tampering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you care to explain that to me so I understand?\u201d Although she was knowledgeable on several technological terms, Harbinger\u2019s meaning was still lost on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour pathetic understanding is beneath me.\u201d However, after a brief pause the Reaper translated the plan to layman\u2019s terms. \u201cYour body is mine to do with as I determine most appropriate.\u201d With that, the walls all shifted, removing the illusion of a hospital room. His words sent a shiver down her spine, but after observing her surroundings, she felt her heart sink. Shepard stood in the center of a large holding cell, that much was clear, but the walls, floor, and ceiling were metallic with blue lights scattered about their surfaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d Shepard looked about, but the false window was nowhere to be found. Instead, her only light came from the dim glow of the blue circles on each surface. If not for gravity, she couldn\u2019t tell you which way was down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInside.\u201d The one word response struck Shepard as odd, but she suddenly realized the severity of the word. She was inside Harbinger. If Saren could pilot Sovereign under the assumption it was a Geth vessel, existing inside a different Reaper was not out of the question. However, her thoughts were quickly broken by the sound of several ports opening up in the walls.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Without hesitation, she sprinted toward one of the circular openings, only to skid to a halt. Darkness lay beyond the openings, save for a pair of small, blue lights in each. A chittering hiss announced the Commander's new companions... husks. Once human themselves, the reaper corruption had fully transformed them into synthetic humanoid drones, bent by the will of the Reapers. The Reapers! That was it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first scrambled toward the unarmed soldier, Shepard held out her hands and shouted, \"Stop!\" To her astonishment, the husk obeyed, halting abruptly in its tracks. The others followed suit. Commander Shepard found herself surrounded by a quartet of silent, staring monsters. With no sudden movements, Shepard lowered her arms, watching. They stared back. It seemed her power over the Reapers extended to the foot-soldiers. \"Walk away,\" she ordered. Again they followed instruction, taking a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cling to hope, even when none remains. Your efforts are amusing, Shepard, but nothing more,\" Harbinger's rumbling voice filled the chamber, and the husks began their approach anew, now at a methodically slow pace. The soldier held out her hands again, sweat beaded at her brow. What little hope remained, sunk to the pit of her stomach. Not one of the husks showed signs of stopping. Yet Commander Shepard did not survive an improbably victory over the ancient destroyers only to be beaten by four measly husks. Scowling fiercely, the soldier battered a swift rising elbow into the nearest drone's jaw, knocking it from its feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such futility. I will enjoy breaking you, Shepard,\" Harbinger growled darkly. Shepard was a war hero, but even she could only stand alone and unarmed for so long. A hard kick to the second husk's chest sent it crashing to the floor. <br>\r\n\"No!\" Shepard shouted as the third wrapped its skeletal fingers around her wrists. She roared and flailed, but could not break free. Thrashing her legs about, the commander soon found one calf ensnared in the grip of the fourth. The first regained its composure and promptly seized her last free limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will hurt you, Shepard.\"</span></div></div>",

But if you fail, then the cycle will resume.\" Shepard thinks of this and asks, \"Why nine months?\" Harbinger says, \"That is when you will give birth to the next generation of Reapers.\" Shepard couldn't believe this and just asks, \"How many...?\"<br>\r\nHarbinger answers...</span></div></div>",

The Council would like a word with you on your findings.\"  \"I'll get that done right away.\"  Joker prepared the course for the Citadel, and they were on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Normandy docked into the Citadel, and Shepard headed to the Council.  When she got there, Anderson greeted her.  \"Shepard! Glad you could make it.\"  \"No problem.\"  The Council told the commander that they were disappointed that the beacon exploded, because it could have given them more information on the Reapers.  Shepard left the council angrily.  She started to make her way to the Normandy, but then her belly rumbled.  Shepard went to get something to eat. </span></div></div>",

Her eyes widened at the surplus of delicacies in front of her, spread out across several tables connected end to end. There was a wide assortment of food. However, everything else looked almost drool-worthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled again, so she grabbed herself a plate.<br>\r\nShepard went for the ribs next. As far as she could recall, she had never eaten ribs before. Now was as good a time to try as any. So sweet and so tangy, yet it still carried that lovely flavor of meat underneath the coating. Delightful. Shepard ate three whole hamburgers next, the meat grilled tender and the cheese melted to perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finally full, Shepard's flat abs had billowed outward into a rock-hard ball. Shepard touched it, and winced; the stretched skin seemed to tingle underneath her fingertips and stretch marks were all over her belly of the sudden expanse. She had eaten way more than she should have. Now that the euphoria was wearing off, the young woman was beginning to see it might not have been such a good idea to have indulged her inner-glutton. She released a magnificent belch that caught the attention of a few fellow crewmen. Shepard hastily apologized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Geez, I can't believe this...I'd never eaten this much before!' Shepard thought, groaning from both the stomach aches and from her own humiliation, 'I...I need to go and lay down...let my belly rest...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shepard belched again. She felt like she was going to explode, she was so full.<br>\r\n'Okay, that was a bad idea,' she thought, 'I really shouldn't have eaten that much! What was I thinking? But it was all so delicious...'<br>\r\nShepard rubbed her stomach again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n::::::<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her soft, fluffy potbelly bounced and jiggled in time with steps. If she sucked it in she could still see her feet, but her gut would scrunch up into several tiny rolls when she did so. A definite black line had formed that separated her stomach from her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something is wrong I should see the doctor.\" Said Shepard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was surrounded by multiple Cerberus scientists, who were told to speak to the Illusive Man. The head scientist spoke to him. \"What do you want to do with her, sir?\"  Illusive Man took a puff out of his cigarette.  \"Ms. Lawson has been a useful asset to us for many years, and with my idea, she will continue to do so.  Remember the Reaper-Human larvae on the Collector base, well, we were able to uncover multiple fetuses of the same type of hybrid.  I want you to inject these into Ms. Lawson.\"  The scientist spoke again.  \"Oh... okay.\"  After the injection, Illusive Man told the scientists to inject her with a drug that would make her forget the attack, and they obeyed.  They placed her back on Omega, and hours later she woke up, it was nighttime, and she couldn't remember why she was there.  She requested that the Normandy came to pick her up.

Curious, she touched one of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped, surprised at how sensitive they were.  \"What the hell?\" she asked out loud.  Not thinking any more of it, she took a shower.

Fuck them, she thought. Let them play around while the most important thing, the most important <i>person</i> was still missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fucking dumbass! You just had to...to\" She stopped, her breaths labored. She hadn't eaten anything in hours and the biotics, especially when in her rage driven overdrive, burned through calories like nothing. But that wasn't the real reason she stopped. Tears welled under her eyes, washing over her smeared makeup and dirt stained cheeks. She couldn't say the words<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You left me...You just had to go and...and die...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nin the distance, the hulk of a Reaper groaned while an Alliance crane crew hauled it off of a building's metal skeleton, nothing compared to the sounds it had made when it was alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been down here nonstop since the fighting ended. No victory party for her. She'd been the first one to start digging, always holding out for Shepard to walk over the ridge with a big dumb smile. Stupid of her, but she couldn't resist the thought. The alternative, was unthinkable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kicked a chunk of concrete. \"Some big damn hero you turned out to be, leaving a girl all alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't stay here forever. She was neglecting her students. They'd fought harder than could ever be asked of kids their age, seen terrible things, lost friends. And here, she was, ignoring them and digging through the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned away, started down the rubble path back towards the relief camps. Another groan from the dead Reaper got her attention. Something caught her eye, under the demolished titan was a body, covered in blood and dirt and the remains of a melted black bodysuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard coughed.</span></div></div>",

Do not want to be premature. She has experienced massive trauma, her suit was fully compromised, and as much of her body is cybernetic to the point where she needs a bio-engineer more than a doctor,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's turned away, lips hanging open. She come so close, finding her again after all that. To lose her now, on an operating table, would crush Jack in a way she couldn't imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" the doctor's tone shifted to something upbeat, almost prideful, \"Shepard is resilient, a true hero's resolve. Not want to heap on praise but Icon for us all really. Recovery probable.\" The salarian beamed, \"Now if you'll excuse me I have other patients to attend to, ones... less fortunate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn't blame him. Reaper victims were piled by the dozen into whatever medical service could be thrown together in the London ruins and the few functional hospital ships in orbit, to say nothing of the number of dead. Earth was a graveyard, they should start handing out shovels as standard gear to new arrivals. It was a massive relief off her shoulders to hear the doc's words, but at the end of the day there was only one patient, one woman, that she cared about and she was in there, broken and bleeding on a bent metal bed and it hurt to see her like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed a hand against the window glass, \"Please,\" a lonely tear rolled down her cheek, \"you promised you'd come back to me. Don't make a liar out of yourself now, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">*</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack barely moved from her chair in the dingy, hastily sterilized, former-office building that had become one of the most active ersatz hospitals in London. She'd take her meals right there by Shepard's room. To keep herself from drowning in the feeling of being a little lost puppy, she'd visited her students. They'd done her proud when the fire was on and it'd be wrong to let them see her as down as she was when they'd been through as much. She had to be their rock. So she put on her best face with them, cracked a joke or two even. Rodriguez had survived, sans an arm and it was a whole new ballgame for her just learning to live with the prosthetic. But every minute away from <i>her</i> left Jack feeling like something was breaking inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the word came through, \"She's awake. You can go inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack flung herself across the room and slapped Shepard across the cheek, instantly regretting it but doing her best not to show it. While Shepard gave her a perplexed, \"Gee, thanks,\" look, Jack swooped in for a kiss. It was sloppy and off-guard but Shepard played into it almost without missing a beat. It was her all right. Jack pulled back, trying to smile and regain her composure at the same time, \"Don't go dying on me, Girlscout.\" Shepard smirked, \"I'll try not to,\" and cringed, \"This still hurts as bad as it looks. I think I have more bandages and medi-gel in me than blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack could feel like herself again now that she'd talked to her, felt the warmth of her lips again. It was a miracle seeing a sign of life more substantial than the beep of a machine or the flow of fluid in a tube. She was real again, back and alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried not to visit everyday, the parade of friends, military officials, and press to see Shepard, the Hero of Earth, made it easier. She found time to eat again, put up her hair, bother with makeup. She helped Rodriguez and her other students. Half her job at this point was playing grief counselor to the kids. It was therapy for herself as much as them. Over the weeks the place began to look less like a crater and more like an actual city again. Jack's heart soared as Shepard progressed, she can stay awake for an hour became she can walk became a discharge--and aside from some irretrievable pieces of Reaper shrapnel, a full recovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't wait for nightfall, they didn't even make it out of the building. On the abandoned top floors, in the open air, they went at each other, very long awaited glad-you're-alive-sex. It was the most passionate moment of Jack's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">*</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard technically remained on active duty, the PR department would never let the most valuable Spectre, the Savior of the Galaxy, retire but she had her choice of posts and she wouldn't have anything but right where she belonged at Jack's side, mission: live happily. The Academy temporarily relocated to Argas III, a sleepy rural Alliance colony that had been mostly spared Reaper assault. It was idyllic really, approaching the point of supplanting the ruined Eden Prime as a natural-wonder pleasure planet. Greenery wasn't really Jack's idea of paradise but the students seemed to like it, the fresh air was good for them. Rodriguez had stayed on as staff, a sort of understudy/assistant. Some day that kid was gonna steal Jack's job, and she was damn proud of her, of all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all the pride in the world wouldn't cure the sick stomachs she's been getting lately. Maybe it was this placid colonial food messing with her? It was more than that, lots of little symptoms that seemed to say this wasn't some local space-flu. When she missed that time of the month, her alarm bells really went off. She went to a med-clinic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fucking with me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human doctor shook her head, \"'fraid not ma'am. Pretty cut and dry to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, lady, I'm a... I have a... girlfriend, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my business at all what you do, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gritted her teeth, her biotic aura flaring up in pulsing blue waves spiraling around her arms, \"I know what the fuck goes on down there! Know how long since I've been with a guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, calm down. We'll run some more tests but there's no two ways about this, you're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">*</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow is Jack Pregnant? </span></div></div>",

She could have just as easily vid-called and spoken to the metal body but for this, Jack somehow preferred talking to \"the computer\" directly. Seemed more private, EDI's artificial lips never had to move to send a signal across space. She knew that for anything wrong or weird in her life there was one thing she could always turn to and place blame on, Cerberus. Goddamn Illusive Man was haunting her from beyond the grave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she needed her medical records to have a chance at figuring this out, and a cyber-warfare platform built by Cerberus seemed to be the perfect tool for the job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A great deal of records were lost in the destruction of the central Cerberus facility. Fortunately, I took the time to mine the databanks and copy them into my memory. In some ways, I am the only surviving witness that many of these programs ever existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, skip with the moralizing, diagnose me already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not a qualified medical professional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack rolled her eyes, \"You're an AI.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have access to detailed analysis of all known medical subjects and processor capability far in excess of any organic mind, yes,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's not a qualification?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medical science is not my... hobby. I enjoy art and philosophy. I endeavor to improve my dancing and humor. Were Jeff to be critically injured, I would not prefer myself to administer care in place of a doctor no matter how capable or well versed in medical theory and practice I may technically be. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having said that, my inherent design architecture makes delving into record archives a very enjoyable task. Thank you for requesting my assistance. As you are aware, a multitude of projects were employed in concert to develop your biotic abilities. The asari possess great natural prowess in biotics and were thus attractive research targets for Cerberus in the Subject Zero project. Portions of heavily modified asari DNA has been spliced into your own. This combined with cell grafts has had a non-insignificant effect in biotic output.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what the hell does any of this have to do with a baby out of nowhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The asari biotic biology is inseparably tied into their reproductive systems. This seems to have adapted itself into you. The Cerberus scientists initially believed the inoculation to have resulted in sterility--a regrettable but acceptable side effect. However, a more perfect bond with the element zero nodules in your body infact amounted to manifesting a similar DNA self-randomization process for the purposes of reproduction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, your biology is now functionally similar to the asari process, a system that is gender-irrelevant. When you engaged in biotics during sexual activity with the Commander, you conceived, naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked down at her stomach, ran her hand over her flat belly. She was toppless, if EDI could see her, she didn't care. \"Wasn't the first time that I've used biotics in the bed by far. How didn't I notice this 'till now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The asari body defaults to negative reproduction, allowing for unwilling conception to be avoided but emotional intensity can override this contraceptive. I would suspect  your strong attachment to Shepard is the reason that you have been impregnated this time and not previously. To summarize, you are in love.\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe holo-avatar fizzled around her fist. \"I cannot feel that,\" EDI reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack smirked. She ran her hands over her minuscule breasts, inspecting them, tweaking a nipple; imagining how they would change, wondering what would happen to her tattoos as this went along. \"So, that's it then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is additional information. You will recall that the program did not approve final inclusion of any modification until it had undergone extensive testing and approval in other subjects before integration into you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, the other kids. Cerberus knew about this, did it on purpose? Just one more way they found to screw with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to work-logs, when the asari-reproductive modifications had been established and approved as a side effect of other eezo bonding attempts,extensive testing was performed to ensure maximum efficiency and fertility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one wasn't enough for them, huh? Had to push for a damn army.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. Omnisexual reproduction controlled through artificial insemination would be a significant benefit to this effort. As a result, while unresponsive to traditional human methods, you are extraordinarily fertile. Multiple fertilizations are highly likely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're telling me that if I keep sleeping with Shepard, because I, uh, like her, a lot, I'm gonna get pregnant a bunch, with a lot of kids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer image of one baby, maybe a daughter, sucking at a teat changed, would it be twins? Triplets? More? Practically a whole litter of them would be running around before long she imagined. It was hard enough trying to come to terms with just one kid on the way, this was almost too much--and supposedly it was going to keep happening. She was not sure at all how to feel.</span></div></div>",

Jack could see herself ballooning up, Shepard more than happy to dote on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought made her happier than she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack?\u201d She jumped up, snapping from her revere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck, you scared me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize.

You have previously visited a qualified physician, one you stated made the initial diagnosis. Would they not be acceptable again?\u201d Jack paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, you know as well as I do that nobody else would believe this. They\u2019d just think I\u2019m the psycho bitch who cheated on the universe\u2019s savior and got knocked up.\u201d Jack waited for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a rather\u2026unusual case.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, look. I need someone who I can trust. Someone who won\u2019t spread this around. That\u2019s you.\u201d There was another pause. Jack could feel her heart hammering in her chest. If EDI didn\u2019t agree, that meant going back to the clinic. It would only be a matter of time until someone recognized her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour distrust in those you do not know is rational. I accept.\u201d Jack sighed, collapsing back onto the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like a second opinion. As I stated previously, I would not trust myself in making a diagnosis. I would like a professional to double-check my conclusions.\u201d Jack bit her lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got someone in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will contact them immediately. Do not worry, I will be discreet. In the meantime, I will send the mobile platform to Argas III immediately.\u201d EDI added as Jack opened her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026thanks.\u201d  Jack said in a low voice as she pulled on her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Jack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~*~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Shepard, you home?\u201d Jack called as she opened the door. With no answer, she stuck her head into the kitchen, dining room, and living room. Sighing, she made her way upstairs and opened the door to the Com room to find her sitting in front of a communications relay. More often than not Shepard would spend the majority of her hours in front of it, being updated on the state of the galaxy. However, it usually wasn\u2019t too difficult to pry her away if she got creative.\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t ask if it wasn\u2019t important.\u201d The hologram of General Hackett stood before them. While not a physically imposing man, Hackett commanded not only the alliance forces, but the attention of all those who stood before him. There was only one other soldier who commanded that sort of respect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that general, but I don\u2019t understand why it has to be me.\u201d Shepard was hunched over, brow pinched in her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need this investigated in order to confirm the safety of the region. We have a squadron ready for your command. I understand your reservations, but the risk of danger would be minimal. It\u2019s doubtful you\u2019d even see any action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeneral, in another life I would have said yes in a heartbeat.\u201d Shepard met the general\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut I can\u2019t make that decision alone anymore. I have a family now, it\u2019s not my decision to make.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack\u2019s eyes glistened, her hand flew to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which, I believe we have some company.\u201d Jack flinched as she realized Hackett was referring to her. Remembering herself, she ran towards Shepard catapulting herself into her lap. Planting a sloppy kiss on her companion, she looked at the distorted figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrying to steal my girl, General?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHackett\u2019s voice dropped noticeably. \u201cHello Jack. Only for a month, max.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d Jack switched the console off before the general could get a word in. Flopping back, she gazed at the woman of her dreams. Shepard couldn\u2019t help but laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck him, what\u2019s he gonna do, discharge you?\u201d Shepard laughed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was the doctor, everything okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack swallowed, \u201cI\u2026yeah. Everything\u2019s fine. Some kinda bug.\u201d She lied, and knew Shepard would accept it. Why wouldn\u2019t she? It\u2019s not like she could get pregnant with another woman. Whoops. It could wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you gonna go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDepends,\u201d Shepard curled a stray lock of Jack\u2019s hair around her finger, \u201cdo you think I should?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck no.\u201d She looked away. \u201cBut I get that you might need a vacat-\u201c Jack shuddered as she felt Shepard\u2019s lips pressing against her neck. Another, this time an inch higher. Each kiss shook Jack until their lips met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re my vacation. I\u2019ll never need time away from you.\u201d Jack hooked her leg around Shepard\u2019s waist and pulled her elbow out from under her. An aura of blue surrounded her as she landed on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo. They can have you for a month. Tonight you\u2019re all mine.\u201d She whispered, dropping her shirt to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~*~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay? You\u2019ve been awfully quiet.\u201d Jack slightly trailed Shepard, almost pulling her along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I just don\u2019t feel like talking.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d The two strode in silence for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that new? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you wear a shirt that\u2019s covered your stomach before.\u201d Jack rubbed her stomach before quickly drawing her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019re giving me crap about my clothes? Why don\u2019t you just go already.\u201d She tried pulling away but found herself pulled back. Shepard grasped her other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. I\u2019ll only be gone a few weeks, okay? If you need me to come back, I can.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I know.\u201d Turning around, Jack stared deep into her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShepard, I need to tell you something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201c Jack felt her face grow warm. She broke Shepard\u2019s gaze and looked downward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Jack could feel it. The doubt. Not in Shepard; in her. She never thought she could love another person as much as she did Shepard. But bringing a child into the world, let alone more than one, was something she never considered. Telling Shepard would make it\u2026real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026love you.\u201d Fingers pushed her chin upward and lips met another pair. Her eyes popped in surprise, but slowly closed as she lost herself in the embrace. Shepard withdrew slightly, \u201cI love you too.\" The two embraced for what seemed like hours until a hapless flight coordinator made sure the commander knew the schedule. After Jack made the man cry, the two hugged again. She gave a half-hearted wave until her ship was out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down in bed, Jack's mind buzzed with thousands of possibilities. Eventually her eyes closed and she drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Collapsing, she allowed herself a rare respite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack took a few deep breaths before someone collapsed on the bench next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that was quite a workout, ma'am.\" Rodriguez gasped, sucking air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, you deserved it. Buncha pansies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am\" Rodriguez leaned in, \"if something's up, you can tell me.\" Jack rubbed her stomach. Her clearly rounded stomach. While no student had dared comment on it yet, it was only a matter of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Rodriguez, I could run circles around you. Dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saluted, \"Of course, ma'am. Stay well.\" Within a minute she was alone. Jack sighed. It had been less than two weeks since the diagnosis, but it was clear that Jack was pregnant. She had taken to wearing baggy clothing, but no one had mentioned it yet. Or no one had the guts. Her stomach had pushed out where she looked at least in the second trimester, even if she wasn't even halfway through her first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess EDI was right about the army thing.\" Jack thought in resignation. Standing up it was clear that her stomach wasn't the only thing that had grown. Her breasts had quadrupled in size since EDI had made her diagnosis. Luckily, Jack didn't have much to quadruple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard should be home in a few weeks, shouldn't be much to reveal then.\" Jack stood up and made the slow trek home. Collapsing on her couch, she didn't notice the increased comfort. Before she could press the console, the hologram lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey beautiful, miss me?\" Jack melted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly. How's the action?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Few and far between.

I'll check in with you soon, alright? Love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too.\" With that Shepard disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Jack. I received EDI's message, I should be arriving soon. We have much to talk about.\" Before Jack could lean forward to delete the message, a figure stepped out of the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, it's good to see you.\" EDI announced.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack stood on the clinical white observation deck, the sideline of the field-ops training center, hating every second of it. She had a vista view of the kids running through counterinsurgency maneuvers in small asymmetric fire-teams. Textbook shit mandated by the Alliance that she didn't give a fuck about, but begrudgingly knew went a ways towards keeping some heads from being blown off of their shoulders. It wasn't the job that bothered her. In truth Rodriguez was running this, she'd picked up the slack and stepped into Jack's shoes once she started calling in sick again and again, and doing a damn fine job of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ground her teeth. Everything tasted of vomit since that was what she'd spent most of her time doing. Despite that, her stomach begged for food. Biotics burn a lot of energy. Normally, one high-calorie nutrient bar filled her up. Not counting the ones she had spewed into the sink, Jack ate four of those already. She was active and naturally pretty wiry, she was going to have to pack away a lot to see this through. She was running out of things to eat around the house. Shepard was loaded but, away on a mission or not, she would notice the account draining away to order a thousand packets of hanar kelp gel that under any other circumstance Jack would fucking loathe but could not get enough all of a sudden. Her tits were getting too touchy-feely with the inside of her shirt, even if she wanted a bra it was not going to happen. The inevitable urge to piss pounded in her bladder. And the cherry on top of all this was her feet swelling just enough to make her shoes a real bitch to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was enough to make her want to punch a wall, which she had done, a bunch. Between that and the empty fridge, Shepard was going to notice something. The pressure of trying to tidy up before she came back was just one more thing on the list of shit Jack wanted to bomb with batarian sticky-fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, she could stand up straight today, mostly--the railing was helping--so here she was. One of the students, Emily, a real prodigy, was the last one standing in her squad, playing the defensive home team role on the \"destroy\" end of the Seek and Destroy mission they were running. A seeker team had her boxed in, two men covering the exits to the zone while the third went in to ferret out the enemy from the pre-fab dummy building the exercise called for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they found her, she struck first, a low mass tunnel towards the farthest target with a high-mass propulsion on her own lunge that sent her on top of the guy with him out cold before the other two even knew what was happening. She could've fled, the door was open, but she turned, dropped the mass from under the other doorman's feet, sending him hovering like a kid in a pool with floaties on his feet. The ferret had caught up and had her dead to rights with her stun-rifle, but Emily pulled out some really hot shit for this one: with a grunt and a heavy aura around her, she reversed the seeker's kinetic barrier, the girl was stuck in a net of her own tangled suit emitters. Not a shot in Emily's direction and all hostiles down in seconds. It was almost perfect. Too perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack jammed the red siren on her omni-tool app. \"What'd you do that for, everything was green,\" Rodriguez said. Jack ignored her, stomping down to where Emily was helping her last victim disentangle herself from her own safe-suit's systems. \"What the fuck was that! You going to try that when they aren't using stun-rifles? Flashy fuck-ups on a Cerberus assault trooper gets you dead!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wounded look ran across Emily's face, like she'd been punched in the gut. \"And you asshats,\" Jack spouted at the two conscious members of the seeker squad, \"That kind of advantage and look how sloppy you play it! You deserve to eat dirt.\" She engaged the loudpseaker on her omni-tool, \"The rest of you, go home. Class over. You fucked up. See if I give a shit when you come back, if ever,\" and stormed off to the darkest corner of the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan was to wait until security came to escort her out, because telling Shepard how she lost her job was one more thing she needed. They didn't come, instead Rodriguez arrived, just as the ruined locker door clanged to the ground. Jack took a seat on a bench and cradled her bloody knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, What happened out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it up to them, you hear me? That's an order,\" Jack said with tears welling in her eyes. \"Do damage control, keep them in their seats and .. I don't know, get them ice cream? Something good. And Emily, fast-track her to the next program tier. If the Alliance doesn't cherry-pick her and turn her into an N7 ninja, she's probably going to run the Academy one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all well and fine, Teach, but right now I think they're worried about you. I'm worried. What's gotten into you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Jack gave the welted locker door one last biotic-enhanced barefoot stomp. Her shoes were lodged in a wall somewhere. She looked Rodriguez right in the eye, \"I'm pregnant, okay. That's the big fucking deal.\" Letting that air out was like popping a lead balloon that'd been parked in her chest. The dam holding back her tears shattered and salty waterworks stung her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa. Congratulations, I guess.\" Rodriguez took a seat beside her on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big goddamn winner I am. So now you know why I've been out and why I'm going away for a while, if I still have a job anyway. No bullshit, you've been great at taking over for me. You're there for those kids, there for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've always been there for me, Ma'am... Jack.\" She smiled, the same dumb, buttery, best-and-worst reassurance smile that Shepard could pull out of her ass on a dime. It came with a rainbow, a unicorn, and the warmest kind of fuzziness Jack could feel on her heartstrings.She suddenly remembered she was topless. </span></div></div>",

It was her own fault; she chased after the retreating Cerberus not even considering it may have been an ambush. Stupid. The tunnel was too narrow, and she was at a dead end. There wasn\u2019t going to be a rescue party. She couldn\u2019t move an inch out of cover without a grazing shot to the temple. Jack knew it was only a matter of time until her biotics failed and she found herself back in the hands of the Illusive Man. She wouldn't allow it. She couldn't. Her hand shook as she reached for her sidearm. Before she could raise it, the shooting stopped. After a long minute, Jack allowed herself to peek around the corner. Her heart stopped. There, bathed in the dim lighting of the tunnel, stood Shepard. Flashing that stupid grin, she limped towards Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about next time we try something different and you save me for a change?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard had a few fractures, a lacerated something. A black eye. But she always lit up when Jack showed up. Even when Jack found the courage to apologize, Shepard waved her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d do the same for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she would. And that was when Jack knew. It had taken a while, but she had found someone that could put up with all her bullshit. Someone who loved her <b>and </b>could handle her. When she had found Shepard alive in the ruins of London, she never thought she would love anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what the hell was Rodriguez doing in their bed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm\" Rodriguez turned pulling the covers tighter. Jack hated how it melted her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack. Jack? JACK\" She shook herself, Shepard looking back at her, eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on? You seem like you're in another galaxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...nothing. Just been having trouble...sleeping recently.\" Looking down, hoping Shepard couldn't read her guilt. Rodriguez was lounging on the couch just out of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in a week and a half. They have me going on the last mission as a \"show of force\" or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're their deterrent? A girl scout like you couldn't back down a hanar.\" Jack looked up and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard ignored her, \u201cThink you can hold out that long?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith my eyes closed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too.\" Jack blushed, voice firm. Shepard clicked off with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Jack felt an arm drape around her neck and a gentle kiss on her cheek, \u201cYou okay?\u201d Everything came crashing back. Jack leapt to her feet, slapping the arm away. Her insides were boiling. It was the worst hangover she\u2019d ever had, a thousand times over. Her head felt like it was splitting in two, torn down the middle. And she had heartburn something awful. She stared at the floor, fists and teeth clenched, eyes welling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was Commander Shepard. She saved the whole fucking universe from extinction. And in a week and a half all I\u2019m going to be is the unemployed bitch who\u2019s magically pregnant with a fucking platoon who happens to be cheating on her with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019-Jack, I can go, I don\u2019t need to be he-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the worst fucking part\u201d Rodriguez turned to see a pair of tear-stained eyes looking back, \u201cI want you here more than anything.\u201d She took a step forward only to shield her eyes as the room was suddenly awash with blue. Lowering her hand, she found the couch hurtling towards the wall and Jack covering the suddenly unoccupied space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack-\u201c Her lips rudely interrupted Rodriguez\u2019s, but they allowed for the rebuttal. She backed the taller girl up, slamming her into the wall. Rodriguez opened her mouth to groan, but it was quickly filed with Jack. Her kisses were battering rams, hitting Rodriguez so hard her head recoiled off of the wall behind her. Her hands took a brief moment from manhandling Rodriguez to rip at her own clothes. Stretched tight against her growing body Jack let out a growl, tearing them from her body. The two bounced from wall to wall, groping and kissing in a whirlwind of emotions. Stumbling to the bed, the two collapsed, little sleep to be had for both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gasped, woken from a restless slumber. Her heart was racing, eyes darting to and fro until she realized where she was. Allowing herself to lean back, she wiped the cold sweat from her brow. Turning, she couldn't see her face, but the rising of her chest told Jack that Rodriguez was still there. Of course she was. Attempting to blink the sleep from her eyes and failing, she laid back down. That was when she felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor weeks, Jack had meticulously kept tabs on her body. Down to the last inch, if she was going to get fat from these brats, she was going to know about it. Her stomach was round. Hardly enough to be noticeable, her tattoos distorted the view substantially, but round all the same. Her breasts were another story. Any growth was going to be obvious, but now? She hefted one in her palm, noting how it almost filled it. Jack reached a hand out Rodriguez\u2019s shoulder, but stopped. At least someone was using the bed for its intended purpose. Tilting her head back, she stared at the ceiling, no longer fighting sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack felt like she hadn't done anything for a week but eat. Of course she had done other things, there always seemed to be a spare moment to reflect on how bad this fucked up situation made her feel. And she had to pee like a racehorse, finding herself on the toilet again and again. But when Rodriguez was working with the kids, she was stuffing her face more often than not. It wasn't all going to her fat ass, although that was getting bigger. The elcor in the room was her belly, which had gone from a rounded paunch to a small basketball, a firm undeniably <i>pregnant</i> mound that warped her tattoos. The changes didn't end there, her hips were flaring slightly outward which forced her walk into the beginnings of a waddle. Personally, the thing that had most of her attention, other than perhaps the stomach, were her tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe actually had boobs now, gaining cupsizes until she was larger than Shepard. She wasn't quite to the level of ultra-bimbo Miranda Lawson's perfect swimsuit model rack but if she kept up at the same rate she didn't expect it to be far off. It scared her the first time things got milky. They were feeling extra bloated and swollen, oddly \"full\" when she tried to massage them and drops of off-white milk trickled out of her nipples. She freaked out, one more thing to the \"this was really happening\" list but the fullness was quite real and irritating. She found relief in draining them into the sink where the trickle became weak faucets of warm fluid. When she saw Rodriguez again, Jack reluctantly asked her to pick up a milking machine at a colonial market, she would reimburse her of course but on top of generally not wanting to go out into public as she was, she didn't want such a purchase to appear on the account where Shepard could see it. Rodriguez had laughed a little at her story of draining into the sink and gotten onto her knees, biting her lip suggestively. \"I'll get it tomorrow, I promise... but tonight...are you sure you're empty?\" Jack liked biting and sucking and enjoyed receiving the same, but this was something else. She could get off on Rodriguez draining her tits as if the girl were between her legs, pleasure radiating from her big, sensitive breasts through her whole body. With some regret she relied on the milker the next day but steadily found herself needing it more often, the milk issue compounding as her bosom grew. Now she used it twice a day in concert with Rodriguez drinking her fill. She felt like a cow, a huge cow that needed biotics to get up and move properly-- biotics which drained energy and had her emptying the pantry again. She had gained thirty pounds and estimated she looked like she should be six months along even if she knew she couldn't be more than four at the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the sickness seemed to be over, instead of vomiting all she felt was the desire to eat and fuck mingled with the persistent guilt of being a backstabbing cheating cunt. She hadn't meant to do anything with Rodriguez. She was her student for fuck's sake, this was wrong on multiple levels. But she couldn't stop either. She would beat herself up all day long and then spread her legs-- naked as she stopped bothering with the pretense of clothing, nothing she had would fit her and she would have to strip anyway to feel her horny self up-- on the sofa near the door so the first thing Rodriguez would see coming in was her, wet with anticipation. And she would spend a passionate evening with her, almost wordless but for telling each other not to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodriguez had tried to break it off, right after that first time, giving all of the right reasons and apologizing but doing the right thing was never Jack's strong suite. She just reached up and kissed her, stronger than ever. And it had continued that way, Rodriguez not offering further resistance while Jack invited her in every night. There wasn't time for much else with Jack officially filing for medical leave and Rodriguez taking up the slack, working over time to keep Emily and the others on the track to being the Alliance's future biotic superstars by day and coming to the home Jack and Shepard shared--<i>it's in Her name, Jack, never forget that, she owns all of this</i>--and getting even sweatier. She wasn't built like a soldier, couldn't be quite as fit as the Girlscout but she took care of herself and Jack did not discount old space stories of latina feistiness. Her prosthetic was cold carbon, unfit for the bedroom but she was skilled enough between the one arm and her mouth to more thank make up for it. Jack used biotics to make up as for her continuously decreasing mobility and together they found a rhythm that surprised both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an unforgettable week, but all those moments, every sloppy, guilty kiss, every morning's awkward stumble from the bed before she was awake enough to use biotics followed by taking stock of her waistline and other changes, every night awake staring at the ceiling in a cold sweat paled against the moment the inevitable happened. The door was unlocked and in walked the wondergirl while Rodriguez was buried between Jack's legs. Her expression was burned into Jack's mind, as much as any of the horrors of her Cerberus childhood. She hadn't seen her so broken since London.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shepard lingered in the doorway for a few seconds, the three of them in a stunned silence. Shepard started to mouth a word before stopping short, creasing her brow and withdrawing out the door. Jack's heart pounded while she lived a nightmare before her eyes. <i>That was it. I'll never see her again</i> and from that emptiness a rage boiled to the surface, at everything, at the slut on the couch with her, who sat shrinking like a mouse that wished she was invisible, clutching reflexively at her stump of a shoulder. But mostly, Jack raged at herself, as she stomped across the house that felt so incredibly empty, wild unrestrained biotic fields levitating objects and furniture at random and shattering glass. Their back veranda, built of a beautiful and deceptively bullet resistant transparent paneling erupted into a hailstorm of shards. Beyond the chaos, a shape caught Jack's eye, an unmistakable figure which dropped her dead in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed the silhouette out into the yard towards the large, lone tree atop the nearest hill, not giving a damn who saw her wearing nothing but tattoos and shame. Her instinct was right, Shepard was at the border of their outdoor shooting range inspecting a pistol, some prototype alliance toy they had asked her to play around with shortly prior to her latest deployment. \"Hi, Jack,\" she said before sending a round downrange. Bulls-eye at fifty yards, she knew how to deliver under pressure. \"it's been a long week, hasn't it? Felt like a lifetime away.\" She fired again, another round tore through the target's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn't have the words to put to her emotions, she had to hope the apology on her face and tears stinging her eyes could somehow make it clear how she felt. \"It's alright,\" Shepard said without looking back at her, \"You don't have to say a word if you don't want to.\" Her shot split the last portion of the neck, severing the head, sending it tumbling into the dirt. \"But I do have questions, obviously. I would appreciate answers.\" Shepard tapped a control and the pistol collapsed in on itself. She stowed it in her belt before facing Jack, who could feel Shepard's iron eyes scanning her naked, bloated body. \"Does she make you happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack hesitated before the truth found its way out of her lips, \"Yes,\" she said with a broken voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. That's... good.\" Shepard glanced at the dirt and her eyes lingered there for a second, seeming to soften, the daggers digging into Jack's flesh dulled for an instant before her gaze came right back up, sharp as before. Jack had never felt so penetrating a glare in her life except for once, when she had first met the Illusive Man as a child. He had looked at her not as a human being, but a weapon, a thing, an asset and Jack could only wonder what Shepard saw her as now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... Rodriguez, isn't it? I've seen her a few times. If you had asked me yesterday, I would have said she came off as a nice girl. It's good you've found someone nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the gun was holstered, Jack knew Shepard was a quickdraw. She could go from her stance into a shooter's pose in the blink of an eye and have the gun ready and a round between her eyes before Jack could think about raising a kinetic barrier. Was that where this was heading? Was she going to kill her? Would Jack even resist? She felt so empty, so crushed that she doubted she would even if it were possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's forget about her for a second. I'm more interested in the man. Who is he? Is it even just one guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jack mustered the will to say, \"There's no-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the fastest draw she had ever seen Shepard pull off, a blur of motion punctuated by a bullet the size of a grain of sand ripping through the air a hair's breadth from Jack's temple, leaving her ear ringing. Instinct and reason both told Jack that she had to fight or flee for her life, her heart a sledgehammer in her breast. Emotion kept her stubbornly rooted in place. She wasn't as afraid of dying as the alternative, she was certain any other alternative would shut the Commander out of her life forever, this sheer terror beating out the primal fear of facing down a gun barrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't lie to me, Jack!\" Tears now wound their way down Shepard's cheeks. \"You expect me to believe that all that happened on its own,\" she gestured toward's Jack's jutting midsection. \"Or maybe... Rodriguez... I admit I didn't inspect her closely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack could feel her lips quivering, her mind racing to try to find the best possible explanation to offer, and then, before she knew it, again, she told the truth, \"They're yours. You are the goddamned father. It's you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard held her under the gun for several seconds, her aim becoming increasingly less steady before she safed the weapon again and dropped it to the dirt. A lead curtain of silence hung over them for what felt like an hour before Shepard asked, \"How?\" and Jack explained to the best of her understanding, going over the whole situation from when she first suspected something amiss up through the events of Shepard's missing week, taking every opportunity to give herself shit and try to make it clear how horrible she felt. When it was finished she said, \"So, now you know. Can you ever forgive me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive you, Jack? Forgive you? Jesus, I could have killed you! I don't know if I'll ever forgive myself, let alone be able to ask the same from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time Jack became aware of the night chill on her exposed body. She shivered involuntarily and wrapped her arms about herself. Shepard reflexively stepped forward and wrapped her own arms around Jack, offset to the side as her stomach made a direct approach impossible. Jack never felt more secure than she did now inside the firm grip of the soldier's muscular arms. They stared into one another's eyes, Jack finding the soft, comforting and sappy woman she loved wholly replaced the stone cold killer who had occupied the space earlier, tinged with regret perhaps that the two had ever crossed paths. Long seconds passed of their warmth mingling in the embraced before Shepard leaned in for a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Jack stopped her. \"Never leave me again, ever. Do you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never,\" she punctuated it with the meeting of their lips. It was slow, deep and drawn out with Jack steadying herself against her taller lover while Shepard sent one hand searching down Jack's bare back to caress her rear and kneaded at her expanded breast with the other. It was the most intimate moment of their lives. When an era had gone by and they were forced to separate for air, Jack's libido anticipated Shepard taking her right there in the dirt under the moonlight. She would not hesitate an instant once the Commander moved for her. She collapsed to her behind and spread her legs in invitation. Shepard gave her one of her trademark smiles and reached for her pants, but instead of undoing them, she pulled a surprise from her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wasn't at all what I had planned but I think it's as good a moment as I'll ever get.\" She flicked open the small black case to reveal a simple gold ring adorned with a single glittering diamond. She dropped to her knee and offered it forward, \"Marry me?\"</span></div></div>",

It had been 11 months since Commander Jasmine Shepard defeated the Collectors and saved the galaxy. Samara smiled inwardly. This peace meant no one was stupid enough to commit a crime, so she was able to finally rest a bit. Everything was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for one big problem. Samara was very pregnant. With twins. And two months overdue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Collectors were defeated, the Normandy crew swung by Illium to celebrate. Jasmine had to convinced Samara to indulge a little, but eventually she began to enjoy herself. 12 drinks later, Samara and Jasmine woke up in the same bed. They decided to not talk about this and went on with their lives. 3 days later, Samara was vomiting a lot and was lethargic, so she went to see the Doctor Chakwas. That's how she found out she was pregnant. Since the Justicar code forbade having children, Samara decided that they would be adopted. So she waited for nine months for the twins so she could put them up for adoption. Her due date came, but nothing happened. She waited another 8 days and still nothing. The Doctor examined her and discovered that her biotics were preventing birth. Since they couldn't get rid of Samara's biotics, they simply chose to wait it out. Now 11 months pregnant, Samara decided that she wasn't giving birth anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Samara heaved herself off the chair and onto her feet. She waddled over to the door to leave for the bathroom, stopping by the mirror to examine herself. She still had trouble believing this was her now. She was still wearing her usual outfit, but it was tight on her. Her breasts were almost the size of her head and quite heavy, ready to feed the children when born. Her hips and butt had also filled out, giving her a motherly shape. But they couldn't compare to the globe that was her belly. It was slightly bigger than a medicine ball and very heavy with the twins, but had no stretch marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intercom pulled her out of her thoughts. It was Miranda. She was due for her checkup. Slowly, she made her way over there, careful not to trip. When she entered she saw...</span></div></div>",

But right now, there's something I need to tell you and I wanted Shepard to be here. Could you please sit down?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara eased herself into a chair near the door, one hand holding her belly. When she was comfortable, Dr. Chakwas continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep it as short as I can. When I first realized that your biotics were preventing the birth of your twins, I thought that it was a temporary biotic overload brought on by your pregnancy and that it would pass. But I found something from your last check-up. When Asari are about to go into labor, their biotics become incredibly weak. Your biotics, however, are actually getting stronger and, based on the numbers I showed to Mordin, are going to continue growing stronger. We don't know why yet, but we know one thing, Samara. You are never going to give birth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silent for quite a while until Shepard finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you tell us this earlier?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I had to have Mordin check because I thought it was a error in the equipment.\" Chakwas told Shepard. Then she turned to Samara. \"I'm sorry Samara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara looked down at her belly for a moment before looking back at Chakwas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this\" Samara finally said.

Hopefully fans of the series and pregnancy will add to this. You don't have to be a fantastic writer, though I'd really appreciate keeping the additions at least a paragraph long (I'm sure there'll be exceptions at some point, but it's a nice goal eh?). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">Setting:</font></b> This is set after an alternate, non-canonical ending to Mass Effect 3 (for obvious reasons). All central (I.E. Normandy Crew during ME:3) characters survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the beginning you'll be able to choose if that character is pregnant at the beginning. If you choose that she isn't, you don't have to make her the one who gets knocked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you're just a casual fan, any info you need can be found in the extensive wiki: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_Wiki\" target=\"_blank\">http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_Wiki</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo scat, urine, etc. No male pregnancy. No death of major characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember to have fun with it, and remember that the focus should always be on pregnancy as far as fetishes go. No major weight gain, though a little bit is normal with every pregnancy. ;) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
