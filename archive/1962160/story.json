            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyoko Kirigiri was going to spend yet another night studying with her best friend, Makoto Naegi. Despite her stoic demeanor, Kyoko greatly enjoyed spending time with Makoto. While Kyoko found him to be rather hopelessly optimistic, she found it, along with many of his other traits, to make him incredibly endearing. Being such a huge dork somehow made Makoto absolutely adorable to Kyoko though she would never admit it to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kyoko entered Makoto's room, she saw that the brunette had a surprisingly large amount food with him. There was a large pizza along with plenty of hotdogs, hamburgers, soda, and potato chips. Kyoko had no idea Makoto was such a glutton. She couldn't imagine him eating this all by himself. He was certainly going to have a big belly by the time he was done eating, that's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto, is there a reason you plan on stuffing yourself silly?\" Kyoko asked as she sat down next to Makoto on his couch, a stoic yet puzzled expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just for me, Kyoko.\" Makoto clarified. \"It's for both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is far too much food for two people.\" Kyoko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I kinda went overboard, didn't I?\" Makoto said, a sheepish smile on his face as he scratched the back of his head. 'I guess I got so much because of how long we studied last night. We don't have to eat everything, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't eat everything.\" Kyoko said. \"Or even most of it for that matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid of a little stomachache, Kyoko?\" Makoto teased in an attempt to get his friend to break her stoic facade. \"Or are you afraid of getting fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko instantly blushed as she heard this. An image of herself obese appeared in her mind. She had a big jiggly belly that would jiggle and bounce with every step she took, large impressive boobs that rested on top of her big tummy, a huge bubblebutt that jiggled as much as her belly, flabby arms and legs, and a plump face with chubby cheeks and a double chin, which caused her to look much less intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat image alone horrified her enough. Kyoko then imagined what this fat version of herself would look like after stuffing herself with a massive meal. She way laying down in her bed. Kyoko's belly was even bigger. The large jiggly orb of fat had forced the zipper on her shirt open and caused the button in her skirt to pop off. She rubbed her big belly as she burped loudly, hoping to ease her tummyache. She slapped her big belly causing it to jiggle and wobble. She belted out a massive belch. Such a completely unladylike and uncharacteristic belch caused the fat detective to blush heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko snapped back to reality. \"O-Of-Of course I'm not. Don't be ridiculous.\" Kyoko said. Her clam demeanor disappeared. \"I'm not a glutton and I know how to stay in shape. Besides, I'm not even hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko's tummy immediately growled loudly. She blushed even harder. Makoto let out a friendly chuckle at this, which caused Kyoko to let out a small chuckle herself. Even she could find the humor in this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I could go for a snack. Thanks for the food, Makoto.\" Kyoko said she open a bag of chips and began eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Makoto replied as he began eating a slice of pizza. He was pretty happy to see that his plan to get his friend to lighten up had worked.</span></div></div>",

Kirigiri\u2019s scent smells lovely and delicious. He wonders what kind of shampoo his girlfriend uses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she backs away, Makoto reaches for another slice but finds the box empty. He turns to Kirigiri, who won\u2019t meet his gaze, already looking for more food. She had the same stoic expression but it doesn\u2019t look as intimidating covered in pizza sauce. She reached out her gloved, tomato covered hand and grabbed a couple sandwiches. She open her mouth and bite into them. As one disappeared, another one is already in her other hand, being brought up to her face and being chomped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto wasn\u2019t even hungry. He stared at Kirigiri, who was strangely determined to finish all the food on the table. She doesn\u2019t even seem to notice Makoto not eating anymore. Makoto brought this much food as a safety measure, in a scenario which he (and possibly his girlfriend Kirigiri) need to lock themselves in a room for several days. This is the Killing Game Highschool. Makoto was trying to play with Kirigiri, now that they have gotten to know each better. He didn\u2019t know Kirigiri would take his joking seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, Makoto sat, memorized, watching Kirigiri consume his emergence food rations. She has eaten 1/3 of the food, chewing and swallowing potions down her throat. He looked at her mouth, feeling strange, watching her slurped down a pot of noodles. Cook and seasoned, but meant for five people. Makoto watched the big lumps travel down Kirigiri\u2019s throat and finding its place in her swelling stomach. Kirigiri doesn\u2019t seem to know, or mind Makoto seeing her not waste any of this delicious food and consume them, as she stood tall right in front of him. Makoto was  partially blocking the table from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes groan with strain, till some of them couldn\u2019t take it and ripped. Kirigiri\u2019s naked stomach expanded outwardly in Makoto\u2019s face, bouncing with food as she chugged on a gallon of milk. Some milk escapes pass her lips and ran down her body and over her stomach. Makoto watch speechless as the hole made by her bellybutton grew bigger as her fattening stomach bounce closer to Makoto with each of Kirigiri\u2019s swallows and little burps she makes in her gloves out of politeness. The milk ran over her tummy and drops were collected in her bellybutton, which Makoto could see is forming a little puddle in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Makoto stares at her naked, fat stomach expanding towards him, something in Makoto\u2019s pants is expanding as well. But it\u2019s not as soft as Kirigiri\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, after swallowing half of the food on the table, Kirigiri pause to take a breath. She hasn\u2019t been moving quickly or frantically. Just in a nice, methodical pace as if she was on a hunt for a killer. Her expression hasn\u2019t change from her usual calm, stoic self, but her body movements showed her being very eager to get back to her feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri tried to reach out for the next food but it was out of reach. Strange, cause it should be within reach. Ignoring the obvious, that her stomach as grown to almost the size of a beach ball, except fill fat and food, Kirigiri grab the table and lifted herself on up, on top of her belly. Her leg swing at Makoto, momentarily showing a crack in her calm demeanor, before grabbing the ham and proceeds to make it part of her growing fat. It\u2019s hard to tell if she is realizing what she is doing at the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto jumps off of the chair, avoiding Kirigiri\u2019s leg. Despite how frighteningly huge Kirigiri\u2019s stomach is, her limbs retained the same proportions. Probably because the food needs to digest first. Makoto stand behind Kirgiri and watch her continue to eat the next half of the food. Makoto was about to say something, as he was growing concern, till Kirigiri lean forward on her stomach after swallowing the ham, and went grabbing for the burgers. Leaning forward, her skirt flips ups and her body raised her big ass in the air for Makoto to see. And this size of her big ass is before she digests the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto, already with as boner from watching Kirigiri chewing, slurping and swallowing the food to increase her massive stomach, is now being invited to no longer just to watch. Makoto still standing unsure what to do, gets an angry grunt from Kirigiri, sliding a fifth burger down her throat. She turned her head around slightly to Makoto, with a look of impatience, and shakes her ass softly side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Makoto do?</span></div></div>",

I couldn't eat another bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto and Kyoko leaned back in their seats, rubbing their big bellies, completely stuffed. They had eaten the entire massive feast Makoto had brought and their big bellies were proof of that. Makoto's hoodie and Kyoko's shirt were riding up on their bloated middles, completely incapable of containing the masses of flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both pretty impressed with how much they had eaten and how large their bellies had gotten. Their bellies were pressing against the hems of Makoto's pants and Kyoko's skirt, straining the buttons on them almost to the point of popping off. Which also would've impressed the two close friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's a tie, right?\" Makoto asked as he rubbed his stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah.\" Kyoko replied. She really wished that Makoto couldn't see her rubbing her bloated tummy. \"I don't know how you managed to talk me into that eating contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud \u2013ping!- sound interrupted their thoughts. They looked down and discovered that it was sound of the button on their pants/skirt popping off. Not only did the buttons pop off, though, but their creamy stomach flesh audibly pushed each of their zippers down. The doughy adipose needed as much room as possible, and with the buttons out of the way, the metallic teeth of the zippers stood no chance to fight the onslaught of flab. The two overfed teens both blushed. Makoto could tell that Kyoko was a lot more embarrassed then him. He decided to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to do this again sometime. It was really -UUURRRP-!\" Makoto blushed heavily. He wasn't really big on manners but he didn't want to burp right next to Kyoko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto!\" Kyoko said, glaring at Makoto. \"Mind your manners! UUUURRRP!\" Kyoko immediately slapped a hand over her mouth, blushing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto and Kyoko stared at each other in silence, their faces blushing scarlet. They soon burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse us!\" Makoto said, still laughing a little. He had a big dorky smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no idea we were so skilled at belching.\" Kyoko said, chuckling. She was smiling like Makoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't either. Wanna see who can burp the loudest? I'm up for a burping contest if you are.\" Makoto suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, Makoto. I don't I'm quite ready for that yet.\" Kyoko said, smiling warmly.  \"Another time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking forward to it.\" Makoto said. He always loved it when Kyoko loosened up and they did something fun. He had a feeling this wasn't going to be the last time they stuffed themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko giggled at her best friend's enthusiasm. She always loved Makoto's friendly and optimistic personality. Makoto was such a dork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of the close friends chatting, Kyoko's tummy gurgled loudly. Kyoko put a hand of her overfed tummy and burped softly in to her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Are you feeling alright, Kyoko?\" Makoto asked, a worried look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y -UUURRP!- Yeah. I've just got a little stomachache.\" Kyoko answered as she looked down at her belly in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My stomach isn't -UUURRRP!- exactly agreeing with me either. Oof.\" Makoto said as he rubbed his tummy. \"You know, a good belly rub will help us feel better. But, uh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\" Kyoko had a feeling she wasn't going to like the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're going to have to burp. A lot.\" Makoto smiled sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko groaned, she didn't like the answer. \"Well, I suppose there are worse ways to relieve indigestion,\" she said, giving a reluctant sigh. \"Logical too, I\u2019ll give you that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, Kyoko and Makoto began the process of\u2026 expelling the gas from their turbulent tummies. For the next three minutes, they belted out some of the loudest belches of their lives, some powerful enough to even send vibrations through the air. They were massaging and pressing their bellies to get all the best burps out possible, until at last, there was hardly anything left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo. Much -UUURRRRP- much better.\" Kyoko said, a pleased expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I didn\u2019t know you \u2013UURRRAAP- had all that in you, Kyoko,\u201d Makoto said, a bit of a bemused expression on his face. \u201cI think you might\u2019ve outdone me there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, st-stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko and Makoto felt their bellies gurgle and pressure build up in their chests. They needed to burp and it was going to be a big one. They smiled at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko and Makoto simultaneously let out a massive belch. They both burst out laughing. It was the type of laugh that lasted for a good ten seconds, a bellyful one that made each teen red in the face from the exertion. Eventually, however, it died down, leaving the two in silence to reflect upon what had just happened. Despite the fullness in their stomachs, they both felt quite a warm and accomplished feeling emanating from their taut middles, one neither had felt in a long time. Both Makoto and Kyoko caressed their bellies, the pleasure of the warm meals settling in their stomachs helping to put them at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this was awesome.\" Makoto said as he slapped his big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, I suppose it was rather enjoyable,\u201d his silver-headed friend said, looking off to the side. \u201cI actually wouldn\u2019t mind\u2026 doing this again.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a certain Kirigiri, things had been somewhat strange in the past few weeks. Not only had the lunchroom at the already prestigious school become renovated to serve a bigger variety of foods, but there was something else quite pressing. Naegi Makoto, her partner of sorts and actual friend had gone missing in the past few weeks. Now as Kirigiri investigated, it seemed as if no one know who she was talking about, almost as if Naegi never existed in the first place. As Kirigiri herself was quite wise for her age, she managed to figure out that the young man had been abducted for whatever reason. Occasionally she would investigate the school and the surrounding cities but found very little clues as to what happened. Still, she wouldn't give up, she couldn't give up on him. Class would go on and eventually would end, signaled by the loud ringing of the school bells. She gathered her belongings and stood up, ready to go out into the field and investigate some more. Walking through the hallways, she heard a rather alarming noise. It was almost like a whistle and caused her to look in the direction of a classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is a trap.\" she said aloud to herself, finding it to be well beneath her intellectual level. Still, this was more than a trap, it was a way to get her attention. Someone wanted her to go in and she had to do it in order to find more information about the Naegi situation. Taking in a deep breath, she slowly entered  the room, hearing a sharp *thunk* behind her. Of course the door would lock, that's how these things worked of course. Taking a good look of her surroundings, it looked to be a normal classroom, but the way that the desks were arranged was somewhat strange. The desks placed in a circle, each of them had a cake on top. All the cakes looked to be different styles and types, each with a single lit candle on top. On the far side of the room there were a number of desks stacked on each other to make a stand of sorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Kirigiri.\" said a voice coming from the stack of desks. Her eyes widening, she quickly turned her head up to see a figure standing on top of the desks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi?\" she asked, coming closer and forming a soft smile of sorts. Before she could get close enough, Naegi kicked a few desks down, falling right in front of the surprised girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah now, that's a bit too close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi, I could have been hurt by that. What's going on?\" she asked, her eyes narrowing. Now this individual sounded like Naegi, and had an identical appearance to him as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't really tell you now can I? For now, focus on getting out of this room. A few hints, doors and windows are locked tight, Nothing short of an artillery strike or army grade explosives will get through those.\" said Naegi as he was rather proud of his own handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi, what is going on?\" she asked once more, feeling a bit of anger boiling up inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I can't tell you, it'll ruin our fun. Just focusing on escaping, shouldn't be too hard for you right? I mean you are a genius aren't you? Or was that just a bold claim on your part?\" said the young man with a smirk. Deciding that he had said enough to the purple haired girl, he jumped off of the stack, causing the rest of the desks to fall down and create a barrier between himself and Kirigiri. With that, he ran out the room, another loud *thunk* heard. Kirigiri stood in the middle of the room, trying to process just what had happened. She let out a sigh, it was no use trying to think of him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get to the bottom of this room I suppose.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Naegi ran out of the room, he removed his phone from his pocket and ducked into another empty classroom. Dialing some numbers, he called a rather important person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is set up. This'll buy us at least 20 minutes. Is that enough to do what you need to do?\" After having a small conversation with the other person on the line, he hung up and headed towards the school exit. Everything would be fine for the day and he was no longer needed. With a small grin, he walked right out the doors of the rather impressive school and left, blending in with all the students in the off chance that Kirigiri escaped without solving the puzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to go scope out my new apartment I suppose.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Kirigiri, she was currently still in the locked room. Giving the room a thorough inspection, she came to a few conclusions. At the other door was a digital number reading installed onto it that read 106+4. On the ground near the door was a silver plate and when she stepped on it, a number read 106. Inspecting the door once more, there was a keyhole right about the doorknob.  She looked up and also noticed a camera that was focusing intently on the area.  Going back to the middle of the room, she found a note on a desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The key is in one of these cakes. Have fun.' Reading it over just in case there was a secret message to it, she gave a glance over to all the cakes in the room. Piecing together all the clues in the room, it became quite clear to her. The number on the door represented her weight, the four represented how much heavier she needed to be to leave, due to the scale on the ground. Since the key was a factor, both would be needed to leave the room.  Due to the camera aimed at the door, she wouldn't be able to cheat either.  With a heavy sigh, she removed her jacket and gloves, revealing the scars she held on both hands. Since no one was around, they wouldn't need to be hidden. Removing her blouse and tie as well, revealed the lavender undershirt she wore underneath. With the preparations made, she let out another sigh, it wasn't exactly going to be pleasant. Going for the first cake, she dug her hands in, getting frosting and such all over herself. Continuing to search in the cheesecake, nothing was found. With that, she began to shovel the cake into her mouth, cursing Naegi for not providing her with utensils of any sort. The taste was sweet and made her taste buds flare up, but Kirigiri was someone who was in control, someone who didn't overindulge like any other girl. Finishing up the cheesecake, she let out a small moan as she patted her stomach. It was still quite flat, but she was starting to feel a bit full. Kirigiri continued on, focusing first on finding the key and eating the cakes second. On the fifth cake, she had yet to find the key but continued to eat, a nice layer of frosting on her lips and cheeks, Sitting down at the desk, she let out a small belch as she leaned back into her seat. Placing her arms on her belly, it was now quite rigid, proof of how much she had just eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this does it with the weight.\" she muttered as she attempted to sit up, only to find herself weak and sit back down. Damn that Naegi for making her eat so much!  With another attempt, she was successful and stood up, heading to the door. Standing on the scale, she saw 106+3. Only one pound until she met the first condition. With that, she went back at it, going through three more cakes until she finally found the key. It was a rather standard one, the only remarkable thing of note was that it was colored black and white. As she had gotten through at least two more cakes, she was sure that she met both conditions. Heading back to the door, the screen read 106+5. With a sigh of relief, she used the key and turned the knob and the door opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally.\" said the exhausted detective as she went to go gather her things. Her hands and face still covered in frosting, she looked to the rest of the cakes in the room, there were still about twenty more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one more wouldn't hurt...\" she said as she licked her lips clean. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking the dimming streets with a pair of keys in his hand, Naegi pondered about to see which building his apartment was situated in. A major benefit to his actions was that his mysterious superior was incredibly wealthy, having connections from all over that allowed them to do pretty much anything they desired. It was a strong reason why the academy was suddenly serving larger and fattier foods than usual with no questions asked. Naegi was promised that a lot of rewards would be heading his way for his hard work behind the scenes in fulfilling the unknown individual's master plan, the first of these being a brand new apartment, which they assured would be top notch in both quality and space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streetlights flickered on as Naegi searched about, noting how late it was getting. He was surprised he hadn't found his apartment sooner, after all he left to find it as soon as he'd done his duty with Kirigiri. With only the street name and the building name, both of which were unfamiliar to him, it was a bit of a task finding the apartment. Naegi simply assumed it was to make the location as inconspicuous as possible. He'd been warned by his superior that there were more than the meddling detective on their case, and though while they assured him they were taking care of them, they still warned him to keep on his toes in case they found out he was in on the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like forever, the building was before him. The inconspicuous part seemed right, the building was as boring and plain as one would expect from any old apartment district. Literally the street was nothing but apartment buildings. He entered inside easily, without the need of a code or needing to ring a buzzer, given just how cheap the building was. He looked at his keys, giving him the number 43 as his designated room. Naegi followed by the stairs, noting the first digit represented the floor number the room was on. It didn't take long for him to get there, a little relived given how much walking he'd done that day. Noting the room labelled 43, he unlocked the door to enter his new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst impressions were highly positive. His boss wasn't kidding when they talked about size and quality. The living room was right before him, and it was massive. Well, massive for apartment size anyway. A large leather couch, which looked like it'd been bought that day was positioned perfectly in front of a massive TV, with some pamphlets by it side confirming it supported both HD and 3D. Even the walls and floors looked good, the floor being a soft ruby red carpet along with the walls being painted a variety of refreshing deep colours. To the side, as part of the same room was a mini kitchen, which Naegi moved over to get a better look. As he moved over, he noticed a doorway to the side of the kitchen, which was likely the bedroom, likely with a bathroom as part of it given how it was the only doorway in the room. The Kitchen had everything he expected, an oven, a microwave, plenty of pantries and of course a pretty oversized fridge-freezer. Impressed by it's size, he took a look inside to get a scope of how big it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, it was actually fully stocked, bursting from top to bottom with food. However, something seemed off. Yes it was full of food, but it was no essentials. None of the basic foods good for cooking were inside. To put it bluntly, the entire fridge was packed with junk food and sugary treats. Chocolate bars filled up a fair amount of the fridge, along with a multitude of cakes and desserts, topped with pastries, cans of whipped cream and icing, along with several 3 litre bottles of soda in the side. Confused, Naegi decided to check the freezer. That was full too, this time with plenty of pizzas, whole steaks and other meats, and an entire section dedicated to ice cream, various flavours with many tubs to contain them. Naegi moved onwards to the pantires, which low and behold were stuffed too. Mass bags of chips and snack foods littered them, all of them distinctively western. It seemed nothing in the kitchen wasn't junk food, baffling Naegi on the choice to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressed by my food stash?\" A feminine voice called from behind him. Turning around quickly, Naegi found himself face to face with Kirigiri. Or at least, what he assumed was Kirigiri. She wore the same clothes, she had the same hairstyle, her face and voice matched up with her too. Only this girl was significantly different to what he associated with Kirigiri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost apparent of all was this girl was fat. Very fat. Easily in the 300 pound category. With adorable chubby cheeks with a clear double chin, the obese girl was lying with her back to the wall, one meaty leg standing her up whilst the other was bent, her foot against the wall as she lay against in. In her hand was a family sized chocolate bar, already partially eaten, which she continued to munch away at, her lips stained lightly with melted chocolate. She licked them clean with a few sweeps with her tongue, her eyes staring directly at Naegi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for a growing girl like me.\u201d She used her non-chocolate eating hand to rub her stomach, a massive doughy affair separated into two thick rolls, barely contained by a tight fitting blouse, their buttons strained as they just so managed to hold together, the exposed pale skin of her gut being slightly stroked by her thick fingers as she rubbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi merely looked on in awe at the plus size Kirigiri, who was now on the move, cramming the last of the chocolate into her mouth, staining her cheeks a little with smudged chocolate. Licking her fingers clean, she moved over to one of the lower cupboards, her eyes unmoving on Naegi as she made sure he was right behind her. That\u2019s when he got to see it. Bending over, he was in full view of her mighty rear, two grand asscheeks wobbling with every slight movement whilst he got a clear view of her panties too, a royal purple colour with thin lace and tiny black frills along with edges, with ornate style patterns adorned along it. It was far, far too small for her ass, they only barely covered a quarter of her rear as she was bent over. He was just beginning to notice that the skirt of hers was a lot shorter than the kind Kirigiri usually wore\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was just bizzare, like an odd caricature of Kirigiri. It wasn't just the fat she was triple the weight of what she usually was, but her looks were strange too. It was almost like she'd been put through a negative filter, a reverse of Kirigiri's usual looks. Rather than light shining hair, it was jet black, as dark as it could get. What would be a white blouse was instead just as black, with slots of white creamy flesh where the buttons wouldn't connect. The jacket was a deep yellow rather than purple, not that it helped to fit on her fattened figure any better. The tie which was nestled snugly between her chest was blue rather than red, and everything black was the purest of whites. Her gloves, skirt and boots were all white as white could be, making an odd contrast to what Naegi was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out she\u2019d not been looking for food to eat from that cupboard, she\u2019d be straight up eating out of there. Chomping down on the last cupcake as she flicked a sprinkle from her hands, she was getting quite close to Naegi now. In her other hand, she held a thick creamy eclair, oozing slightly onto her gloved hand as she moved over in her heavy waddling stride, eyes locked with Naegi. He moved back until he backed up into the bed, forced to sit down as \"Kirigiri's\" belly bumped into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had my eyes on you for a while Naegi.\" She licked her lips as she took the eclair and dropped it between her cleavage. \"I have all sorts I want to do with you.\" Proceeding to use her hands, she slowly pushed her breasts together, squashing the eclair flat and letting the cream dribble out of the end, some falling to the ground and some splattering onto her face, to which she quickly licked it off and gobbled up the squashed eclair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, with surprising agility, Naegi was pounced by her, her belly crushing into him with her breasts hanging over his face, her pudgy hands pressed onto his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now Naegi, I have a lot to show you...\"</span></div></div>",

She was in acting the first step, switching rooms with Makoto, she would then somehow find a way to entice Leon into entering the room, after that she would kill him, simple as that, but as soon as she opened the door to Naegi's room, she felt something deep in her stomach, and when she saw Makoto, it turned into a fluttering in her chest.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       A thought came to mind, \"I can't do this, but, I'm already in the room, what should I say,\" she thought. Then, Makoto's voice woke her up from being lost in thought, \"Sayaka, what's wrong?\"he asked in a worried tone, which sent her chest fluttering into full on pounding. Suddenly, she knew what she should say, it was what she was going to say at first, but , if she could tweek it a bit, she may also gain sometching other than her plans sucess.<br>\r\n    \"I-it's, well, it's, um,\" she said in the tone she would have used if she continued her plan.\"What is it?\" Said Naegi in the same worried tone, but a bit more serious. \"I-I'm sorry it's just that, we'll, can I sleep on your room tonight?\" She said while her face unintentionally blushed.\"Wh-what?!?!?\" Said Naegi unable to hide his suprised, while his face too, was suddenly flushed the color red.\"I-I don't mean it in an, um weird kind of way! It's just,\"she paused,\"That I'm scared, I-Im just scared about everything, and I don't want to stay in my room.\" She said with real nervousness.\"And your someone I can really trust, and I mean really trust, so please let me stay in your room this one night!\" She said while bowing her head, trying to hide her blush.<br>\r\n Naegi, unsurprisingly, was speechless, \"Um, o-okay, I guess, if it's okay with you.\" He said shakily, most men would jump ato the chance to have an idol spend the night with them, but, Sayaka was a friend, a cute one, but not his type, she could become his type, but he didn't want to do that to her without her volition. Sayaka then looked up quickly and near screamed \"Thank you,\" over and over again, because, she would get to spend the night with the man whos thought alone, convinced her out of murder, and made her chest pound so very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      During the night, Sayaka awoke to mumbling next to her on the bed (which she had snuck onto after Naegi fell asleep) from Makoto himself,\" o-oh, Harumi-San,\" he said while seeming to form, a very wide figure, Sayaka was shocked to her this, and soon thought of a thousand ways to hurt this \"Harumi-San,\" when Naegi said again,\"Oh, just Nokia, okay,\" he said with a bit if drool running down his mouth. Sayaka, had heard that name before, it was the name of a very popular BBW , Nokia Harumi, but couldn't believe that Naegi was dreaming of her, yet, the figure Naegi was shaping was quite wide, and he seemed to be very \"interested\" in her, so she thought, does Naegi like fat girls, (he did) she came to this conclusion, and thought, I can use this, maybe if I get chubby, he would like me more, not fat, just a bit chubby to attract Makoto, (we know she's gonna get obese) so she resolved to gain weight, so right now she would....</span></div></div>",

When she got to the cafeteria, she opened up a carton of ice cream, and made a sundae that was roughly half her size. The sundae was drenched from head to toe with chocolate syrup and whipped cream. It was decorated with pocky, and it had a cherry on top. The sundae was much larger than anything she had eaten in month's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began eating the sundae slowly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While she was already feeling rather full, Sayaka decided to continue stuffing herself. She went over to the kitchen, her new potbelly making walking a bit difficult, and got herself what was particularly a feast made just for her. It was so massive that she had to take multiple trips between her table and her kitchen to place it all on her table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the singer laid a huge feast that consisted of pizza, ice cream, cookies, hamburgers, hot dogs, donuts and more. She doubted that she could eat all of it but she was going to try her best. Sayaka unbuttoned her skirt's button and undid it's zipper before she began digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with a hamburger, her career meant that she had to constantly watch her weight and diet so stuff like hamburgers were strictly off limits. Now was the perfect time to try them and as soon as she took her first bite, Sayaka was hooked. She quickly finished her first burger and then took a few sips from a bottle of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why so many people get fat off of these, they're really good.\" Sayaka said aloud to herself. She then began eating her next burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the nearby main hall, Kyoko Kirigiri was conducting her late night investigation of the area. She didn't expect to find anything she and the others might've overlooked during their earlier searches but it couldn't hurt to search one more time. It wasn't like she had anything better to do. Plus, there was also a chance of her coming across someone else who was breaking the nighttime rule, which would give her an insight into their character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far her search was proving fruitless, as she expected. She was about to head back to her room and after write another entry in her journal before getting some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks this was a waste of time. Can't say I expected it to be anything else.\" She said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she was startled by the sound of a loud belch. Needless to say, Kyoko was quite curious as to who was responsible for it. She walked towards the cafeteria 's entrance and hid  next to it. She peeked her head out to see Sayaka gorging herself on a truly absurd amount of food in the cafeteria, which was the last thing she was expecting to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayaka was someone Kyoko never would've expected to pig out, given how well she took care of her body as the Ultimate Pop Sensation. She was expecting Toko, Hifumi, Aoi, or even Makoto to be the one who released the belch. Yet it was the very polite and pettie Sayaka Maizono who was responsible for such a loud burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" Sayaka said with a red face before she resumed her gorging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko kept watching the blue-haired singer eat, she was fascinated by seeing such an out-of-character action for Sayaka being done with so much gusto. After finishing her fourth burger, Sayaka decided to try some of the other food and she began eating a slice of pizza, which she found to be incredibly tasty. After that, she began devouring some hot dogs, which she washed down with some soda and water before moving onto the cookies. The rate at which she consumed the sweets was truly impressive, the bluenette was practically inhaling them. She was certainly showing off her love of sweets to Kyoko, albeit unintentionally. From then, she began actively alternating between the many different food available, sometimes she wouldn't even finishing what she currently eating before taking a bite out of something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sayaka ate more and more, her belly grew bigger and bigger. Big enough that by the time she was halfway done with her feast, it had become the size the a basketball. It was a good thing she had unbutton her skirt beforehand, otherwise her gut would've just popped off the button. But there was still an article of clothing that was proving to be too small for her belly, her shirt. With some reluctance despite believing that she was alone, Sayaka unzipped her shirt up to just below her chest, completely barring her swollen gut. After giving another loud burp, which was followed by another \"Excuse me!\", she returned to her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kyoko kept watching the odd spectacle before her, she used her detective reasoning to try to deduce what the motive was for Sayaka to do something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could this just simply comfort food? No, this is far too much food for just that. The only possible explanation is that she is trying to gain weight. But why?\" Kyoko thought to herself. She spent a few moments trying to come up with a motivation to no avail. \"It looks like I know a lot less about Sayaka Maizono then I thought. I suppose it was foolish of me to assume that I knew anything about her. After all, we only met three days ago and we haven't even held one conversation together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Sayaka finally finished her feast. She leaned back her chair and let out a gigantic belch, resting her hands on her big belly. Her stomach was truly a massive thing now. It was a big, round ball completely filled to the brim with food. It was the size of an over-inflated beach ball<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuggh\u2026 I couldn't eat another bite. UUUURRRP!\" Sayaka moaned as she rubbed her swollen belly. \"I feel like I'm going to \u2013UUURRRP- explode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe singer gave her belly a small pat, as if to confirm it was real and not some hallucination. It felt so weird to have a belly this big and it felt even weirder to be glad to see it. \"I gotta say, I didn't think I would be able to eat \u2013UURRP- all that.\" The signer said with a smile as she looked down her tummy, giving the round orb a massage. Being able to eat that much actually felt a bit rewarding to Sayaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the Ultimate Pop Sensation rub her bloated gut and belt out massive belches, Kyoko knew exactly what she was going to write about in her journal. She then sighed as she realized that this was the highlight of her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a hobby.\"</span></div></div>",

Nearly a week had passed since the Super High-School Level Swimmer and her fellow classmates were locked away by the monstrous Monokuma and his unknown master. His offer was sadistically simple; all they had to do was get away with the murder of a fellow student and they would receive a way out, no questions asked. No one had taken his offer yet, thankfully, but it was only a matter of time until one of them snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment the young athlete found herself in her dorm room, locked away in it's cell-like environment. Even with the numerous mementos and personal objects that her captors had provided, Aoi still had not adjusted to the alien environment of her sleeping area. It was for that reason that she was awake at the crack of dawn, reclining gently on her uncomfortable bed. Her mind was filled with nervous thoughts on the future that lay ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a light rapping at her chamber door that finally broke Aoi from her despair-filled thoughts. Even though the group had agreed to never answer their doors before the official opening message from Monokuma, something about it seemed to hold her curiosity. She felt that she NEEDED to know what was beyond the impenetrable slab of metal. Therefore, against her better judgement, she rose from her relaxation and approached, ready to see what was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Before the knocker is revealed, though, there is one important issue. How will Aoi gain her weight?]</span></div></div>",

With several millions of yen all in neatly made piles, tied together with ribbon and firmly placed into her oversized purse, it was yet another inevitable victory for the naturally talented girl. It had been a little below the usual stakes she was accustomed to, but nevertheless a victory was a victory. And nothing was more important to \"Celes\" than knowing she had came out as the victor whilst her opponents would need to consider filing for bankruptcy. Winning was as sweet as honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving escorted herself out through the back door of the establishment, she made her way through the dimly lit side streets. People tended to be sore losers when it came to something such as poker and would often get their little buddies to help them relive some stress from the victors, so Celes knew it to be smarter to take the lesser known routes that any unwanted assailants wouldn't try to use. Now a fair distance from the place the game had taken place, Celes began to make her way through the regular streets, certain that she was in the clear from any attackers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was deathly late at night, just coming past 1am by then. Giving out a long yawn, Celes thought towards how she'd even manage to stay awake at school tomorrow. She had even considered not coming to the poker game that night, aware that she needed to go to school the preceding day. However, she succumbed to her own desires and decided against not attending. Thinking over the night, Celes felt it was the right choice, having some extra cash in her pocket now. She continued onwards through the near abandoned city streets, only the occasional flicker of a nearby car or a sole light turned on in a house to even give a signal of life nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was fairly cold, a chilly breeze fluttering about her elongated black drills. Her already pale skin meant she didn't show any signs of the coldness, but in truth Celes felt bothered by the chills of the night. Not wanting to be out too much longer, she opted for a quicker route home by using her knowledge of the surrounding area. Turning a corner so to enter a back-alley once more, she left the artificial lights of the paved streets and entered the darkness of the worn side route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chills only got worse in the secluded walls, much to Celes' dismay. The narrow passage led to the wind being streamlined, an array of freezing blasts brushed into her face. Her mouth scrunched up and her nose wrinkled. She picked her pace up, the sooner she was out of the cold the better. It was a shorter route, so she felt it was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she heard something. Celes felt it typical to be followed into such a dark passage, she even admired that one of her rivals was this determined to follow her all the way out here and hide out in the route. How they knew the way she'd take or whether it was pure luck was unknown, but she needn't have time to question it. Turning around, she looked about in the pitch black with her red intimidating eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw nothing through the darkness, but she still heard the sounds. Not a footstep, not heavy breathing, nothing she expected. It instead sounded like something being clanged together gently, like two pieces of metal tinking against one another. Celes glanced from left to right, not seeing a single thing. She found it strange, so she stepped about slowly. She was not one to avoid her adversaries, however skewered her thought process may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds grew louder, the gentle metallic noises seemingly getting closer. Celes moved onwards, sure she'd see the figure if she kept going onwards. That was until her slightly outstretched hand met the cold wall before her. She didn't expect it, sure that the noise was very much near to her. That is until she realised that she had been wrong. The noise was from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around as fast as she could, her angered prepared look turned quickly to a small smile. It was a face she recognised, one she had seen many times in the past. Though, something felt off about this face, which see soon realised about. Her confusion only lasted a second, as by the next moment in time she suffered a sharp blow to the head, sending her unconscious in a single swoop. Falling to the floor and losing vision, she continued to hear the very same sounds, the familiar person looming over her until she finally was out cold.</span></div></div>",

The pipes bared the school insignia and the floor had the same design. She stood up, only then realizing that she had been placed in a chair. Her purse was next to her, but it still had all it's contents safely inside. This troubled Celes. Whoever did this wanted something other than her money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat troubled her more was the lack of anything keeping her from escaping. She was not bound to the chair and the doorway into the hall was unguarded. Whoever did this was confident in their ability to keep her there, unless they don't mean to in which case why go through all this? Furthermore, Celes had been in an abscure, unspecific part of town when she had attacked, and since she was in the school, she thought, her attacker knows her specifically. Thus whoever wanted her down here either was extremely lucky to find her or had a wide range of influence and could hear from allies where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all in a rush the memory came back to her of who the attacker was.

Clearly this completely normal, nothing out of the ordinary young man was simply walking to school, nothing special about him at all, not to mention his crippling lack of a Stand. He had stayed up late the night before chatting up some details about a recent 'case' with his 'partner.' They had a weird relationship of sorts, she was the ace detective of the school, coming from a long line of famous sleuths and he was the unassuming average joe. Still, they worked well together and had solved a variety of cases for both students and faculty members. The young man could hardly recall how all of this started, but he went along with it, made him feel useful for once. Plus having a 'normal' viewpoint on certain things certainly helped as well. His partner could be rather dense when it came to certain things, like how she could forget how rummaging through a dumpster is not lady-like behavior or how people actually spend time together to 'have fun.' Shaking these rather unpleasant thoughts out of his mind, he picked up the pace as he didn't wish to be late for class. Being tardy not only awarded one points off, but also a rather arousing speech by the infamous world level school prefect. Shuddering at such a thought, it took him about ten more minutes before he finally reached the gates of Hope Academy, a den that housed the most perfect and skilled students from throughout the country. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just on time!' he thought to himself in a relieved manner. Passing by the idle students in the hall, he reached his homeroom class and settled down right at his desk, letting out a deep sigh of relief as he relaxed his tense body. Looking around, it seemed that most of the students were already there including his partner. Walking up to him, deep purple eyes examined his current status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi, good morning. You look rather exhausted. I suggest you should work on going to bed at a more suitable time.\" she said in her monotone voice. Naegi controlled the need to sigh at such a comment and he simply nodded, letting the ace detective have her way once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Kirigiri. Did you manage to get more info about the case? I did a bit of research after our talk, so I wanna compare notes I guess.\" The long haired girl nodded and looked to have the slightest hint of a smile on her normally inexpressive face.  While Naegi could not tell, she was actually quite happy that Naegi was doing some information gathering of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, let us compare notes at lunch.\" Before Naegi could reply, the first bell rang, signaling the start of class. With a nod, Kirigiri went back to her desk as Naegi let out a yawn. This was going to be a rather long day for him. </span></div></div>",

The clock never seemed to move fast enough, time crawling at a snail's pace. Throughout the day he endured various prods and pokes from Kirigiri to keep him awake and focused, not a word passed or eye contect but just the pokes. Naegi just wanted to sleep, but he at least appreciated her help. He knew if he even dared sleep a second Ishimaru would be all over him with lectures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for him, lunch was soon around the corner. The moment the bell ran, Naegi joined Kirigiri by the door of the classroom so to walk with her over to the lunch room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think 26 seconds was your personal best at staying awake. I wasn't counting all the time though.\" Kirigiri said as they walked, a small grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely it's better than that then if you weren't looking the whole time? Give me some credit!\" He added in response, his voice somewhat panicked as if he took it seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably right. Maybe it's 30 seconds.\" While he knew she was taking jabs at him for not sleeping enough, Naegi couldn't help but smirk. After all, it was Kirigiri telling jokes, not the most common of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the lunch room, everyone was present and accounted for. Fukawa was making lovestruck eyes at Togami, Hagakure was ranting on to anyone nearby about how he successfully predicted that aliens landed in his backyard and Oogami was downing several cups of protein related drinks. However, something caught Kirigiri's eye. Noticing who was in line for their lunch, she walked over to the line with Naegi following in her step, a bit delayed due to his grogginess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri stood next to Celes in the line, she waiting patiently as Yamada grabbed several helpings. As Naegi caught up, Kirigiri spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Celes. Awaiting in line I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Celes turned around. From here, Naegi could see why she was so interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes I am. Today there is a fine selection.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sporting a rather painful looking black eye on her left, with splotches of purple around it. Her left eye squinted slightly as if pained by it, but despite that she had still applied a plentiful supply of make up as well as adding her red contacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celes...what happened to you?\" Naegi questioned, which he assumed was the reason Kirigiri took note of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles touched her left eye, flinching slightly as she did so. \"Oh, this? Simple, I just took a tumble and my eye bashed into a table. It's nothing really, it'll clear up in a few days.\" She gave a reassuring smile as she turned back around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi turned to Kirigiri, her face looking in it's inquisitive form. \"Had a hunch about something?\" He questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just curious, is all. Nothing strange about it though, seeing how confident she was in her answer.\" Kirigiri responded, gloved hand of her chin. She soon left her chin alone and awaiting in line as Celes was next to be served.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The boy was a teen that was around the age of the others and was face-first in a book, which was normal behavior for himself. He would occasionally take a bite to eat of his lunch, but was mostly focused on his literature. Across from him sat a girl with two long braids going down her head and wide glasses. Unlike the other, most of her attention was settled on her meal and she would occasionally glance up at the boy, only to bring her head back down when he would notice. The two had been like this for quite some time, her following him around like a 'lovesick' puppy and him letting her be. It wasn't that she was deplorable to him, or anything like that, he had to admit the girl was 'cute' in her own way, despite her not showering regularly or bothering to fix her unkempt hair. Still, to someone like him, the world renown prodigy, if he were to reciprocate any feeling, they would have to be of status as well. Which is what the girl had, her own status is what allowed her to come to the school in the first place. However, there was still one critical piece missing from this picture. His own thoughts interrupted, he looked towards the girl who had just asked him a question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Togami, I've come a-across a few more books that would interest you, I think. D-Do you want me to give you t-the list later?\" asked the bespectacled girl, stammering and looking away from the young man as she spoke to him. At times, she would find it hard to even look at him when they spoke. Of course, it would be incredibly hard to not find this action to be incredibly cute, so the scion had to fight back his own blush. Still, this was a good record for her, she had spoken to him three times so far this day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, give it to me by the end of the day.\" he said, not bothering to look away from the awkward girl. She gave a somewhat weird smile as she giggled strangely to herself. Indeed, this one had a rather long road ahead of her towards becoming more 'normal.'  Taking another bite from his meal, he noticed that she had barely picked at hers, something that she tended to do very often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't I already told you that I like those who bother to finish their meals?\" he said in a scolding tone. Shocked from his words, the girl nodded and began to eat her meal properly, a bit happy that the scion was 'caring' for her. With a sigh, the blonde boy went back to his book. trying to finish a bulk of it before the period ended. </span></div></div>",

He was certain he'd be much more refreshed for tomorrow thanks to his added nap alongside his natural sleep, which would lead to a much easier time as well as no jabs from Kirigiri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day rolled along. Naegi was right, he felt much better having slept for much longer, his eyes not drooping constantly and no vicious pokes from Kirigiri. In turn, he later remembered he was supposed to read up on the chapters in his textbooks, something he hadn't done thanks to all the hours sleeping. With absolutely no clue what his teachers were asking of him during class, this led to a variety of awkward moments which he'd rather not go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirigiri...do you know what this means?\" He was already reluctant to ask, but it was either that or get a scolding for not doing work. It was worth trying even if he got everything wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should really keep up to speed with your homework Naegi.\" Kirigiri replied. \"Interesting you'd come to me about your notes instead of someone else. Since it's mathematics, shouldn't you be asking Fujisaki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah..well..you're just the closest to me is all!\" Naegi answered in a hurried manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Closest?\" This was accompanied by a old smile from Kirigiri, the kind that was uncommon for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I mean....you sit closest to me! You know, it's like that! I'll just look at your notes!\" He took a quick glance before turning his head back, cursing himself in his head for his rather embarrassing display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his head face down on the desk and the lecture in the background faded out in his ears, Naegi looked up dejectedly and glanced around the room. His eyes moved back and forth, but stopped as he saw a most peculiar sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes locked in on Celes. She was listening to the lesson, writing down notes with a pencil in one hand. However, in the other lay an object not often seen in the classroom, that being a fork. Inspecting the scene some more, Naegi say that before Celes laid a sizeable cake on a plate, lathered in cream and strawberries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating in class was actually permitted, since being Super Duper students they could have some leverage from certain rulings that normally wouldn't fly in a regular school. Some people used it at times, mostly in case they hadn't been able to eat a boxed lunch in time for lessons. Sakura sometimes enjoyed some coffee and occasionally you'd see Yamada munch at some snack, but this was something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the lesson, Naegi couldn't help but glance over to Celes every now and again, the cake slowly dissipating over time with each forkful. By the final bell, Celes had eaten the whole thing, placing her fork and cake away in a container and dabbing her mouth with a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi, come.\" Kirigiri shook the distracted male by the shoulder. \"It is lunch next, I should help you with your studies if you can't even get the simple stuff right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was simple?...\" He muttered as he joined Kirigiri, looking over to the notes on her books. So many numbers it made his mind boggle. Regardless, he joined Kirigiri for luncheon and a flurry of note revising.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Instead of heading over to the lunch room and having a nice meal that included lunch, Kirigiri had lead the almost clueless Naegi to the library to study. As with the classrooms, they also allowed food and drink in the room of study as long as no one abused that right too much. Kirigiri had the foresight to pack both of them simple sandwiches and other such snacks during the morning so the two wouldn't waste time going to the actual dining hall to eat. Picking a rather distant location in the library, Naegi struggled to keep his thoughts under lock and key. Of course, he would be the first to say that Kirigiri was quite 'attractive' and would be nice to do 'intimate acts' such as holding her hand or having lunch on the rooftop.  However, the ice cold detective was rather distant to most and he could never imagine a girl of her caliber being with a guy that had no decent qualities. Before his mind wandered to a dark place, Kirigiri called out to him, her violet eyes staring him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah sorry, I spaced out for a second there, what did you say?\" he asked, feeling embarrassed that the girl had caught him in such a state. She simply sighed as she presented a few problems for him to take on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, it's because you space out all the time that you have a hard time understanding these concepts. What do you think about constantly that's distracting me?\" said Kirigiri, now focusing her attention on the sandwich she was unwrapping. Before he could answer, he noticed Celes sitting at a far away table snacking on what seemed to be a few chocolate eclairs. Now this was strange for two reasons, first, Celes never went to the library, feeling no need to 'waste her time in books,' and the fact that the girl never was a fan of chocolate that wasn't the white variety. Quickly focusing his attention back on the paper in front of him, he would put these thoughts in the back of his head. As he began to work on Kirigiri's drills, the girl couldn't help but think of a simple thought as she continued her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe we can have a study session at one of our houses next time...' </span></div></div>",

Naegi felt something was amiss, that something odd was going on with Celes. What it exactly was, he had no clue, but he knew that the girl was acting in a very strange manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way up to the classroom, Naegi began to take a look at several shelves, all related to class work for all sixteen students. He thought towards what he noticed from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, she's eating more than usual....she attended the library....and she ate dark chocolate....\" Naegi pondered, wondering what kind of files would back him up. His first instinct was to take a look in Cele's literature writing book, the place where she would no doubt keep records of notes and work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the book, he flipped through the pages until the very end where he found a reading record. He remembered that these sheets were placed inside the books and would be used by someone to keep track of every book they'd read over the year, so it show what they'd have checked out so teachers could see if it was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Naegi had found a match to his suspicion. Cele's reading record only featured a mere two books, both ones which were mandatory reading material they'd read in class. The rest of the spaces for outside school reading where blank, accompanied by various notes from their literature teacher, all about how little she read and how she needed to see him after school due to a lack of reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there's one down. Maybe I can find a link to the chocolates now....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching through the shelf some more, Naegi had needed to delve into the archived section to find work from the previous year. However, it was worth it so to find something that would prove useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had found a selection of menus, used in a bakery day the school had hosted the previous year. Everyone from the class had been involved to make something, which brought back unpleasant memories for Naegi due to his disastrous attempts of cooking. Though, his attempts paled in comparison to Hagakure's cooking which led to him setting his hair on fire and breaking a highly expensive oven. Focusing back on topic, he found Cele's bakery menu for that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Celes had not actually partook in any cooking and merely purchased all the foods for that day, her choices and tastes were clearly visible. Every single item on her menu was a dessert dish of pre-made white chocolate delicacies. While there was the occasional dabble of different chocolate in them, white chocolate was still the main focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, that's two. Still doesn't explain why she's eating so much though. Maybe I should look around some more?\" Naegi thought, though his eyes cast over to the window where he saw the sun beginning to set along with a glance at his watch showing time moving on. He pondered for the moment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While students were given leeway to how long they could remain at school, snooping around the belongings of the other students could put him under the hot seat. As he walked through the hallways, his mind began to think over the two pieces of 'evidence' he had managed to gather. They were enough to put a bit of pressure on Celes for the truth, but it still lacked a certain pressure as Celes could simply brush them aside with lies or simple comments. Finally reaching the main doors of the school, the young teen froze in his tracks. A certain elegant black haired girl was standing right in front of him, her 'red' eyes piercing through his very body. A certain feeling told Naegi that he simply couldn't avoid this confrontation and he allowed her to come closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there Naegi, having fun after school are we?\" she said in her perpetual mocking tone. Naegi tried his best to stand steady and resist the heavy 'air' that she was giving off, but he still managed to flinch as she continued to stare him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I just forgot a few notebooks that I need for my studies, that's all.\" he said, trying to find the confidence in his voice once more. Not believing a single word, she gave him another glare, almost freezing him in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize that as a world class gambler I have one of the best eyes out there, nothing escapes my glance, not even someone as transparent as you are right now.\" Feeling himself on edge, he needed to push back or the entire 'investigation' would blow back in his face. Steeling himself, he began his counterpoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been having trouble sleeping lately, so I've been kinda forgetful too. As anyone and they would back that up, hell I can't count how many times I've nearly fallen asleep in class this week.\" Furrowing her brow, she came closer to him which made him feel pressure once more. \"No, it isn't that. While your eyes do look exhausted, which I notice from the beginning, there is something else. Could it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could it be what?\" He felt uneasy when he saw her lips curl into a smirk as she let out a rather obnoxious laugh. Bracing himself, his mind began to think of any potential excuses in case his sleuthing was discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've fallen for me have you? I've seen the way that you've been looking at me today, and I can tell when someone has become smitten with a lady of my caliber. It's happen so many times in the past that I've no clue how to deal with all of my potential suitors!\" Finding himself putting it all into not showing a 'strange' expression, it seemed that his best ploy would be to go along with this little fantasy of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Celes, don't you remember? I'm the 'un'luckster, how could a guy like me even think of going for a lady like you. I've only looked at you today because both times you were eating something sweet and I've been having a craving for the stuff all day, that's all.\" explained Naegi as he lied through his teeth. Letting out a more relaxed giggle, she came even closer to him, eliminating any semblance of personal space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Naegi, don't give excuses now as to why you are smitten with a world class lady. I can tell, you have a certain potential to you, something that will make you 'great' under the right amount of care and dedication.  You just need someone who could steer you into the right path, unlike that Kirigiri.\" feeling his eyes narrow at the mention of Kirigiri, Naegi felt his pulse quicken just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all see it, you constantly follow her around, you act as her servant and you rarely ever get the time to shine since you always play her support. It's like a blooming flower being robbed of its sunlight by a taller weed. She's squandering you in her very shadow.\"  Finding himself at an impasse, even he was starting to become confused? Squandered? Stolen potential? He'd never thought of such ideas before and as they were so foreign to him, he didn't have the capacity to reject such ridiculous claims. Still, Naegi had to continue to play along to avoid things becoming sour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, it's getting late. Why don't we talk about this a bit more at a cafe? My treat, after all, I treat those who favor my hand quite well.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naegi heard the offer and whilst his mind seemed to be against such a prospect, especially after the way she had referred to Kirigiri, Naegi simply couldn't muster the courage to even suggest not going with her. Cele's blood red eyes stared deep into his own trembling pair, the two rubies piercing past him looking right into his mind, allowing her to easily intimidate him. As to be expected from an expert gambler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Well...I guess...I could go with you...\" He weakly replied. He saw the tiny smile she bore crack open a little wider, her eyes narrowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. I shall lead the way for you.\" Naegi shivered as he felt her pale white hand grasp onto his own, taking it firmly. She was ice cold, as if blood had never flown through her veins. He'd always known Celes was fond of European trends, but feeling just how cold she was made Naegi start to question if she really was one of those undead who sucked on the blood of others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head and casting quite stupid thoughts aside, Naegi felt himself being pulled by Celes, only to have him jam right next to her side. He could feel on his hand just how soft the fabric was on her dress, giving the impression that it was made by only the best fabrics. Her arm slide around his own and intertwined, Celes and Naegi now locked arm to arm as she began to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This suits us better given your thoughts for me. A formal and polite way of letting those around us know of our relationship.\" He felt somewhat uneasy to see how far she was taking her assumption, which Celes easily picked up upon by looking over to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry, I'm merely giving you the basics on how to behave in a personal relationship between another lady. Stature must never be forgotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter not too long a distance of travelling with Celes by his side, she eventually escorted him to a place of her choosing. From first glance Naegi could see why Celes would have chosen such a place. The ornate wooden carvings around the entrance along with what seemed to be antique glass acting as a window certainly showed off the nature of the cafe. It was far from somewhere he would usually go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering in with his instincts telling him to let Celes in first so to please her, the inside was warm and welcoming. Wooden tables with a rich brown hue surrounded the area with several people seated at them all, many quite elderly and in smart dress. Naegi took a look down at his hoodie and wondered if it would have even made a difference to be smartly dressed due to his age and scruffy hair. Whilst he had been lamenting his dress style, Celes had approached one of the many servers inside and near instantly he was being ushered over to a table in the far corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing seated, having a menu given to him along with both napkins and cutlery all provided with the assistance of the staff with Celes getting the treatment too, Naegi took in the surroundings a little as he occasionally glanced over to Celes, who was instantly drifting her dangerously red eyes through a menu.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still feeling quite intimidated from the entire ordeal so far, Naegi kept quiet and attempted to steel his mind in order to ward off other 'attacks' from the clever girl. As Celes browsed the menu, he did the same, finding a number of quite fancy food items that were prices well beyond the amount of money he held in his wallet.  Even the cheapest of items would take a rather large chunk of his savings. Fretting over what he could actually order, Celes called over the waiter and gave him a list of a variety of sweets, including three strawberry shortcakes, a few eclairs, some tarts, a few parfaits a few chocolate cakes and a some dark chocolate truffles, something that caused Naegi's ears to perk up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, bring a bowl of New England clam chowder for my darling  and a glass of white wine for the table.\" ordered Celes as she slipped an undisclosed amount of money into the waiter's hand. Gladly accepting it, he left the two as he went to go report the lengthy order.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Celes are you sure that's fine? I mean we're both still minors and all.\" said the nervous Naegi as he began to feel self conscious for a different reason this time. Letting out her trademarked laugh, Celes waved about a few 5000 yen notes as a fan and as soon as she materialized them, they disappeared like magic. Impressed by the trick, Naegi had yet to realize just how much money the young gambler possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling, money is never an issue with my set of skills, so you'd never need to worry about such little details as 'laws' or 'crimes' and such. Of course, when you're potential is realized, I expect you to make as much money as I do on a daily basis but we'll discuss that issue when the time comes.\" explained Celes in her expected sultry tone. Finding himself becoming more and more engrossed by this new 'life' with Celes, he tried his best to keep his mind on the right path and figure out this 'case.'  In order for this, he had to arm himself with the pieces of 'ammo' he had managed to gather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Celes, before we start talking about this training, mind if I ask you a few questions that I noticed about you earlier?\" Finding his request a bit strange, she placed both hands on her pale face as she began to swoon over the fact that he 'noticed' the changes she had made that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To tell you the truth, I've had my eye on you as of late, it wasn't hard to notice you're shining potential from that dim Kirigiri.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided to take charge and make my self up a bit neater than usual, my drills were fluffier, my eyes were brighter and I even made sure to make my lips shine with this new lip gloss I was using.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you couldn't notice through all of that darkness, so I decided to scope you two out while <b>you were in the library.  It was quite easy to seem like I wasn't up to anything suspicious as I go there quite often.</b>  A gambler needs to seem as inconspicuous as possible after all.\" Finding his tell, Naegi used up his first bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say you went to the library to scope out me and Kirigiri, and that you go there often so we wouldn't think anything of it?\" Finding his response strange, she nodded in confirmation.  \"Well I think you're mistaken Celes, according to your reading journal, you haven't been at the library as many times as expected for a student at our school.\"  Taken aback, Celes kept her cool, after all, a gambler without a poker face is not a gambler at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Naegi, I suppose I couldn't hide that one from you. The truth was that I was interested in a certain book that they stocked in the school library and decided to read it while watching you two. I just didn't want you to think that I was up to something more sinister, that's all.\" Taking this piece of information in, it did sound reasonable so he decided to use his last bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were spying on us and reading a book, why were you eating as well? I kinda find it hard to believe that you could do all three things during the same time, even with those amazing red eyes of yours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well that is simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would alternate between eating the cake and reading the book and would take tabs on you two using my peripheral vision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it was a tad bit difficult to pull myself away from my <b>white chocolate cake</b> but I pulled through for my future spouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you proud of me? Oh I'm glad nothing happened between you two as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have wanted to discipline my darling on the very first day!\"  His eyes widening at her very wrong comment, Naegi pulled himself from 'firing the trigger.' While he did recall her eating the dark chocolate treat, he did not get a good look at the cake itself and he could have easily been mistaken. If only he had Celes impressive eyes or Kirigiri's natural intuition. Feeling himself losing grip on the situation, a faint recollection appeared in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She ordered the dark chocolate truffles.'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the gears in his brain whirring, Naegi thought carefully about his next move. He was fully aware that Celes would be a tough opponent in a war of words, but she was proving to be much more of a problem for him than expected. What little evidence and points Naegi had gathered didn't seem to add up to much and Celes seemed to have an answer for everything he'd thrown at her so far. Whilst his newest brainwave in relation to her order held some promise to his suspicions, at this point it was all a matter of finding the right time to strike with his comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi fell silent for the time being, patiently waiting as Celes in turn waited for the order to arrive. Only mere seconds into his wait did he end up locking eyes with Celes once more, those very same jewels focused on him with the same intimidation and fear invoked onto him as before. Whilst Naegi had come to somewhat be accustomed to the general aura that surrounded the upper class lady, he thought about just how frightening it must be for some hapless poker player meeting her for the first time, an event that had no doubt occurred several times in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you ever wonder about the circumstances that brought you to the academy?\" Celes questioned with her chin resting on her fingers, akin to a bridge with her hands. \"It goes beyond the common standard of remarkable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....to be honest it does cross my mind time and again.\" Naegi answered back, a little sluggishly due to being lost in his own train of thought. \"A normal kid like me being chosen at-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are far from normal.\" Celes interrupted with swiftness. \"The very moment you are selected to join Kibogamine Academy you are no longer grouped within normality. You have a title in relation to your skills and accomplishments just like all of us, another sign of your rejection from being 'Normal' \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My title? That's nothing to be proud of, I'm just the Luckster-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incorrect again.\" A notable edge could be heard in Celes' voice. \"Luckster is just as important a title as my own High Roller title.\" Her voice reduced back to it's normal intonation and a small smile grew on her pale face. The red eyes darted to the left as she spied the orders she'd made all ready to be served. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning herself upwards to which Naegi stopped slouching in response, several staff members surrounded the table as they begun to place all the dishes in various corresponding areas. The single bowl of Chowder was placed close to Naegi, allowing him to gain some insight into it's smell. As expected, it was fresh and rich, making him very curious to see how the taste would hold up in comparison. Celes' dishes were all scattered amongst the table, the larger cakes taking centre stage in front of the refined girl whilst the truffles, tarts and shortcakes were littered around the largest plates, making it look akin to the pollen centre of a flower with it's petals by the sides. Lastly, the bottle of white wine was provided in a chilled bucket filled with ice, with two glasses pre-emptively filled with the beverage for both Celes and Naegi. He himself hesitated to touch the stuff due to their ages, but Celes was more than happy to take her first sips before acquiring a fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying, you have an important title Naegi. Any poker player regardless of skill will tell you luck is one of the greatest factors of the game. The cards do not decide where they appear in the deck, they do not decide whose hand they end up in. Luck determines their position in the game. You ciould say it's like fate...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles took her first mouthfuls of the grand chocolate cakes, somehow able to gather large helpings of them onto her fork yet still remain elegant as she ate them. \"It's the same with you Naegi. Your luck is intertwined with fate. Out of every single student in the country, every boy and girl in education entered in the raffle, you were the one. You were the very person chosen for such an illustrious and life changing placement. With an event such as that, you can hardly say that your title as Luckster is nothing important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can understand why you're saying that now.\" Naegi replied, having taken a break from eating his Chowder whilst listening. He was very pleased with the taste and could see why Celes would offer such a dish for him. A part inside of him felt warm due to the act of kindness shown, but his mind quickly set back to looking for the right time to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally.\" Celes replied. \"Your luck has been dictated by fate, which in turn has led to such an event as this. You see, it's a matter of destiny. You and I have been thrust together through the acts of fate, written in the grand scheme to be one of the many outcomes in your life. All because of your luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this seems sounds very superstitious. Didn't really take you for that kind of person Celes.\" The idea of superstition brought Naegi back to the very obvious vampire imagery in her mannerism and dress. Made his mind cast to whether she took an interest in such a thing, but knowing his plan of action he pushed the thoughts back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a lot you can learn from a person when you just spend the time with them. As our relationship blossoms I'm sure we'll learn plenty more about each other.\" A smile rose onto her face once more, this one seemingly more different than the previous ones. Not knowing why, but Naegi felt it to make him rather uncomfortable.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>His bullet still in his chamber, the timing to make the shot had yet to make its appearance. Seeing her smile, at first it made him uncomfortable due to how it was a reminder of all the times he had witnessed her usual 'grin' at Hope Academy.  It mostly showed itself when she had just laid down a verbal breakdown on those who just happened to cross her in the wrong way, whenever she manipulated others into getting her own way or when she was in her own dark and dank thoughts. This smile was different however, Naegi could tell, for once, Celes was being sincere. This put him on edge once more, trying to find a sign that she was actually planning something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Celes, but what exactly do you mean by relationship?: he asked, still confused on the issue. Her smile still set in place, she let out a rather soft giggle, something that the Luckster was also highly unfamiliar with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Naegi, it's rather easy to grasp. I'm giving you the opportunity to court me of course!\"  Nearing choking on his clam chowder as he tried to get in a few mouthfuls before her explanation, Naegi's mind was thrown into a whirl. Naegi had never been popular girls his age and it wasn't until Kirigiri came around that he cared about dating and such, But here was Celes, a girl he could never get a handle on due to her own mysterious and dark demeanor, allowing him to actually 'date' her, a chance any guy his age would kill him for. As he thought over this, his mind went back to the gambler's words earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My potential.' he thought, the words still ringing in his mind. The concept itself was incredibly foreign for the teen. All throughout his life, he had never been anything other than average, he never stood out and there was simply nothing of worth he could ever say about himself. The thought of someone painting himself as something more was enticing indeed. Before he was going to be swept up in a flood of confusion, he imagined Kirigiri and thought of what she would do in such a situation. 'Get the upper hand.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does that mean exactly, would we go on dates? Would we spend time together?\" Taking in a modest bite out of an eclair, she daintily wiped her mouth with her handkerchief and stared at him with her deep red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be rigorous indeed. I will show you how to be the perfect gentlemen in order to support me in the future. I will also teach you the details of the physical aspect of our relationship as well as showing you the true world that I exist it.\" His thoughts nearly going to a rather surly place at the words 'physical,' Naegi was able to hatch up a bit of a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to get it and it's actually starting to sound pretty nice. To be with you that is. Though I think we should get to know more about each other before anything starts up right?\" At this point, Naegi tried to form a sincere smile as his lips curled slightly upward. As he was never charismatic in the slightest, he felt that coming off as awkward also fit well for him. To Celes, she had felt a small ping in her heart and felt her chest tighten a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, that is a wise idea Naegi, you should get to know me very quickly, that's an order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's start with your likes and dislikes then. I seem to recall from school that white chocolate is your favorite correct?\" he asked, recalling the events of last year's cooking lessons. Celes nodded, happy that the Luckster knew a bit about her already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, would you say something like this satisfies your taste for white chocolate?\" said Naegi as he pointed towards the uneaten dark chocolate truffles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I love white chocolate truffles. Oh my, where are my manners, Naegi would you like to try one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Gotcha!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Enthusiastic about his chance to shine, he slammed his hand on the table as he shouted out, causing a few heads to turn and confusing Celes, still idly chewing at her current mouthful before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi dear, what exactly do you mean by \"Gotcha?\" She asked, taking a sip of wine. \"Don't you mean 'Got you?' \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...ah...well...\" Naegi slowly slunk back into his chair. His momentum had been slowed down by his somewhat enthusiastic display, but his evidence stayed fresh in his mind, still intending to go through with his accusation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Celes, you just said there you enjoy white chocolate, don't you?\" His eyes drifted about the room. Much to his relief, no one was staring at him any longer after having made a bit of a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles seemed confused. \"Why yes I did. Is there something the matter? Do you prefer dark chocolate Naegi?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is something the matter about that. Plus I prefer my chocolates in all varieties.\" Naegi briefly wondered why he responded to the second question, but he kept focused on the matter at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Celes, every time I have seen you eating chocolate, it hasn't been white at all. It has always been dark chocolate. In class, in the library, even right now. It's always dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles may have been a skilled poker player with a near unreadable poker face, but a brief pause in her movements the moment Naegi finished his sentence allowed him to deduct that he had struck a note with her in his evidence. Moments later, Celes gave out a slight giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you are right. It appears I am mistaken, though I am not sure why. This is truly dark chocolate unlike my preferred white chocolate. Rather odd, wouldn't you agree Naegi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is really strange...\" He agreed with a finger on his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do tell me....why do you think such a thing could happen? How could have I mistaken dark chocolate for white chocolate?\" Celes finished the final chocolate truffle, popping a whole one into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi knew he couldn't keep Celes waiting. Thinking about her question, he spoke up to give an answer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The answer had to be something that was obvious even to him. Its not that people are just able to confuse two completely different things without an outside influence being brought into play. With this line of thinking, the luckster began to think of anything that could potentially confuse Celes because it was 'distracting' her keen eyes and senses.  While he wasn't as bright as Kirigiri, even he could come to a logical conclusion if he was put under the spotlight. Recalling everything so far, there was one thing present every time the enigmatic dark haired girl was eating the dark chocolate.  It was himself. While he didn't want to think of himself as being conceited, it was the only answer he could actually come up with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I figured out the answer.\" he said with very little emotion behind his tone. Celes stared at him, almost expecting him to shout out at her once more. At the moment, Naegi was feeling quite downtrodden. All he had managed to do is logic his way into a circle and let the gambler keep two steps ahead of him the entire time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you know, do you mind telling me then?\" she asked, placing the last dark chocolate truffle dainty inside her mouth. Naegi expected her to have a rather sinister smirk on her face right now, but she was calm and he could a faint red hue on her pristine face. \"It was me wasn't it?\" he asked, feeling a bit strange in watching her face continue to grow red in color as she looked away from him.  Quickly eating up a piece of strawberry cheesecake, Naegi felt his chest tighten a bit at the cute action, something he thought he would never say about the intimidating Celes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, everything I've said this day was the golden truth. I've got nothing to gain to lie to you, in fact it's in my best interest to be completely honest with you. And trust me, that is something I do very rarely.\" Feeling himself cornered and out of any ammo, Naegi thought the best course of action was to let the girl take the 'lead' once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I believe you Celes.\" said Naegi, letting the issue die down for now.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nAfter finishing up her extravagant meal, a rather stuffed Celes and Naegi made their way outside, the gambler taking care of the check as stated. As of now, the sun was setting, placing an orange backdrop on the air itself. They were walking down the street, rather close to one another. His arm was wrapped around her waist, his fingers barely touching the surface of her rigid middle. Unlike his previous hold on her, she was feeling quite warmer and there was a certain 'sweet' smell to her. Could eating that much desert have that much effect on a girl. Contouring her 'drill' like ponytails, she laid her head on his shoulder, letting out a rather awkward giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Naegi,how did you like the taste of fine dining? Trust me, its just the beginning for us.\" she said, tightening the hold she had on his waist. They still young so affectionate displays were still considered fine in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well that's good to know.\" said Naegi, still continuing to keep himself quiet for the sake of observing her actions. There still had to be something else that was driving her actions and he was going to stick with her until he found the answer. Eventually the two found themselves at a crossroads where they would separate to go to their homes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi, there is one more thing we should discuss. I know that your relationship with that Kirigiri is still important to you, so I propose we keep our relationship secret at school so that would not be affected. Know this darling, this isn't because I want to hide our affections, that is far from the truth. I would gladly tell anyone that you are important to me, I simply care about you and know that the detective holds a special friendship with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand Celes.\" said Naegi, glad that he would be able to maneuver freely at school without the risk of Celes' attention. Taking both of his hands and holding them tightly, she stared at him with her deep red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However Naegi, should you go behind my back with Kirigiri or any other girl undeserving of you, I'll be right there to sever any unimportant limbs, all five of them in fact.\" A terrible shiver going down his spine, Naegi nodded, trying his best to not show fear on his face. \"Now there is one more thing before we part for the day.\" said Celes as she slowly closed her eyes and brought herself even closer to the young teen. As if time had stopped, Naegi's mind froze, unable to come up with a clear solution. </span></div></div>",

Naegi scrambled to think about the situation in his mind, reaching desperately at the thoughts that were whizzing about inside his head at a million miles a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I really kiss her in public? What if someone sees us? What if Kirigiri saw us....\" Naegi clung onto trains of thought and processed them quickly, attempting to come to a decision. \"If I do, what if I mess up? Surely there's some kind of refined way of kissing that rich people use! If I do it wrong she'll be less than pleased! Should I make an excuse? Go with the flow? Just run aw-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything in Naegi's mind came to a crashing halt when Celes' lips made contact with his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the arms of the gambler wrap around his waist, hands on his hips. He heard the slightest moans as she prolonged the kiss, still pressing into his lips. His mind felt cleared, no more racing thoughts as all that mattered to Naegi now was kissing Celes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't care less for whether he was in public or not, the feeling was just so pleasant. Warmth radiated from Celes, the filling meal seemingly heating her up compared to how icy cold she was before she ate. Her lips were soft on his own, her touch gentle yet firm around his waist. Seeing no problem now his mind was clear, Naegi rose his hands and grabbed the back of Celes' head, his fingers enveloped in silk black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sunset began to give it's final bows as it fell behind the backdrop of the sky, leaving the final rays of sunshine to drift on the young couple as they embraced in a long kiss, both of them enjoying themselves as they shared the moment together. When the area was fully enveloped in the mild twilight sky, Celes finally pulled back from Naegi's lips, her hands clasped onto his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kissing is an art form dear, what you did was highly impressive for your first time.\" Celes noted, placing her fingertips on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First time? What makes you think that was my first kiss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush now.\" Celes gave a dismissive wave with her left hand. \"This is your first proper kiss as a man. Kissing some girl because you shared juice with her back when you were seven is a far different circumstance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way...It was a very nice kiss.\" Naegi couldn't help but lick his lips, tasting residue chocolate from Celes' meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course. I enjoyed myself to a grand extent. We must go out on another date very soon.\" A rare case of Celes giving a warm, genuine smile occurred, no sense of impending doom or intimidation for once. She lined up next to Naegi and linked arms once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, will you be so kind to escort a lady to her home?\" She rested her head onto his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Celes.\" Naegi merely responded, feeling oddly peaceful as the two walked down the streets.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't that long of a walk as Celes lived close to where the eatery was. Still holding onto his arm, Naegi went over the events of the day. First Celes had approached him after doing a bit of snooping on her, next she invites him to a fine and fancy eatery and finally she kissed him in a very intimate way. All of this way enough to leave anyone starstruck but as Naegi was a competent man, his best choice was to simply go along with Celes' 'flow' and strike back when the opportunity presents itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi?\" Bringing himself out of his thoughts, he looked at Celes who seemed to be trying to get his attention for the past few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I'm sorry. Is something wrong?\" he asked, feeling her eyes pierce him once more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my Naegi, whenever you're with a woman, you need to make sure to never daze off and potentially ignore her wants.\" said the gambler in her usual haughty tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll remember that for next time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. The reason I was calling out for you was to know if you'd be open tomorrow after school. We have no major exams coming up and it would be a good opportunity to continue your training in the arts of being a gentleman.\" Thinking it over, Naegi really didn't have anything pressing. He did have some tutoring with Kirigiri but that was at lunchtime so it wouldn't interfere. Looking back over to her, he gave her a warm smile, something that Celes didn't expect and something that caused her walls to come down for a short moment. Turning her head so Naegi wouldn't see the red glow on her face, she tightened her hold over him, bringing him even closer to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have anything so I'll meet you after school. Is that alright with you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, of course that is fine with me, It would be unwise to stand me up so remember to keep your word.\" Eventually the pair would reach her house, which ended up being the penthouse to a fancy apartment building. Even if Naegi would have managed to save up a lifetime's worth of savings, he doubt he would ever be able to afford such an affluent location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behold Naegi, this is one of the many prime and pristine locations that the elite choose to house themselves. Trust me, soon enough and I'll show you the wonders of this type of world.\" giggled Celes as she released Naegi's arm and walked in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Celes, thanks for everything today. I'll see you in class tomorrow.\" said Naegi as he began to walk towards the direction of the train station. With a firm grip, Celes stopped Naegi by his shoulder. Looking back, he could clearly see that she had an annoyed expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that I didn't teach you enough today. Is that the proper way to send off a lady?\" she asked, her red eyes looking right at him. She slowly walked up to Naegi, the expectant expression on her face once more. Not wanting to upset her any further, he came closer as well, placing his arms around her and resting them on the small of her back and gently dipped his head down so his face was just inches away from her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this right?\" he whispered as he gently kissed her lips, once again tasting the sweet chocolate she had eaten earlier. Pulling away, he saw the grin on her face as she went in for a second time, capturing his lips for the second time that night. A few more minutes of indulging in the young man, she slowly released her hold on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night my dear Naegi.\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train ride home was rather uneventful compared to his time with Celes. Walking the street-lit path home, he reminded himself to not get too caught up in Celes, that he was simply going along to make sure his hunches were right and to prove that he could be his own person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, own person? Since when do I think like that?' he thought to himself as he tried to get rid of the strange thought. He couldn't let the black haired girl get the best of him, he needed to stay a few steps ahead of her. Soon enough he reached his home which was a simple two story house. The earlier glimpse of Celes' home made him rethink just how 'middle class' he was. Entering, he was greeted by both his mother and father who were in the living room, doing their nightly readings and television watching. He gave them his usual greetings and told him he had met up with friends after school and had eaten dinner with them. Pleased to see that their Naegi was being sociable for once, they believed the excuse and Naegi went up to his room, to relax after the rather stressful day. Plopping himself onto his bed, he placed a finger onto his lips, remembering just how soft she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Still, kissing is really nice.' he thought as he pulled out his phone to check emails and any texts. It seems that in the period of walking home from the train station, he had gotten two messages. One from Celes and one from Kirigiri.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naegi did give the proposal some thought. His initial mind-set was going against the offer, seeing that he'd rather stay away from the person he was investigating, especially if it was a cunning mind such as Celes who would easily be able to look through him. However, it didn't stop the possibility of actually going through with it. Naegi was genuinely curious on if Celes was being just a serious as she sounded, if she truly did have some feeling for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch thoughts were soon drowned out when the amateur detective cast his mind over to Kirigiri. There was no way she'd show him any mercy if he hung about with someone like Celes. Most other girls in his class would be fine (Though Kirigiri was never fond of Maizono), but Celes had always rubbed her the wrong way. He'd prefer not to risk easily his strongest friendship over some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Celes, but I'll have to decline your generous offer.\" He replied to her, trying to sound as confident and genuine as possible. Much to his surprise, he pulled it off well despite knowing his was turning down the girl with blood diamonds for eyes. \"I'm far to occupied with other matters to spend time with you sadly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the reaction came. Another surprise came when Celes merely smiled. Not a single dent in her expression was present, leading into her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I completely understand Naegi. There are so many demanding aspects of life for a strapping figure such as yourself. I shall leave you in peace, best of luck to your endeavours, I hope our paths cross beyond school hours once more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Celes merely walked away. Watching her walk away confidently, Naegi felt a sigh of relief come from his mouth. Not sure why he exactly did so, given how well he handled the situation, he at least felt glad the event wasn't a farce. Besides, he actually had something important to do. With new evidence in his mind that would no doubt help him, he needed to actually look over it to see if it made sense and was watertight. Naegi simply walked over to the main entrance of the school and began his journey home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile though, Celes was making her own way home. Her mind was still firmly set on Naegi, fully respecting his reason for not being able to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi is still a normal student even if he is a Super Duper. His demanding normal life does require commitment. Perhaps if this continues I can pull some strings to help him out...\" Celes thought to herself as she walked through the dimming city streets, making her way to her domain on the other side of the hustle and bustle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure there'll be some of my butlers who'll be willing to-OUCH!\" As she rounded a street corner, Celes found herself bumping right into a person who happened to be turning the corner too. Both people bashed heads, causing pain for the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSending the gambler a few steps back, she rubbed her head with an angry look on her pale face, a tad red from the bump. However, her anger soon dissolved when she saw who she'd knocked into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, if it isn't Miss Kirigiri?\" Celes greeted with a warm smile, though she was still annoyed by the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, hello Celes. Where are you going to this late?\" Kirigiri asked as she looked up the darkening sky, the orange sunset slowly being replaced by a darkened purple hue. \"Do you have another poker game to attend to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I'm just going home. I was completing some outstanding tasks at the school.\" Celes answered with a smile. \"Where are you going yourself Kirigiri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm simply heading over to one of the stores nearby, I have some things to buy.\" Kirigiri's responses were rather simple and mostly deadpan, much to the chagrin of Celes. They both knew they were very rarely on the same page, even more so in relation to the developments with Naegi for Celes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, allow me to join you. I'll gladly help.\" On a spur of the moment idea, Celes felt it necessary to spend some time with Kirigiri. If she could steer the conversation about Naegi, Celes felt she could find out some interesting titbits about the young man. If she could gain some knowledge like that, it might give her an edge in the bid to woo Naegi and hinder her most prominent rival!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist now Celes. I'm only going to a normal store, so you won't find anything jewel encrusted there.\" The black haired beauty gave a brief scowl, but stayed by Kirigiri as she joined her in walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a bother. We all need those little necessities every now and again.\" In came her first attempt to steer the talk. \"Has Naegi ever joined you in such events?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No he has not. I can do my shopping on my own, it's only basic stuff.\" Kirigiri shot down Celes' attempt easily, making a turn into a back-alley way, no doubt to use as a short cut, something Celes did often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you should take this route?\" Celes noted. Now she felt like having a little fun. \"It's not the place for girls like us to be, especially when it's late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike you, I don't give people motives to attack me in dark alleys.\" Despite her heated talk, Kirigiri still didn't emote. \"I'll be fine, you should worry about yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings began to heat up. \"I'll have you know, I can handle myself just fine. If anything, you're giving all those lawbreakers reason to go after you when you have them arrested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I do is for justice. What you do is for greed. My motivations heavily outweigh yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. You have no pride about you, you wouldn't understand my reasons for gambling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, such heated arguments and venomous discussion had garnered some unwanted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the midst of all the arguing, Kirigiri suddenly held a hand up. \"Ssh. Someone is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the alley?\" Celes merely look confused, the shadows growing about her in the darkening world. \"I don't know what you me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sharp thud, the wealthy girl was struck and she fell with a hard knock. Kirigiri knew she couldn't just stand there, causing her to merely make a run for the end of the alley with no regard for Celes. With the figure looming over her unconscious body, it was too risky to do something to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Kirigiri could make it out of the alley and into the dim city streets, another figure came from behind the wall faster than she anticipated. Giving the intelligent sleuth several sharp punches and kicks to her face and body, she felt herself being thrown to the ground, head smacking off the concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Kirigiri lost conciousness, she saw a face that looked familiar to her. Though distorted through her fading vision, she could tell it was without a doubt someone she knew. It didn't matter in the end, as the world around her soon faded to black as she passed out, her knowledge of the person rendered useless.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night had passed rather uneventful for the seemingly average teen. He did his homework, he texted Kirigiri as usual and actually went to bed at a reasonable time. Waking up at an also reasonable time, it didn't take him long to ready himself for school and he left with enough time to enjoy the morning walk. Checking his phone, he saw that he had a few more texts from the purple haired detective but chalked it up as nothing unusual. Around twenty minutes of walking, he had arrived to the gates of the school and saw something that would cause his heart to jump into his throat. Kirigiri was standing by the gate, looking down at her phone and was most likely awaiting Naegi. Now this would usually cause the teen to get a bit happy since it gave him a bit more time to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good morning Naegi.\" said Kirigiri as she slowly walked up to Naegi, a warm smile on her face.  Now Naegi considered himself to be a rather rational person, never rushing to conclusions or taking unwise actions on a whim. He pinched his cheeks because the sight in front of him must have been a product of a strange dream. Though no matter how hard he pinched, he did not awake, for what was in front of him was reality. The Kirigiri standing in front of him was incredibly large, plush ,plump, overweight. No matter what adjective you used, they would all lead back to one word. Kirigiri was fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi, is there something wrong?\" she asked, placing a plump hand on his forehead. As Kirigiri was standing right in front of him, he got a rather good look at her current figure. Even now, she sported her usual wear of a purple jacket, white blouse and a medium length black skirt. The only difference was the fact that all of the articles of clothing were stretched greatly in order to cover her flabby mass. First was Kirigiri's midsection, a large rounded gut pushed its way from her midsection and hanged well bellow her waistline. Separated into two rolls, her blouse was having troubles covering such a belly and the buttons were greatly strained. Going down further were her thick and succulent thighs which constantly rubbed against one another and her hips flared out from her body, which would cause her to brush against things constantly. Her flabby and immense rear was covered by her stretched out black skirt and if one paid close attention, they would be able to see the faint outline of her twice extra large purple panties. There was one difference with the girl, instead of the normal black fashionable boots she usually wore, there was black tennis shoes that adorned her cute tubby feet. Kirigiri's blouse was also strained by her heaving breasts, each orb of fat and softness rested quite nicely on the top her her bulging belly. Chubby hands lead to thick forearms which lead to marshmallow like upper arms. Kirigiri's normally steely face was tarnished by a layer of softness, complete with a prominent double chin and chipmunk like cheeks. Naegi held in his composure since he didn't want to make a scene right in front of the gates. Gently taking her soft hand off of his forehead, his mind was racing to find out just what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, no I'm fine. Thanks for asking.\" Nodding, causing her check and neck fat to momentarily touch the other, this Kirigiri held a satisfied look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good then, I can't have you being sick diminish your progress in math. I trust you have no issue with me teaching you a bit more during lunch correct?\" she asked in her normal tone. Right off of the bat, Naegi could tell something was off, even if the Kirigiri standing in front of him was as thin as her usual self. Ignoring his instincts crying out to him to run away from this flabby girl, he decided to 'play along' to gather information, something which Kirigiri had taught him long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you need me for something else? You usually don't wait up for me by the gate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much, I just felt like talking to you, that's all. So should we head to class now?\" With a nod, Naegi began to follow Kirigiri as she made her way past the gates. There were two things the Naegi felt during this walk, the first being the overwhelming 'pressure' he felt from the detective and the second was a bit of anger rising up from within.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By all manners and stretches of the imagination, Naegi could easily say that it had been one of the oddest days of his entire life, the major revelation that had occurred today being far too strange for him to even begin to think of an explanation. After all, his day had started off with his closest friend suddenly being 200 pounds heavier over the course of a single day. It was hard to top anything as surreal as that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite all this, Naegi continued on through the day along with Kirigiri by his side. Lessons drifted by as usual, the occasional tidbit catching Naegi's eye. He noticed that no one in the class seemingly cared that the Super Duper Sleuth was morbidly obese, everyone going by their usual routine regardless. On a side note, Naegi also took note of how Kirigiri was acting a little, as he put it, \"touchier\" than normal. She'd near always want to help him with school work, getting close to him when she wanted to. Belly nearly always squashed into the table, her hefty breasts would press into his shoulders and her plump hands would clasp over his own as he wrote, Kirigiri taking it on herself to write solutions on his behalf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this all came to a halt when the bell rang. The lunch bell to be precise. As it rang, Kirigiri's head turned over to the direction of the doorway. Without even waiting for Naegi to collect himself, she grabbed his wrist with a thick hand and near dragged him to his feet. With long strides of her plump thighs, brushing against both objects and people as she walked, Kirigiri was dead set on making it to the cafeteria as fast as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you slow down just a little? Your grip is starting to hurt too...\" Naegi mumbled as he continued to be dragged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come Naegi, you know I enjoy being early in line for lunch.\" Kirigiri replied, not even looking back. \"If I'm not there early enough, all the good selections will be gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do?\" He questioned as Kirigiri near barged past the cafeteria doors, spying the line and entering quickly before anyone else could join the queue. She moved Naegi over in front of herself, leaving him wondering why she would do that after showing her hurry to get into line. It didn't take long before he found out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt soft flesh near envelop him in line. His hands had a cushion-like feeling surround them, incredibly soft to the touch. Curious, he squeezed slightly and much to his surprise he found himself grabbing two entire handfuls of the stuff, his fingers sinking into them. This was soon followed by another addition, finding two arms wrapping around him, going around his waist and meeting in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirigiri?\" Naegi asked. \"What exactly are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? We always do this.\" There was some genuine puzzlement in her voice, followed by her holding onto him a little tighter so he sunk into her fleshy belly even more. \"We're at a point in our relationship where this is okay with both of us. Besides, you like the softness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi really had no idea what she was going on about. He knew easily that something was fishy about Kirigiri right now, but why exactly she was like this had been not going too well. So far his only explanation is that his Kirigiri had fallen into an alternate universe and been replaced by the Kirigiri from said alternate universe where she has always been this fat. It was an absurd idea, but it was a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was soon broken from his admittedly stupid train of thought as Kirigiri let her grasp go over him, near pushing him out of the way. When he turned his head, he saw why. She had finally reached the coveted serving area, the entire place littered with all kinds of foods to satisfy anyone. Kirigiri wasted no time grabbed serving spoons and using them to get grand portions of food to spill over her plate. Naegi looked over and noticed there was very little rhyme or reason to her serving, Kirigiri merely dolloping portions onto her plate and over each other with no care for consistency. Everything was piled up over and over until her plate looked like a mountain of edible foodstuffs that just barely stayed on her plate, Naegi looking over and thinking about how he'd barely be able to finish a quarter of the selection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be faster Naegi. I don't like to be left waiting when I have my food.\" He was told by his rather blubbery friend, an almost serious look on her face. Obeying, he took a few servings onto a plate and finished up, following Kirigiri over to a table. Sitting down first, he saw her sitting down right beside him. Just like before, her belly was squashed up against the table they sat at, only this time she was closer than ever. One of her thickened thighs brushed against his own, along with Naegi getting a clear view of some exposed skin, thanks to Kirigiri's blouse having difficulty concealing her body due to the strained buttons holding the blouse together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he began to eat his own meal, he saw Kirigiri not say a word to him, simply staring at her massive portion before her with intent.</span></div></div>",

He barely touched his as he simply watched her consume bite after bite. Frankly, it was slightly memorizing seeing a girl of her enormity eat just so much food. Taking a break from the meal, she placed a plump hand on her satisfied and quite greedy middle and let out a small and cute burp. It is here where she noticed that Naegi barely touched his meal, comprised of a simple burger and a few fries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi, is something wrong?\" she asked, her stoic face not showing an ounce of sympathy, something else that he was quite used to by now. Looking at her incredibly rounded and chubby face, Naegi did notice one important detail. Taking that bit of detail aside, he tried to come up with an excuse to why he was staring at the flabby 'detective.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah no it's fine, I was just...\" before the sentence could be finished, Kirigiri had interrupted him by placing a plump hand on his forehead. To Naegi, it felt incredibly warm which caused his own face to warm up as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, it doesn't seem that you have a fever or anything.\" she said as she pulled back her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well I'm not sick or...\" he tried to explain once more and again he was interrupted by Kirigiri placing a single finger on his lips.  This time sporting a smile of sorts, she wrapped her flabby arms around the so called 'luckster' and brought him in close for a hug, pressing his slim frame against her massive gut and inadvertently shoving his face in her incredibly soft breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi, you don't have to be so courteous around me. I've known you for so long now that I can tell when you just want attention.\" she said as she nuzzled her head over the top of Naegi's in a comforting fashion. A combination of lack of airflow due to being held against her breasts and the incredible warmth of the embrace, Naegi's mind went into a freeze of sorts as the pure pleasure overtook his sense. After about a minute or two, she released her hold, giving him another soft smile. His mind returning to normal functions, Naegi had caught on to how this Kirigiri was treating him. 'Attention,' that was the one work which lit up a light in his mind, telling him that yet again, something was incredibly off. This Kirigiri was treating him like a 'freshman.' While the Kirigiri he knew would almost always take the lead in many things, she never 'coddled' him like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that I don't need to be courteous around you right?\" he asked, a clear idea now forming in his mind. Kirigiri nodded, causing her neck flab to overlap with the softness surrounding her cheeks and chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Naegi, it was part of our relationship.\" With those words acting as a 'go-ahead' he decided to start off nice and slow by placing his right hand on top of her meaty left thigh. Feeling the softness dance under his fingertips and grabbed and rubbed it, his hand moving up and down the surface. Kirigiri held a neutral look, which signaled to Naegi that he needed to step things up a bit. Twisting his body a bit, he moved his right hand to her prominent love hand and placed his left hand on her thigh, this time going closer and touching the inside of her plump thigh. With the left hand, he gently tickled her and with his right, he groped and prodded her midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like this is fine right?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With both hands sunk into copious amounts of flesh, Naegi's eyes remained focused on the soft plushy face of the girl before him. With a hand on her meaty thighs and another on the expanse of her gut, much to his chagrin her face did not change one bit. Her neutral expression stayed no matter how much he stroked or felt the soft squishy flesh that enveloped her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's all very fine.\" She responded, placing a hand atop Naegi's head so to ruffle his hair. \"It's all very cute you'd do that for my sake.\" Another smile appeared on her face. Her plump hands moved to his face, squeezing his cheeks together. Her skin felt like the smoothest silk, each digit of fat heavenly to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she just call me cute?\" Naegi knew that his current actions weren't going to cut it. He needed to take some drastic measures if he wanted to crack this egg. This obese, coddling, beautiful egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi prepared his A-game. \"Oh, I think I can be even more than fine. Wouldn't you like to see Kirigiri?\" Shifting his hands, he move closer to her so to get a better handle over her expanse, his slim body squishing into her huge gut with his face closer than ever to her own, being able to smell her sweet breath. His hands slide around her entire body, finding a sweet spot to take advantage of. That's when he found it, the single softest area on the titanic girl's body, so much so it put her hefty breasts to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi firmly grasped Kirigiri's ass, his hand near lost in a sea of immense flab. His fingers were caked in a huge lathering of sheer fat that had built up on her rear, leading him to wonder just how big her cheeks were. He reeled his hand back, freeing his hand from the gluttony induced behind only to send it crashing back down, a sharp slap heard as his hand was smothered once again. Naegi thought about any lucky bystander who could catch a glimpse of the ripples of rolling fat that slap would have caused, but his mind quickly drifted to groping copious amounts of massive asscheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you want to get more comfortable?\" With that, Naegi stepped back and sat himself onto the seating arrangements, his vision looking up to Kirigiri blocked partially by her huge chest. Using his non-ass groping hand, he twisted her body around and promptly pulled her down so that she could sit onto his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SWEET JESUS\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind mentally screamed as the 115 pound boy found his legs being crushed into dust by a 321 pound girl. With his hand still firmly planted and subesquently sandwiched between her ass and his legs, Naegi kept a brave face on as he allowed the heavy-set Kirigiri to sit on his knee, her thick thighs oozing all about and her hefty belly jiggling with gusto as he tried to find a sweet spot for her to sit. Much to his relief, he found a seating posistion to suit both her comfort and his body, his legs no longer hurting from her impressive weight. His hand continued it's mission to squeen the ample fatty cheeks whilst his hand currently rested atop her belly holding her in place as she sat atop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Naegi took for his final procedure. Leaning his body upwards so to reach her gloriously fat face, he tilted her head down slightly so to reach fully. Taking his hand to her breasts so to make this easier, Naegi now found himself directly at the side of her face, pressing his own into her cheek. With her ear right before him, Naegi took the advantage to cheekily nibble on her ear, his teeth locked around the top so he could tug a little. He felt a little childish doing this, but he simply couldn't resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing his improvised ear play, he finally got around to doing what he wanted. Getting as close as he could to her ear, hand still enjoying her smooth rear and his other hand currently nestled between her breasts, he began to whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about something like this Kyouko-chan?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The amount of shear warmth and pleasure that Naegi had felt was immense indeed. His hand resting right on her rear, he began to motion it in circles around the plump surface, the silky like surface tickling the ends of his hands and his inner core. Just the thought that only a few centimeters of fabric separated his hand from the bare sight that was her panty covered rear made his mind go into a haze of sorts. Was she wearing incredibly stretched out underwear? Was sort of color was it? What type was it? All sorts of questions were swirling inside of his eager mind, driving him to continue on with his pursue of the hefty girl. His triple front attack continued, biting her ear a bit hard, massaging her breasts with his one hand and rubbing and slapping her rear with the other. At this point, Naegi's entire face was flushed, sweat starting to bead down his face due to the combination of the immense pressure he felt on his lower half and the pure stimulation he was currently undergoing. Beginning to slowly lose his own inhibitions, he no longer cared about showing her up or winning this little match of theirs, he only wanted more and more pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uh, u-uh, t-this might be too much...\" squeaked out Kirigiri as she tried to hold back the urge to stand up and retreat from their current situation. However, retreating from this situation meant that she was going to let Naegi take the lead and potentially lead to her own downfall. He noticed that her face was glowing red and her breathing was labored.  For the sake of her 'pride' she needed to come out on top.  The only issue with that was that Naegi was still on the attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You mean stop this?\" asked Naegi, briefly releasing his teeth from her ear, only to continue down to nibble at her sensitive earlobe.  Moving down his hand, he now played with her belly as if it were a toy. Gently caressing her flab, he gave her a few sound smacks for emphasis, causing ripples to flow from her bulging middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think this is proper in public...\" she whined, causing Naegi to pick up the pace and bite her ear even harder, causing her to stifle a moan derived from shear pleasure. Naegi released his own limitations and took his other hand and released his hold on her rear for one brief second only to reach under her skirt and place his hand directly on her panty covered rear. While he wasn't able to see the color due to how much her body encompassed his vision, he was able to feel what type of style it was due to simply rubbing both cheeks quite sensually, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, plain cotton style eh? What a pure girl you are.\" whispered Naegi as he gave her immense butt a sharp pinch, causing her flabby figure to briefly jump, sending even more pressure down on Naegi's body. Shifting once more, he placed both hands on each of her overflowing and heavenly thighs.  Tracing the surface, he simply tried to grab as much flesh as possible, capturing a good amount with each handful. Before Naegi could continue farther with his plot, a loud ringing could be heard in the room. Coming to his senses, he had realized that the school bell had rung, signifying that they needed to head to class right away.  He released his tri-fold grasp on the silver haired girl who promptly rose from her 'seat' her body jiggling during the entire quick motion. With the weight off of him, Naegi took in a deep breath now that he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we need to postpone this to another day huh?\" he said as he followed Kirigiri out of the room after cleaning up their table. Feeling her face still warm, she looked away as she continued to walk to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose. It is within the nature of our relationship..\" she said, her voice lacking any confidence. Giving a smile, Naegi came closer to Kirigiri and wrapped his arm around her widened midsection, pressing her immense figure against his and gently fondling one of her soft love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I can't tell you how much I'm excited for our next private time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, I eagerly await it as w-well.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week had passed since 'Kirigiri's' arrival and so far, no one had questioned why she had suddenly doubled in weight.  Naegi made sure to keep his suspicions to himself, as he had to assume that everyone would consider the fatter Kirigiri to be something quite normal. If he went out and said otherwise, he might lose trust in the others, something he couldn't afford to lose. It was midday, the morning classes having come and gone with not much happening. The only thing that Naegi thought was out of place was the fact that 'Kirigiri' was constantly snacking during class and was never called out on it.  Naegi found himself in the library by his lonesome, doing some of his homework for the day. Even though he took it upon himself to discover the mystery of Kirigiri's sudden fattening, his school work was also incredibly important. Sitting in a remote corner of the library, he wanted privacy from other students and especially Kirigiri. Since their little 'struggle' the other day, she would continue her little attacks in order to secure some 'dominance' in their little relationship. Flipping the pages of his textbook, he was getting work done and writing down important notes. However, something incredibly soft was pressing against the back of his head, breaking all sense of concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there Naegi, how are you?\" asked Kirigiri in her standard monotone voice. With a smirk on her face, she continued to press her giant gut against Naegi's head, deciding that this was the best course of action in order to win some dominance.  A red tint growing on his face, he couldn't deny that her belly felt quite nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm just doing a bit of work, kinda wanna relax later on y'know.\" he said, trying to keep his voice as normal as possible in order to not show a sign of weakness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I study with you?\" she asked, pressing her blubbery belly against him even harder, almost engulfing him with her flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, it'd be good for both of us.\" he said, patting the chair right next to him. With a nod, she placed her bag on the table and sat her large rear down, her thighs oozing from the chair and pressing against the brown haired teen. Thinking it over, the situation playing out in front of him had happened quite frequently in the past week, and he knew how to handle it. Focusing on his work, he glanced over to see that Kirigiri was doing some studying as well. Despite her largeness and their 'fights,' Kirigiri did the same as Naegi and often focused on her work. Feeling like making the first strike, Naegi gently placed a hand on her thigh and squeezed, feeling how soft it felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Kirigiri, since you're not at lunch, have you eaten already?\" asked Naegi, continuing to fondle her leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a bit of food, enough to satisfy myself until after school.\" she said, ignoring his touch as she slowly felt herself 'warming up.' Naegi smirked at this, finding her particular weak spot for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find that a bit hard to believe. Your stomach needs a lot more then that to satisfy your lust for food.\" said Naegi, lunging over to grab her hefty belly, finally taking 'revenge' for her earlier actions. He groped at squeezed her gut, squishing rolls together, giving her a few slaps here and there, all to cause her to become much 'warmer.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-N-Naegi, I think it's important to focus on work.\" she muttered, still feeling him slapping her nice and rounded belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can afford to goof off every now and then. Like today, I got some treats for you.\" said Naegi, reaching into his bag and dumping out the contents in the bag, releasing numerous candy bars, sweets and other snacks that were easy to come by. With a smirk, he unwrapped a chocolate bar and presented it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is also within our relationship right?\" he asked, holding up the chocolate to her face. Her face began to grow a bit more red, as she slowly nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect, then feel free to dig in.\" said Naegi as he took a hold of her face with once hand, squeezing together her fat cheeks as he brought the sweet right to her mouth and watched her take a small bite, a bit of chocolate staining her pure white face. He let go of her face and let her eat the snacks one by one, her stomach slowly being filled up with sugar and empty calories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again, this is simply part of our relationship.\" she answered, her face still coated in both chocolate and a slight red hue. Feeling that he had gotten his point across, he put an arm around her and held her, the two sitting in quiet as they continued their studying and her eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kirigiri, you free this weekend? I'm thinking maybe we can just hang out and such.\" said Naegi, speaking with a sincere tone. She looked at him with a surprised expression, the sweets still staining her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, I might be open.\" she said, taking a bite out of some candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well let me know then.\" said Naegi, tightening his hug over her. </span></div></div>",

Rising bright and early, Naegi wasted no time readying himself with his best casual clothes and a hefty amount of yen in his pocket, most of what he had in his current reserves. Today was going to be quite an interesting time to say the least, so he needed to be prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the train down to the city centre, he waited patiently by the train station for the arrival of one \"Kirigiri\". Granted, Naegi had come very early, mostly due to his excitement about the following day. Knowing this, he waited patiently, checking his watch occasionally to keep up to speed with time. Eventually it came to his attention that even after coming early, Kirigiri had still found a way to be late. After half an hour of extra waiting, eventually Naegi was able to spot the hefty girl, her massive frame clearly visible in the sea of trim bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to Naegi, Kirigiri munched away at a large serving of Takoyaki, waving with a plump free hand over at him. Her dress was a little different for the day, though it was far from anything casual like Naegi had chosen. She wore a long sleeved white woollen shirt, buttoned up with a large amount of them holding the shirt, to be expected given the globular size of her belly. In turn she also wore a pair of pants, a simple design with a black colouring which made them fairly bald, but they did the job of containing her thick thighs and wide rear. While they were different clothes from her usual wear, they were far from what one would consider casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must apologise for being late Naegi.\" Kirigiri noted between mouthfuls of the tasty treats. \"I felt my breakfast wasn't sufficient enough so I got a snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's no problem Kirigiri.\" Naegi smiled as he walked over to her, hand firmly sunk into her gut. \"A girl like you needs to keep fed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri moved out the way, stuffing another ball into her mouth before nodding. \"That may be true, but it's also important for a girl to have a good time. You have kept that in mind for today, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I've made sure it'll be something both of us can enjoy.\" Going back over and linking his arm with her, flabby forearm squashing into his. \"Just follow close by me and we'll be there in no time.\" He shuffled closer as Kirigiri as she finished off the last of her Takoyaki, dumping the container in a nearby bin and licking any excess sauces that may have befallen onto her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire time the two of them walked to the destination the struggle was evident. Naegi tried his best to knead her fat with his slender hands, whilst Kirigiri focused on crushing his tiny self into her massive self, stroking his hair when she could. It was a heavily back and forth encounter, with both getting the upper hand in the struggle. However, it all ended when they reached the place Naegi had decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cinema?\" Kirigiri questioned. \"Are you sure?\" She took in the surroundings as they entered, the cinema a relatively popular one, bustling with people and very large. Her eyes drifted to the various food counters, part craving for the foods and part understanding what Naegi was up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, there's a drama on right now that I think we'll both enjoy.\" He held Kirigiri close, one hand around her arm and another around her large waist, barely meeting halfway so to play with some belly fat. \"Now then, I think we should get some food sorted out. How would you like to go about it?\"</span></div></div>",

Kirigiri nodded, slowly walking off, the pair having already bought the tickets earlier that afternoon. Entering the theater, she found some nice and comfy seats in the back, it would be enough to give them all the privacy that they would ever need. With Naegi, he managed to get a haul back to Kirigiri,including three bags of large popcorn, two large sodas, five boxes of candy and one frozen slushee. Carrying everything in a designed cardboard box, he slowly walked to the theater where the their movie was playing. Since the trailers have already started to play, it was rather dim in the large room, but he had a hunch to where Kirigiri was sitting. Heading towards the back row, he found her sitting down in the comfy seats. Even from far away, she looked quite snug in there. Walking up, he sat down right next to her, the girl's ample flesh spilling out into his seat. He placed the snacks on the seat next to him, since there would be no room on Kirigiri's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, let's start you off with some popcorn.\" he said, handing her a large popcorn as he placed the soda in the cup holder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Naegi, thank you greatly,\" she said as she happily took the salted treat into her chubby hands. With a smile, Naegi slinked his arm around her wide waist, gently cupping her love handles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, it is within our relationship after all.\" he said, a smile on his face. The movie rolled on, with Kirigiri continuing to eat her first bag and with Naegi gently rubbing her fluffy body. Soon, her doughy fingers would reach the bottom of the paper like bag, a bit of disappointment on her cute and rounded face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Naegi, I'm done with this one. Hand me the other.\" she said in a deadpanned voice, though her willingness to eat was still revving up. The browned hair young man nodded, handing her the second bag, his hand resting on her bulbous belly as he did the hand off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you're not full in the slightest are you?\" he snickered as he slapped her belly in a nice fashion. She shrugged this off, but her recent failings against him were taking a toll on her psyche. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, I'm getting a bit full at the moment.\" she lied, feeling herself slipping once more. This attack of his would continue, her eating snack after snack and Naegi gently fondling herself. By the time she was done with her last box of candy, Naegi was softly playing with her silver colored hair, enjoying the silky touch it brought him. Kirigiri was feeling another sensation right now, a great deal of pressure was building up in her lower half. Starting to feel pale, she looked down and only saw her immense belly that blocked all view to her lower and plumper half. She could tell what the issue was though. Those darn jeans! If only she hadn't been so stubborn to find something that fit her gratuitous lower half better. Reaching down she attempted to loosen the button to her jeans, the source of all her current discomfort. As she tried, she was blocked by Naegi who grabbed both of her fleshy hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think something like that would be part of my responsibilities.\"  he said, gently tapping her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Then p-please, help me out Naegi...\" she whimpered, wanting him to help her out.  Naegi ignored this plea, instead taking the last bag of popcorn and handing it to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, at least finish these up.\" he teased, tracing a finger on her plump and pale thigh. She nervously nodded, snacking on the popcorn, then drinking up the last soda and the reaching for the slushee for last. During the last few drips, the pressure built up, causing her great strife. In one swift motion, she surged her belly forward, the added momentum causing the button to snap off and embed itself in the seat in front of her. During the same act of nature, her belly tumbled onto her heavy lap, the flaps of her jeans laying on the very top of her thighs. The key point of all of this is that Naegi bared witness to the one thing that could be compared to the Holiest of Grails. The front of her panties laid full in display, the style being a pitch black and frilly type, something that was meant to catch the eye. In an instant, Naegi placed his hand right on her panties, feeling a combination of impeccable softness and warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, seems like you got a better sense of style.\" he muttered as he reached his hand even further.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even with this, I won't back down.\" he muttered. as he pressed his body closer to the overfed girl.</span></div></div>",

Her name Junko Enoshima.\" spoke an overweight pigged tailed blonde dressed in a stylish leopard skinned coat, fervently popping sweet and sour chicken nuggets in her mouth. She was sitting her wide butt atop her excessive amount of luggage, her thick thighs hanging over. Two well endowed orbs nestled above her bulging stomach which comfortably rested on her lap. Basking in the sensation of her outfit becoming tighter with each bite, Junko ceaselessly fed herself with the gooey high calorie food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLUUURRRP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a loud sip from a huge soda before proceeding on with her soliloquy, Junko scanned through the crowd. A chubby figure manifested among the passengers, many of which were thin women, far too thin for Junko's tastes. \"Just than a familiar face. Yes, the other of the weight gain sisters...The scrawny one... Mukuro Ikusaba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the feasting fashionista, the 'scrawny' one was rather pudgy. The highschool level soldier was uncomfortably dressed in tight-fitting clothes. Though not as corpulent as her sister, Mukuro was clearly heavier than the average girl with puffy cheeks, large breasts, thick legs, arm flab, and a pronounced muffin top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Junko. I'm grateful you came to meet me and all but, what are you doing?\" Mukuro asked, curious of the peculiar narrative spouting from her sister in between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUH!\" Junko muffled before gulping down her sweet n sour chicken to give her fervid answer \"I'm doing the narration!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay, cool.\" the mellow Mukuro responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAltering her tone, Junko adopted a more professional demeanor, narrowing her eyes as she focused on documenting the beginning of her diabolical plan. \"And so the event which would later bone all women, the greatest, most pants splitting incident in human history was finally set into motion that afternoon. Nobody realized it just yet but they would soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Junko\" A glazed eyed Mukuro sighed entranced by her ambitious sister's words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly later the weight gain sisters were riding in a limo stocked with fastfood from various venues, both girls chugging a half gallon soda. Mukuro calmly drank hers down in a somewhat serene manner while the spirited Junko drank in a more forcefully. Upon finishing, Junko let out an exasperated breath and grabbed a carton of onion rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me the truth. Do you have more freckles than you did the last time we got to hang out?\" Junko asked shoving an onion ring in her sister's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think I do?\" Mukuro responded obediently eating the onion ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a fact! Not some half-assed opinion! I'm testing your honesty dumbass!\" Junko said shoviing the entire contents of the carton in her sister's jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, I Don't..\" Mukuro answered through an onion ring stuffed mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My vision's 10,000 over 20, I see 'em.\" Junko informed her obediently eating sister as she reached for a carton of fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet that comes in handy as a plus sized fashionista.\" the girl said as she was vigorously fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs greasy fastfood was jammed down Mukuro's compliant mouth, the second of the weight gain sisters could only savor what was transpiring.  \"Wow...\" she thought  \"Junko's trying to fatten me to immobility with fast food.  She's such an artist. Trying to balloon her own sister with her bare hands, trying to taste that gluttony.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devious smirk emerged on her face as Junko than grabbed a huge burger. Grabbing her fair skinned sister's mouth, Junko crammed the burger in, carefully pressing the escaping burger back in with her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Junko, what an effect my immobile body would have on you.\" Mukuro fantasized becoming Junko's personal blob woman as she swallowed the burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good lord you're thin! Would it kill you to eat?\" Junko insulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMukuro happily accepted the debasement. \"But I eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you must have a metabolism fast enough to burn a buffet, cause damn!\" Junko commented as she grabbed a taco for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway why did you want me here in the first place Junko?\" Mukuro asked wiping the grease from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuz tomorrow's our highschool entrance ceremony.\" Mukuro looked bewildered. \"I'll spell it out for you so your remaining brain cells don't burst from the exertion okay. There's an elite highschool in our future, this place is so far up their ass they actually call it the highschool of hope. They want me of course and your toned ass is coming along for the ride.\" Junko managing to fit in an insult to her sister's posterior while growing hers with chicken strips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double trouble! They want us both.\" exclaimed an over joyed Junko tossing her arms in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really happy about this.\" Mukuro noticed her sister's smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I frickin ecstatic! My heart is beating a mile a minute just thinking about it.\" confessed the insidious Junko who commenced to shovel fast food in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A series of fast paced thuds echoed throughout the second floor hallway of Hope's Peak Academy as Tsumiki came tumbling down the staircase. As she landed in a sobbing, dusty mess, a high pitched laugh screeched forth from an absolutely tiny girl dressed in a traditional kimono.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. Oh my god this never gets old!\" Saionji grinned sadistically as we walked down towards the pathetic sight below her. She jumped the last two steps and landed within easy kicking distance of Tsumiki's side and gave her a quick strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why?!\" The nurse in training screamed in agony. \"W-what did I ever do to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! Ugly people don't have the right to talk!\" She reached into Tsumiki's back pocket and retrieved a packet of multi-colored gummi bears from within. \"There you are my lovelies!\" Her voice suddenly shifted drastically in tone, sounding much more childish and gleeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up, Ugly. I better not catch you buying the last pack of the world's greatest snack from the concession stand ever again. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry! If you had asked me, I would have given them to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You liar. If you knew I like them, you would have just given them to me right away.\" The dancer placed the gummis inside her robe and pulled out a large chocolate snack cake. \"Here.\" she dropped it on top of her. \"You can have this gross thing the person at the stand gave me instead of my gummis. It's heavy and hard to look at, just like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Ultimate dancer strode off, satisfied with the abuse she was able to wreak. The nurse slowly pulled herself to her feet as ground traffic resumed around her. Bruised and dirty, Tsumiki was truly a pitiable sight. But pity was not what she received. Throughout the day, jeers and insults were slung one after the other as she trudged through her classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's not all bad!\" She frantically thought to herself. \"S-she gave me something today! That means she must be warming up to me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ultimate nurse clutched the snake cake to her chest, and without thinking began unwrapping it and quickly shoved it into her mouth. The act earned her more than a few stares from her history class and an angered glare from the teacher, but she was too burned out from earlier to really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The bell rang, as per usual, Tsumiki waited for the others to head out so that she wouldn't have any confrontations with them. Once the room was absolutely clear, she picked up her things and walked to the cafeteria. As she entered though, she noticed a peculiar sight. No one was in line yet, nor was anyone sitting at any of the many identical tables that sat in the middle of the room; save for one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki's heart skipped a beat and she tried to turn around, but the door slammed behind her and was bared shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well.\" Saionji grinned. \"A little birdy told me that you were a total pig today in history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was just hungry!\" Tsumiki pleaded, knowing that what the tiny girl had planned could only be malicious. \"Please don't hit me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not going to hit you. In fact, I'm just here to give you a gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart settled, Tsumiki had not expected this. \"R-really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Saionji opened up her robes and out fell a dozen chocolate snack cakes and a quart of milk. \"All for you, you disgusting, dirty pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke, Koizumi stepped out of the kitchen with a digital camera and began recording the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't leaving until you eat every single one of these cakes like the fat pig you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes shot open wide in horror. \"But I can't possibly eat that many at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can! You're a pig, pig. Now you better start pigging out or you'll never make it to fifth period on time. You know what the headmaster will do if you're late again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrembling, the nurse slowly walked toward the pile of cakes on the ground. Tears streaming down her face as she did so. She kneeled down on the ground and slowly began the proccess of eating the first cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faster!\" The dancer shouted, spooking the nurse and forcing her to continuously eat more and more at an ever increasing rate. In a manner of five minutes she had managed to almost literally choke them all down, the offered milk the only thing that prevented her from keeling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horrible event over, Tsumiki collapsed. her bloated belly stuck out a few inches, pushing her nurse's uniform out slightly around the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoizumi stopped filming and Saionji stepped forward once more. \"Aw, and here I was hoping you might explode. Guess your fat stomach can take it after all.\" She walked over the stuffed girl and knocked three times on the door, causing it to open. \"See you tomorrow, loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko Enoshima watched with keen interest as the footage of the event lit up the computer screen in her private room. A red nailed hand slid down to her crotch and began stroking her in slow circles as her classmate was forced to shove large chunks of cake into her mouth. The final scene of Tsumiki collapsing into a gloriously glutted food coma was met with a quick moan from the young girl's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's... perfect.\" Junko grinned, inspired to shove a donut into her own mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Tsumiki found herself besieged by laughter and insulting names from pretty much the entire student body. Word of what she was forced to do had gotten out, and now even those she had thought were at least neutral to her pitiful existence were now out to make her life her life miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. You must be the worst nurse ever if you eat that much junk food.\" Someone jeered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a pig.\" Came another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-get away from me!\" A dark haired girl with large glasses screamed. \"I can't be seen with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch words were the background to her life for the rest of the day; and likely the would continue to be so for a month or so until the next big student scandal could distract them. She mechanically pushed herself through her classes, unable to respond to anything passed a lifeless look of despair. As the bell rang, she broke her usual pattern of waiting for all the others to go before her and bolted out into the hall. She ran until she arrived at her locker, which was buried in a rather poorly lit corner of the school. A fitting locale for someone as low as herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally having a moment's rest, Tsumiki looked down at her stomach. It was still slightly protruding from yesterday's events. She placed a hand over her stomach and began to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Why is everyone so mean?!\" She bawled. \"All I ever wanted was to make friends; and now everyone hates me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned against her locker and slumped to the floor. As she slid down, a tendril of streamer-like hair got caught in one of those random air vent like slits on the door of the locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again...\" She mumbled. Too miserable to put much thought into her actions, she first tried yanking it out. When that failed, she pulled herself back up to her feet and quickly entered her keycode into the digital lock and pulled it open. To her surprise, sitting on top of the few random things she usually kept in the locker was a large vanilla cupcake with bright red frosting and sprinkles placed on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki blinked to make sure that her eyes weren't deceiving her. She reached a shaky hand into the locker and pulled out the cupcake; below it was a note written in large, pink, cursive letters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey Tsumiki,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may not think much about your self, but I'm certainly thinking of a lot of you! Bleh, that was bad. Ignore that first part! What I'm saying is that you've got a lot of potential, and I think we could could go places, you and me. If you're tired of being pushed around, head over to the first floor kitchen after classes are over, and I'll change your whole world for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Your biggest fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. Here's a cupcake. I had it made just for you. So... eat it. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom of the note was a quick scribble of a black and white colored pig. Tsumiki's face reddened and her heart rate rose as she read through the short message. \"I...I have potential?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugged the note to her chest, her mouth drooling slightly in excitement. \"At last! I knew someone had to like me!\" She placed the note securely between her breasts and looked happily at the cupcake. \"This, this meeting can't come fast enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the school day was spent in gleeful anticipation, and for the first time in what must have been a awhile, Tsumiki managed to smile for the whole day. Even in the midst of the continual storm of schoolyard jeers that were flung that way, no amount of rain could dampen the Ultimate Nurse's proverbial parade. In hindsight, her unshaken good mood might have come across as somewhat creepy, but she certainly meant nothing malicious by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of 7th period, Tsumiki strolled over to first the cafeteria, before entering into the kitchen; humming the whole way. Not needed until dinner began, the kitchen was now dark and seemingly devoid of any other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello?\" The nurse called out. \"Is anyone here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, there was nothing but silence, then a spotlight appeared over a table towards the back of the room with a white cardboard box on top of it. Above the box was a monitor screen; which suddenly lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Greetings, Tsumiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A heavily altered voice boomed forth from the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" The voice startled Tsumiki. \"H-hi? Are you the one who wrote me that note.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Why, yes. I'm very eager to meet you. However, first I must see your potential firsthand. On this table is a box of delicious jelly filled donuts. Eat them. Eat them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...okay!\" Tsumiki nodded. The request was rather odd, and eerily similar to what she was forced to do yesterday, but if it meant meeting someone who appreciated her she would relive that day forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no further hesitation, she walked over to the box and began stuffing the sugar drenched treats into her mouth. Jellies of all colors and flavors passed over her tastebuds: first strawberry, then grape, blackberry, blueberry, apple, and even two that were filled with thick cream. The nurse moaned as more and more of the pastries stretched her stomach outward; bits of jelly and cream speckling her face and white nurse's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe synthetic voice spoke again, this time noticeably breathy and elevated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Yes... good, good. I was right to bring you here. You're just what I've been looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki's face reddened again. The compliment sent shivers down her spine. \"Thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a mechanical click, and suddenly Tsumiki found herself and the table descending downwards along a large elevator system. The fact that such a device existed within the school surprised her, as it looked like it was far bigger and more reinforced than what she expected was needed to move people up and down. After a few tense minutes, the elevator arrived at a large steel double door, deep under what she thought was Hope's Peak Academy's lowest extension. With the crunching of heavy gears, the door slowly pulled itself open, revealing an incredibly ornate room. Everything was lined with pink plush pillows, even the floor and walls. In the very center of the room was a massive chocolate fountain surrounded by a conveyor belt circling delicious looking cakes and candies waiting to be dipped. Scattered throughout the room were huge sofas for lounging, the kind you expected royalty to lay upon while they were fanned and fed grapes. Past this display of decadence was an advanced computer setup with over a dozen screens angled around a rather wide throne-shaped office chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Tsumiki.\" A powerful yet feminine voice rang throughout the room. \"Welcome to the first day of your new life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe throne spun around, revealing the rather corpulent form of Junko Enoshima. Her top had been altered to allow for her large, two rolled stomach to flow out into her lap. It was easily the most dominant feature on the former model. Resting on top of her grand gut was a pair of enormous breasts that greatly strained what little clothing she decided to wrap around herself. Her thighs were nice and thick, touching each other even while she was sitting. Overall she looked to be around 250lbs now, making every feature of her rounded and soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nit took a second for Tsumiki to recognize her. \"...Junko? What happened to you? No one's seen you in class for weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. That's not important now! I'm on to bigger and better things!\" She slapped her fat belly, sending ripples throughout her entire body. \"I've discovered the greatest feeling in existence, and I'm about to share it with the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a waist high stuffed pig fell from above and picked Tsumiki up, carrying her over to the sofa nearest to the computer screens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait!\" The nurse manage to yelp before she was sat down on the luxurious cushions. It was so comfortable it was disarming, and Tsumiki wasn't able to react before Junko walked over to the sofa and sat down, causing the cushion to sink slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first,\" Enoshima smiled. \"I want to share it with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent Tsumiki over so that her head was laying against her considerable belly, then began rubbing the nurse's still small yet stuffed stomach. Tsumiki still looked unsure of what was going on, but the former model was quickly able to cause her to relax. \"Ssh, no words now. Do not resist, just allow me to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer caresses were unlike anything Tsumiki had experienced before. To be touched so tenderly by a peer was something she never dreamed of happening. A haze of ecstasy quickly washed over the nurse as she contently leaned against the larger girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Isn't this nice?\" She waved a monochrome pig over, which carried over a tray full of cookies. She began picking up the offered cookies with her free hand and coaxed the nurse into opening up her mouth and accepting it. \"I can give you this forever, if you ask for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Tsumiki gladly nodded as another cookie was inserted into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" Junko purred. \"All that I ask in return is that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Worried that her first chance to be happy since grade school might disappear, she readily agreed with the odd proposal in hopes that it would cheer Junko up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it! If it means that I can stay here I'll do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooray~\" Another sudden change, her voice now incredibly preppy and all traces that she was crying a moment ago had vanished. \"Trust me, Tsu, you're like, totally going to love it here! My brand new Monopigs will cater to your every whim, so all you have to do is work on catering to mine! Now that's a good deal if ever I saw one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ultimate Nurse spent almost all of the next two weeks in the literal lap of luxury. A dozen or so Monopig drones would bring her platters of the finest foods throughout the day, and Tsumiki joyfully consumed them all to please her new benefactor. While she was dining on danishes, binging on fried beef, and practically inhaling her body weight in ice cream, Junko would caress her slowly growing stomach, thrilled at how routinely tight it was and how the foundation for a beautiful muffin top was being laid. Between meals and belly rubs, the blonde mastermind would slowly begin to unveil her grand scheme to her first underling. Though Tsumiki really couldn't make out the reasoning behind it, the plan was rather straight forward. Junko wanted to make all the girls at Hope's Peak Academy as fat as possible, and through them, create a future where obesity reigned supreme; with her as its corpulent queen. Tsumiki couldn't help but to nod agreeably with everything she was hearing. She was a force of personality unlike anything she had experienced before, and she was loving every minute of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the morning of the fourteenth day, Tsumiki awoke to find Junko's considerable cleavage pressing down against her face. Always forward with what she wanted, Junko had easily coaxed her into allowing herself to be crushed by the larger girl's weight at the former model's discretion with a few honeyed words. At first she found it uncomfortable, but the nurse quickly grew to like the closeness the habit brought with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're finally awake.\" Junko grinned her devilish grin. \"I have something special planned today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly rose off of Tsumiki's considerably smaller body, took her by the hand, and lead her to a smaller room towards the back past her huge monitor set up. Taking up almost the entire floor was a huge scale that looked like it was designed more to weigh semis than to weigh people. Without needing any further prompting, Tsumiki stepped onto the center of the scale. Moments later, a spotlight from above fell on her and a drum roll was started by a nearby Monopig. Then all of a sudden a triumphant \"tadaah!\" echoed throughout the room as confetti was rained down from above and a large digital display formed the number 151.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yes!\" Junko shouted, making rock and roll hand gestures. \"25 pounds in two weeks? Can I make a girl fat or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki smiled sheepishly. \"Are you pleased?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly approached her, pulling out a pair of glasses and putting her hair into a ponytail. \"Indeed. I must say that I did not expect such immediate results. Judging from your current progress-\" She reached out and grabbed a handful of the new dough that had formed around Tsumiki's middle. \"You're likely to be very belly heavy, as I had hoped.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grabbed Tsumiki sides, pleased to see that a pair of love handles were already developing, then examined the nurse's thighs to get an estimate for when they would start to rub together, and finally cupped her breasts and squeezed tightly. Tsumiki was becoming quite giddy from the experience, her low willpower causing her to moan with pleasure as Junko felt her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mastermind's smile only became wider as she noticed her arousal. In an instant, her glasses were replaced with a large crown and her hair was put back into place. \"Yes! Good!\" Her voice boomed. \"You are now ready to spread my influence to the ignorant fools above! Your first task, my dear consort, is to approach someone I believe to be vital to the success of my grand plan and woo them to my cause!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn image of the Ultimate Detective appeared on a nearby screen. \"This is your target, Kyoko Kirigiri! She doesn't have any classes with you, so your recent \"vacation\" shouldn't alarm her any. And if it does, I've already had it cleared with the attendance records anyways. Lastly, all the information that I have on her can be found installed in your I.D. device. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None at all!\" Tsumiki declared zealously. Her devotion was rewarded with a long kiss from Junko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Now go, and don't forget to eat your fill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator that had carried her to her new life days ago now returned her once more to the first floor kitchen of Hope's Peak Academy. As the gears ground away, Tsumiki quickly brought up all the dirt that Junko had given her on this Kirigiri character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see...\" She thought to herself as she moved files around on the touch pad. \"Ultimate Detective... very observant of her surroundings... paranoid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki began to tremble, this didn't seem like the person to whom she could easily come into contact with and win over. But she couldn't turn back now. She had been given an order by Junko herself, and she couldn't bear the thought that she might disappoint her. Not now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, finally something I can use!\" She jabbed her finger into the pad. \"Close with those in her inner circle.... Makoto Naegi and Aoi Asahina... If I can become friends with them first, then I'll be able to get them all down to see her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face flushed as she brought both hands to her heart. \"Yes...I'm sure she would be very happy with me if I managed to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator door swung open, and she stepped out into the cafeteria unnoticed by the students lining up for breakfast. Joining them, she began to search around the room for her prospective targets, managing to spot...</span></div></div>",

She had seen Aoi walk into the same classroom that Kyoko attends. She had also heard people whisper in the hallways about Aoi's \"donut fetish\" and how she was willing to do anything for a donut.<br>\r\n\"This is perfect!\" Tsumiki thought to herself as she summoned five Monopigs to her assistance using the pager that Junko had given her.<br>\r\nTsumiki ordered four of the Monopigs to get her as many donut boxes as they could carry so that she could find out which donuts tasted the best, while she ordered the last one to follow her in secret so that it could record Aoi's voice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days later, a much larger Tsumiki was watching Aoi from a distance. They were in the cafeteria again, and Tsumiki's plan was finally coming into fruition. Tsumiki's body had changed drastically in the last few days. She 4 boxes of donuts a day as \"snacks to tide her over between meals\" and her body had gained a lot of weight. She now weighed about 200 pounds. Her cheeks had gotten quite a bit puffier, and she has started to grow a second chin. Her breasts had begun to swell as well, and they were now 6 inches bigger than they were two days ago. Her butt had also grew a considerable amount, and she now had trouble fitting into her desk chair at school. Her stomach had changed the most, and it now had thick, heavy love handles that Junko loved to squeeze. \"This is it!\" Tsumiki thought to herself as she signaled the Monopig to start the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Monopig played the recording of Aoi's voice. Tsumiki had gotten a little girl named Chihiro to splice her words together so that it would sound like she was saying something that she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Leon!\" the Monopig played, \"Aren't you a little fat for a rock star?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon turned around to look at the completly oblivious Aoi, who was lost in her donut. \"Your one to talk, glutton!\" Leon shouted as he threw her donut across the room. Aoi was so shocked at this sudden turn of events that she didn't even say anything to Leon as he walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki approached Aoi with 4 boxes of donuts. \"Oh my gosh, that was crazy!\" Tsumiki said. \"Do you want to have some of my donuts? I have plenty to spare.....\"<br>\r\n\"Yes please!\" Aoi exclaimed as she opened up the first box that she could get her hands on and started eating like a pig.<br>\r\n\"MMMMPH, I love cream filled donuts!\" Aoi said, as she took another donut out of the box. \"Thanks a lot, um, who are you, again?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, my name is Tsumiki. And it's no problem, really. I have donuts all of the time, so I figured that I could spare a few today.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Aoi said, \"You eat boxes of donuts like this all of the time?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Tsumiki said plainly.<br>\r\n\"So, like, are you doing anything after school?\"<br>\r\n\"I am free to do whatever you want.\" Tsumiki said as a small smile appeared on her face.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nTwo weaks later, a much heavier Asahina ran up to Kyoko. Aoi had been spending all of her free time with Tsumaki, and it really showed. Her face had become much chunkier, with two full developed chins on her head. Her breasts and butt had grown exponentially, and her stomach was now separated into two rolls of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYOKO!\" Aoi shouted.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Kyoko said, with an annoyed look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's thins friend of mine that you've just GOTTA meet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Junko smiled at the progress that had been made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After she's done with Kyoko, she'll ready for her next assignment...\"</span></div></div>",

While Asahina's deplorable diet was known to all, she was also a very energetic and active person who swam almost as much as an olympic athlete; so the inevitable ill effects of her eating habits were never witnessed. Now however, it seemed as though several months worth of extra sugar, carbs, and fat had been added to her frame all within a very narrow time period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Asahina, I did not here that. Could you please step closer and say it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" The swimmer dashed over as if to whisper into her ear. \"I was just saying that I met a new friend and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words were cut off as Kirigiri's gloved hand suddenly grabbed hold of her tanned belly flesh. Her fingers pinched and kneeded the dough of her stomach for a few seconds.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Wha- Kiri, what the hell are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty pounds? Forty pounds of what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. There are forty excess pounds of you that have been added on since we last spoke outside of class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahina crossed her arms in annoyance. \"Hahaha, very funny.\" She said sarcastically. \"I know I've let myself go a little bit, but you really need to work on how you break it to people, Kiri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a 'little bit', such a drastic change in your weight could have only occurred through an equally drastic change in your weekly schedule. You haven't gone to your swimming club once since you last talked to me, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Asahina was getting mad. \"Yeah, you're right. I did miss swim practice all last week... and the week before that, but it's because I was trying to be nice and hang out with my new friend! Now let go of me!\" Asahina twisted herself out of Kirigiri's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm just concerned that something bad might have happened to you.\" The detective closed her eyes in thought as the apology set in. \"Now please, tell me about this new friend of your's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure! Her name is Tsumiki and I think I heard her say she was studying to be a nurse... She's pretty timid, so we usually hang out somewhere quiet like our dorm rooms, the library, or the cafeteria after hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes suddenly opened. \"The cafeteria is locked after hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, not for her! Not only that, but she has access to literally the BEST. DONUTS. EVER!\" She leaned in and whispered into the detective's ear. \"Which is probably why she's a little on the chunky side if you know what I mean. She eats like its going out of style!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I see. Do you happen where she is? I'd like to meet her before class resumes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! That's why I came and got you in the first place. Now come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective rubbed her ear to recover from the close proximity shouting as she followed the now very buoyant swimmer through the halls. The two girls heard more than a few snide comments about how Asahina, mostly involving the word \"whale\", but neither paid them any mind. After they reached the third floor, with some effort on Aoi's part, they made their way over to the rec room. As Kirigiri opened the door, she observed it's sole occupant was a very chubby black haired girl dressed in a white nurse's outfit that was drawn far too tightly across her body, making her prominent love handles very visible through the tight fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tsumiki, I'm back!\" The swimmer waved, her softened arms jiggling slightly with the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" The nurse smiled back. \"Is this the friend you mentioned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. This is Kyoko Kirigiri. She's kind of rough around the edges, but once you get to know her she can be a real softy.\" She patted the detective on the back. \"Isn't that right, Kiri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective crossed the room over to where Tsumiki was sitting. To her left was a rather large plushie of a black and white striped pig which the detective couldn't help but be slightly creeped out by. She stopped right in front of the nurse and stared at her with her piercing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um... it's very nice to meet you!\" Tsumiki stood up and offered her her hand. The detective extended her hand, but not to accept the shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Tsumiki yelped as the detective dug her hand into her belly. As she had come to associate such aggressive grabbing as a show of her boss and lover's affection, her face involuntarily flushed red with arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsumiki Mikan.\" The detective used her free hand to open her digital profile. \"Your registration lists your weight at 126 pounds. Now however, I would say you weigh... one hundred and ninety...four. 194 pounds. Over the last month, half of which you were mysteriously absent from class, you've managed to gain 68 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyoko! What the hell?!\" Asahina slapped her hand away from the nurse's stomach. \"Look at her face! You're embarrassing her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, it's okay... please don't fight.\" Tsumiki waved her hand to fan her face to try and cool her off. \"She is right, though. I've gotten huge... after Saionji humiliated me with that video, my parents pulled me out of school to wait for things to cool off. I was so distraught I tried everything I could to blot the pain out... and wound up doing it mostly with pastries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri crossed her arms. \"I don't even want to begin to think about how many donuts you must have to pull this off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" The nurse hadn't expected such direct questioning. \"...a lot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough for you to completely absorb Asahina's free time, to say the least. Which raises another question, you're notorious for being painfully shy, to the point that approaching people becomes a burden. How exactly did you and Aoi start talking on a regular basis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- we just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just offered me a donut after that loser Leon swatted one out of my hand, okay?\" The swimmer came to the rescue of her new friend. \"Sheesh, Kirigiri. You're acting like you suspect Tsumiki of committing murder or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri sighed. \"No, not murder. Though I suppose you're right, I have been too distrusting. I hope you can accept my apology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! S-sure, of course!\" Tsumiki flashed a big smile. \"Any friend of Aoi's is a friend of mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" Asahina wrapped an arm around each of them, needing to stretch a little bit to get all the way around Tsumiki's waist. \"We're all friends now, so let's stop pointing fingers for no reason, okay Kiri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Understood.\" The detective nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Aoi released both of them. \"So, Tsumiki and I were planning to go hang out in Shibuya once class ends. Ya wanna come along Kiri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirgiri closed her eyes in thought once more. <i>Hmm... it has been awhile since I left the school grounds, but I'm still not sure about this Tsumiki person. Based on what I've gathered so far, I can conclude...</i></span></div></div>",

The princess of a micro nation located along the Baltic coast, she came across as everything a high schooler might expect a member of a modern day royal family to be. She was graceful, eloquent in a dozen different languages, and had a kind yet forceful personality that seemed to draw followers to her like a magnet. Yet despite her royal demeanor, she had a few... \"interests\", that would disturb even the most hardcore of the student body at Hope's Peak Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Sonia noticed that the teacher was preoccupied with chewing Souda out over listening to music in class, she quickly slipped a magazine out of her backpack and lined it up along the inside of her text book.

Third time this month.</i> Sonia read the headline in her head as a wide smile spread out across her face. She studied the released photo of the crime scene with perverse glee.

The fact that he beats the odds every time and they never have any evidence against him is just...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang, announcing the end of class. Sonia quickly slammed her textbook shut and slid it back into her backpack, before exiting the class and meeting up with her friends Gundam and Hinata near a row of lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hail and well met, princess.\" The beast master smiled as he summoned one of his hamsters Jum-P to acrobatically leap off his extended arm and land in Sonia's waiting hands. \"The day is yet young, how might we spend it to fulfill our true potential as the true rulers of this school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Sonia gave the question some thought as she brought the hamster up to her shoulder and nuzzled it with her cheek. \"I know! Since we have the next day off on holiday, why don't we throw a big party for everyone? We can request that the cafeteria stay open later to host dinner, hang out in the rec room, and we can encourage everyone to show off their dormitories!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGundam crossed his arms and smiled knowingly. \"Ah, an excuse to collect the excitable souls of the youth together in one place. Where we will be able to properly harness the pulsating vitae of life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Sonia cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sweat drop formed on the back of Hinata's neck as the princess and beast master continued to go on about \"Souls\" this and \"Demons\" that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, now that I think about it my friends are really weird...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki sat on a stone bench in the middle of a hallway, leaning back so as to balance her electro id between the rising curve of her belly and her considerable and as of the last few pounds, unbound cleavage. Walking around bra-less was awkward to say the least, and she shuddered at the thought of someone realizing she was topless under her overtaxed uniform. However, Junko was so turned on by the notion that her concubine had gotten too fat for her old bras that she had ordered her to go without for the next three days; sealing the deal with a promise that she would take her clothes shopping for the most luxurious and sexy plus sized outfits if she were to successfully comply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonia...Nevermind.\" Tsumiki murmured the foreign name to try and get used to saying it. According to her file, she was a very kind yet strong person. She and Tsumiki were actually in the same homeroom group and had wanted to try and make friends with her for awhile, yet was never able to summon the courage to go up to her. Not that it mattered too much now. The only goal that existed within the somewhat unhinged girl's mind was to please Junko in every way possible, and in turn be rewarded with the love and affection she had previously only dreamed of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Miki!\" Asahina called out to her using the new nickname she had chosen for her new friend. The nurse looked up to see the swimmer's abundant form approaching rapidly; and the somewhat chubby detective approaching at a much slower pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki looked up from her work. \"Oh! H-hey... glad you could make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I'm totally down to hang out with my new friend whenever the opportunity arises!\" Asahina was clearly pumped. \"So what's on tap for today? We can take a quick dive in the pool, check up on how Naegi's handling cram session, maybe pick up some donuts...\" Asahina turned her head to address Kirigiri. \"What do you think Kiri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri glared and looked around Asahina to get a view of Tsumiki. \"You're not wearing underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki's face immediately went beet red and she turned away and hid her breasts behind her arms. \"I-That's-....That's true, I'm not. Nothing fits my anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled giggle escaped from the Monopig sitting next to the nurse. Asahina scootched it over so that she could sit next to Tsumiki and comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry about it! Barely any of my old stuff still fits either, so I had to go into town and pick up some new clothes last weekend.\" She gave the nurse a reassuring smile, before sliding in even closer and pressing her boobs against Tsumiki's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep! W-what are you doing?\" She started to turn even redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I just wanted to compare sizes real quick. Hmm, it looks like we're around the same, so if you want we can totally stop by my room real quick and I can give you some pairs to hold you over until we can find an excuse to go into town again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! T-thank you...but, I couldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? I'm totally fine with you seeing them.\" She glanced upwards.  \"I mean, it's not like they're really risque or something if that's what you're worried about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-...I...\" Tsumiki was beginning to stutter incoherently. She wanted to accept such a kind act, but she also knew if she took them, she would be expected to wear them, meaning she would not be able to go the extra mile for her true love. Such a dilemma might have proven to be too much for her, but she was suddenly saved from answering by a sudden interjection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Tits off my broad, dough for brains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeh?!\" Asahina's head darted around the room, looking for the source of the voice. \"Did someone say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not someone.\" Kirigiri crossed over to the bench and grabbed the monopig by its neck. \"Something. This overstuffed doll just spoke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki had to say something fast. \"Oh! It-it does that. That's a rare Monopig Classical plushie. If you tap it's belly it says things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko slapped the doll in the stomach with the back of a gloved hand. \"...Hey kids! I'm Monopig! Remember, if you don't find me in your Christmas stocking this year, your parents are probably gonna put you up for adoption!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective stared at the doll in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehe... We must have accidently hit it when Aoi sat down.\" Tsumiki offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri tossed the Monopig to the ground. \"What a perverse creation. Aren't we a little old to be carrying stuffed animals around school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually.\" Aoi spoke. \"I think I saw something in the school newsletter saying that evil toys had suddenly become big as a fashion accessory. Miki must just want to get in on the ground floor of the new trend.\" She gave the nurse a pat on the back, sending ripples throughout her soft, squishy flesh. \"Isn't that right, Miki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden conversational swing in her favor renewed her. \"Yes, that's it! I just wanted to try and be cool for once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Kiri? No harm done. Hey, maybe we should get creepy toys too! I can get an otter that breathes fire, and maybe you can get one of those slender persons the internet likes to talk about!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass.\" The detective said without missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're no fun!\" She turned back to face Tsumiki. \"So Miki, did you actually have something planned for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could answer, a trio of students led by Sonia rounded the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGundam was the first to speak. \"My word. It seems as though the gluttony demoness that possessed our classmate Tsumiki hath found kindred spirits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... did you just say that Tsumiki made friends with someone?\" Hinata ventured. \"Because if so then yes, that does appear to be the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone.\" The princess waved. \"Would any of you be interested in attending a party tonight? It will be great fun if you stop by!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yes we'll be there!\" Aoi shouted without a moment's hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Please come by the cafeteria at six o'clock sharp! I promise there will be a royal welcoming for everyone!\"</span></div></div>",

She was even more startled to see that it was Tsumiki that was at her doorstep. <br>\r\n\"U-um, hello. I wanted to give you this basket as a token of gratitude. I mean, I don't really get invited to that many parties...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense! You don't need to thank me!\"<br>\r\n\"O-oh, but I insist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki gave Sonia the basket. Before Sonia could thank Tsumiki, she had already stormed off.<br>\r\n\"Well, that was nice of her. I'll have to thank her before at the party today.\" Sonia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia looked at what was in the basket. The basket contained several horror movie-themed candies, like Gummi Ghostfaces, Jason chocolates, and Leatherface Licorice. On top of the assortment of sweets, there was an adorable stuffed pig. Sonia knew stuffed animals were all the rage nowadays, and she placed the pig on the pillow of her bed before she opened her assortment of sweet and scary treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n6:00<br>\r\nThe cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople had started to arrive at the party, and they were suprised to see a wide arrangement of food on the tables. Sonia had contacted Hanamura earlier, and he had supplied this occasion with a wide variety of food, in exchange for a pair of Sonia's panties (which she gave to him, because she didn't know why a boy would want a woman's undergarments.) <br>\r\nAfter Sonia welcomed the party attendee's, everyone started eating food at the tables and socializing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Makoto?\"<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Ibuki?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, it's just, well, where's Leon?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, last week, Mondo heard about how Leon smacked a doughnut out of Aoi's hands, so Mondo beat the crap out of him. He's in the hospital, and he'll be out in three days.\"<br>\r\n\"Whew. Ibuki's glad to hear that. Leon wouldn't stop bugging me about joining his band.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n7:55<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dinner, they hung out in the rec room for about an hour and fifteen minutes before they decided to go and check out each others dorm rooms. Very few students actually attended this little gathering, because most of them didn't want their classmates to see how messy their rooms are. The only people that were going on this little tour where Sonia, Hanamura, Kyoko, Makoto, Hinata, Souda, Gundham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Sonia, when you said that we were going to show off our dormitories, I didn't think that you meant that we would be showing people our rooms.\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n\"Well, of course we're showing each other our rooms. Why wouldnt we? What else is there to show people in a dormitory aside from the dorms themselves?\"<br>\r\n\"A lot. There's the theater room, the bowling allie, the manga cafe...\"<br>\r\n\"Silence. You dare question the princess?\" Gundam said with great authority. <br>\r\n\"So......why are you on this trip again, Hanamura?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n\"I thought that I could use this as an opportunity to steal some panties from some of the girls. Alas, only two are on this trip, but a man makes due with what he is given...\" Hanamura said as his nose started to bleed.<br>\r\n\"Try it and your dead.\" Kyoko said with great malice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko was only attending this trip so that she could do a search of Hanamura's room so that she could find some evidence that he was behind her recent weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, everyone! This is my room!\" Sonia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone filled the room, Kyoko asked Sonia where she had gotten the suspicious looking toy on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Well, Tsumiki gave it to me as a present!\"<br>\r\n\"Really...\" Kyoko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nTwo weeks later.<br>\r\n\"So, Hanamura's still in the hospital?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Mondo destroyed him after he heard about how he tried stealing one of Sonia's bras.\"<br>\r\n\"Speaking of Sonia...\"<br>\r\nThe two students looked up and waved as the heavy princess waddled by. She had gained a lot of weight these past two weeks. Her stomach was divided into two thick, dough rolls that draped over her like an apron. Her breasts had grown 5 sizes bigger. Her butt was much, much bigger. Her hips were massive. Her cheeks were much puffer, and she now had three chins.<br>\r\nShe didn't care about her weight gain, though. She had always wanted to be fat, but she never had the appetite to try and gain any weight. Her weight gain didn't cause her to lose any of her many suitors. In fact, she now had more suitors then she did before her weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Junko's hideout...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ooh, ah....\" Tsumiki said as her lover Junko gave her a nice, oily massage between every fold of fat on her body. <br>\r\nTsumiki had gotten fatter over the course of these last few weeks, but she was not nearly as fat as Sonia was. Tsumiki had gained a meager five pounds these last few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, tell me again how you fattened up Ms. Nevermind?\" Junko said as put glasses on. (Note:She was still giving Tsumiki the massage.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki paused for a moment, and then she replied. \"Ah-h, well, I-I put some very sp-special drugs inside of the candy that I gave to her. Ones th-that have may exotic effects, such as decreased motabolisim, increased hunger, and increased drowsiness.\" Tsumiki said as she barely kept her sensual murmurs under control.<br>\r\n\"Oh. I see. So you used the same method on both Kyoko and Sonia, huh.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. I t-told you this before. The Monopig that I gave her should provide a consistant supply of candy to her basket. She won't notice that her candy boxes h-have one or two more pieces of candy in them, because she only eats one piece of each type of candy per day.\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nAfter the massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, bitch, are you ready for your next assignment?\" Junko said as she stuck her tongue out.<br>\r\n\"That d-depends, what will my reward be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naked pictures of yours truly.\"<br>\r\n\"Who's my target?\"<br>\r\n\"Celestia Ludenburgh.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once the oil had fully soaked into Tsumiki's skin, Junko led her into another room of her astonishingly large and decadent secret underground lair. Before them was a huge marble lined bath that was filled with water by six classically carved Monopig statues each holding a Greek amphora in various poses. Once the bath was completely full, Junko tossed her school uniform off, gave two of the statues the middle finger, and did a very ungraceful belly flop into the steaming water. Having grown  used to the more peculiar aspects of her lover's mind, Tsumiki paid little attention to the odd choice of action, and simply joined her once her clothes had also been fully removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes passed between the two of them before either spoke. Tsumiki was sitting between Junko's outstretched legs, leaning back to rest her head against the mastermind's very prominent cleavage. Meanwhile, Junko would use one hand to gently caress the nurse's ribbon like hair, and the other to grab handfuls of Tsumiki's extra fat along her stomach, hips, and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm. You're getting so big.\" She cooed. \"All this lovely fat rounding out your figure, it kinda makes me wanna...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko's hand slowly became more delicate in it's motions as it traveled closer and closer to Tsumiki's intimate areas. Soft moans of pleasure escaped from her mouth as she felt her womanhood being prodded underneath the water. She was always amazed at how smoothly Junko moved during their most intimate times. Before she could voice a request, her lover was already fulfilling her whims. It was as if she were a book that Junko could masterfully guess every surprise twist and turn that might be contained inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Tsumiki was beyond happy that was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko smiled as she finished her work. Tsumiki was truly putty in her hands, her's to do with however she pleased. With one final murmur of ecstasy, Tsumiki slid deeper into the water, so that only her head was still breaking the surface. The mastermind gently adjusted her seat so that the nurse could rest her head comfortably on her plush stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was that, my dear?\" Her words were as honeyed as could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki could only mutter positively in response as her head sunk deeper into Junko's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...\" A Monopig placed a pair of glasses on her head and pulled her hair back. \"Now then, business after pleasure. Dearest Tsumiki, it has come to my attention that you completed your last two assignments using weight and metabolism altering drugs; as one might expect from your role as the Ultimate Nurse. While I can't complain about your results, I'm beginning to feel that you may become complacent in your tasks; which we simply can't have now that our detective friend has finally started to wise up. In light of this, I'm going to have to prohibit you from using your usual method for carrying out my tasks for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki tensed up, her euphoria coming to a sudden halt. \"U-understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko suddenly shuddered, the glasses falling into the bath and her hair falling forward. \"P-please don't be mad... it's not that I don't value what you've accomplished so far, it's just it's too early for our operation to be exposed. So we need to try something new this time around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReassured, the nurse relaxed a bit. \"Of course! What do you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crown was suddenly placed on top of Junko's head, her hair tied into her usual large tails. \"I'm glad you asked my dear consort! Now, listen to my words very closely...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri skirted along the walls of the main dormitory hallway, an id card clutched in her hands. While she wasn't able to fully examine Hanamura's room during the party due to the presence of the others, she was able to lift the spare card key from his room. Thanks to his timely trip to the hospital though, she now had free access to investigate his belongings; an opportunity she couldn't afford to let pass by if she wanted to get to the bottom of this rather peculiar case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the detective crept up to the cook's door, swiped the card, and silently slipped into the room. Every corner had some cooking appliance shoved into it, and hanging along two metal poles stretched above were every cooking utensil known to man. Lecherous though he was, Hanamura was at least dedicated to his work as a chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I were Hanamura, where would I hide something incriminating...</i> She glanced around the room, noting an overstuffed pillow sat atop the bed. <i>There.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yanked the pillow off the bed and emptied its contents. A pair of Sonia's panties came tumbling out, slowly dropping from the air and landing at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri bent down and picked them up. After making sure there was no secret note stored within, she tossed them aside. After an hour of digging through every nook and cranny for something she could use against him to no avail, the detective was forced to conclude that there was nothing here to help her case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on the bed and pulled open her notebook, noting with some disdain that her rounded ass sunk into the mattress a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Examined Hanamura's room, nothing connecting him to recent weight gain pandemic.-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished scrawling the note, then flipped it open to a new page and began writing her thoughts on the rest of the information she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Identical stuffed pig delivered to Sonia's dormitory. Within two weeks she becomes fatter than either Aoi or Tsumiki; a completely unprecedented gain. All cases of weight gain began after either acquiring one of those pigs or becoming acquainted with Mikan Tsumiki. Tsumiki does not seem capable of such a plot, therefore, it is likely that the supplier of these dolls is somehow manipulating her.-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a moment to consider if she should add anything else, she closed the book and slipped back out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is such an absurd plot. What is there to gain from fattening up the female members of our class?</i> She flipped open her phone and pulled open the speed dial list. <i>...Perhaps there is no reason. Which may be in of itself dangerous... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotoko Naegi's name came up, and her slightly thicker thumb pressed down on the send button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki sat in the cafetria, looking over a pink floral piece of paper covered in flowing, elegant hand writing as she had breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Handsome servants humbly requested.-<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-Do you possess a certain physique? One that may be referred to as \"Herculean\", \"Sculpted\", or dare I say it, \"Powerful\"? Do you possess a quick mind equally skilled in intrigue and analysis? Are you well versed in all of the finer things in life? If you answered yes to these questions, then I wish to recruit you as my personal manservant. Come to the cafe between the hours of 7 and 9. The interview process will be vigorous and exhilarating, so be prepared.-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis note and several others had been placed around the school by none other than the Ultimate Gambler herself. The timing couldn't have been better. Junko planned to use this call as a means to find someone who would cater to her every whim, preventing her from lifting a finger. She knew that the Europhile wanted to live like a queen, and such a lifestyle came with an unavoidable thickening of the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem was that Tsumiki couldn't possibly apply for the role herself, being neither \"Sculpted\" nor \"Handsome\". Then there was the fact that she wasn't friends with any of the boys in school, and wouldn't know where to begin to try and convince one of them to sign up even if she did know someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit down heavily on a mouthful of cinnamon roll, chewing as images of Enoshima's naked form striking alluring poses hung in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehehe...\" She smiled dorkily as she day dreamed, a tiny bit of drool forming in the corner of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, she suddenly shook her head as she remembered that the interviews were today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Focus, Tsumiki! You can't let her down!</i> Desperately, she reached for her phone and brought up her contact list. She had acquired most of her classmates names during her stay here, but up until now she had been too afraid to ever call one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please, please work!</i> She begged as she touched the dial button.</span></div></div>",

He had rather tan skin, and deep green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there. I am here about the job that you posted. A girl named Tsumiki referred me to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're hired.\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nThree weeks had passed, and Celeste could not be happier. She now had three servants, all of which had been referred to her by a girl named Tsumiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleste also gained around 50 pounds. While she wasn't as fat as Sonia or Tsumiki, she was on the path to getting there. Her breasts, butt, stomach, hips, and face had all become pudgier. Celeste didn't notice this, however, as she was too busy being lost in the bliss of having personal servants cater to her every whim. She hadn't gone to class in three weeks, because Hifumi took all of her notes and did all of her homework for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junpei!\" Celeste said with great authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, miss Ludenberg\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to receive some more frosted scones and tea, please.

There were almost a hundred of them, and each and every one of them were dazzling, to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tsumiki. What are you looking at?\" Aoi asked as she sat next to Sonia at Taumiki's lunch table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? O-oh, nothing!\" Tsumiki said as she put the pictures back into her book bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so. Anyway,  Sonia and I would like to thank you for telling our cousins about that job opportunity. That was really nice of you, you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia could only nod in agreement to Aoi's statement, as she was busy slurping down an extra extra extra large bowl of barbecued pork ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, it was nothing....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n\"Kyoko, aren't you being a little.....uh......paranoid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi, don't be stupid. I've gained 95 pounds since I started hanging out with Tsumiki. Sonia, Aoi, and Celeste have all gained weight as well. That can't be a coincidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto and Kyoko were eating lunch. Kyoko had started eating more, thanks to a new drug that Tsumiki had introduced to her coffee. Kyoko was eating an entire deep fried chicken for lunch, won mashed potato's on the side, and cake for dessert. She was drinking a large sized jug of coffee.<br>\r\n\"I think that your recent weight gain has more to do with the eating habits that you picked up from her, and less to do with some bizarre scheme....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko glared at Naegi. \"Fine. If you won't help me, then I'll ask Hajime for assistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Tsumiki recieved a text message on her cell phone from Junko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you manage to get the next girl fat, I'll buy some very daring lingerie for both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's my next target\"<br>\r\n\"Peko Pekoyama\"</span></div></div>",

Before them were a wide array of cards displaying various monsters and environments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha!\" Gundam laughed as he piled tokens onto a card. \"My mighty goblin army now numbers more than the stars in the heavens! I unleash their might upon your pitiful white denizens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, you guys win again.\" Hinata sighed while Souda slammed his fist into the table. They both took out a small stack of yen bills and handed them over to Gundam and Kuzuryu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he received his prize money, the beast master's face suddenly became serious and he locked eyes with Hinata.\"You've lost your touch, my friend. For these past three weeks, I have seen your skill be sapped into the aether. Diabolic forces are truly at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sweatdrop formed on the reserve student's neck. \"That's because I built my deck to synergize with Sonia's blue one, but ever since that party we had she's been ditching us to hang out with Tsumiki. So now when you two demand we continue to only play 2v2, I have to make do with Souda as my tag team partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGundam wrapped his scarf around his mouth, a tell Hinata knew signaled that he was emotionally conflicted. \"...I too have missed her presence. Our free time has truly suffered without her radiant aura to inspire us. Oh, if only I had the arcane power to free her from the clutches of that demonic glutton...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata rubbed the back of his neck nervously. <i>Sheesh, when's the wedding? I knew you missed her, Gundam, but not this much...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuzuryu shoved his winnings into an interior pocket on his pinstripe coat. \"Whatever. We can't tell the princess what to do. If she wants to join Club Fatass, fine by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine?! How can anyone be fine with this? What's happening to Sonia is an international tragedy!\" Souda roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least someone agrees with my sentiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four players turned to the door, which was suddenly barged open by the engorged form of Kyoko Kirigiri. \"Though I imagine the driving reason behind your feelings on the matter is different than mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Kirigiri.\" Hinata waved awkwardly. \"I don't suppose you came because you have a strategy that works well with a white deck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not come here to play your card game. I came here to ask for your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... with what, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Discovering the mastermind behind the expansion of several of our female classmates. Try as I might, I was not able to convince Naegi that our sudden weight gain was more than just the culmination of bad habits, so I come to you. Your skills are very similar to Naegi's, and would be of great help in my investigation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thanks?\" Hinata scratched his head. As someone without a particular skill, he was unused to thinking that he had any talents on par with the titled members of the student body. \"I guess I can see what I can do. Do you actually have evidence that someone is intentionally making people fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective retrieved a large manila folder from her coat. \"I was hoping you would ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the table, her body jiggling heavily with each step. She opened the file and unceremoniously dropped its contents onto their playing table. A notebook, profiles of the so far fattened girls, and a picture of a Monopig spread out from the initial impact, obscuring their cards and tokens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This whole incident started over two months ago, when Tsumiki Mikan returned from an off campus stay after suffering a mental breakdown from being forced to preform humiliating acts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective pointed to Tsumiki's profile, which featured a pair of pictures serving as a before and after comparison. The first showed her sulking in front of the bathroom as her old skinny self, and the second was one of her smiling at lunch with Asahina, almost 100 pounds heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The event marked a significant change for her. Not only did her weight rapidly rise from 126 to nearly 220 pounds, but she also became more sociable, quickly making friends with my associate Aoi and later with Sonia Nevermind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped open Asahina and Sonia's profiles. Like with Tsumiki, the before and after pictures made it clear just how much each girl had gained, with Sonia's drastic expansion the most apparent. \"Aoi's gain is what first alerted me to this problem, and it has only grown since then. Her dietary habits have always been deplorable, but her level of exercise managed to negate the effects. That is until she approached me one day to introduce me to her new friend; now she weighs 235 pounds and expends less energy a day than a tortoise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her attention to Sonia's profile. \"As can be plainly seen, Sonia's fattening has been more severe and happened quicker than what befell the others. In a little over a month, she has ballooned from 110 pounds to around 270. I have reason to believe that her rapid gain has something to do with the fact that she is in possession of one of these.\" She pointed to the photo of the Monopig sitting on Sonia's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I remember seeing that when we were viewing Sonia's room.\" Hinata picked it up to get a closer look.\"What is this exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsumiki referred to it as a 'Monopig'. It's appears to be a stuffed toy that speaks if you hit it's stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so special about it?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" The detective's face flushed and she turned away. \"I don't know yet. All I know is that Tsumiki started carrying one around after she began gaining weight, and after shei gave Sonia one as a gift, she also started getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the porcine toys are cursed then!\" Gundam shouted. \"We must destroy them if we hope to save the souls of the princess and our classmate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not cursed, but I do believe they are at least partially responsible for our current predicament.\" Kyoko responded flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what your saying is that Tsumiki is using dolls to make our friends fat?\" Hinata spoke in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it sounds idotic, but there's no other explanation as to how so many of us would let our selves go in such quick succession. Someone is supplying Tsumiki with those dolls, and she in turn is using them to cause herself and others to fill out. As to why, I don't know that yet either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGundam smiled.\"The why is obvious. It is because she is possessed by a daughter of Beelzebub!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko brought her hand to the bridge of her nose.\"...No. She is either doing this of her own free will or being manipulated, likely by the source of the Monopig dolls. It just surprises me that it's her of all people who is so strongly tied to this plot. Tsumiki is known to be of frail mind and body, for her to be attempting this, whether of her own free will or coerced, is evidence of a significant change in her character. She has to know that she would be completely shunned if she was known to be responsible for ruining everyone's girlish figure, what is driving her to be complicit in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn't know what to think. On the one hand, it was obvious that Kirigiri still had a lot of things to look into before any conclusive answers could be drawn. On the other though, he could understand why the detective saw a connection between Tsumiki's recent actions and the sudden expansion of Sonia's waistline. Not only that, but he had also heard that a student named Celeste hadn't been to class in over three weeks; her disappearance could be related to what Kirigiri was looking into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well...\" He picked up Tsumiki's profile and looked at the two photos. Hoping to help the detective out, but not sure how he'd be able to, he randomly took a stab in the dark. \"Tsumiki looks a lot happier in the second picture, maybe she likes being fatter? Or possibly whoever she's working for likes her this way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reserve student hadn't expected anything from his question, but as soon as the words were spoken, Kirigiri's eyes opened wide as a connection in her mind was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course...\" She muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Of course what?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has become clear to me, now. Tsumiki's crimes...\" She pointed her finger at a blank section of wall. \"Are crimes of love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata didn't follow. \"...What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri quickly gathered up her evidence and notes. \"I'm sorry I don't have time to explain further, but I need to follow up on this train of thought while it is fresh in my mind. Can I count on you three to assist me once more evidence has been gathered?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I will gladly lend my unspeakable power to this crusade!\" Gundam interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, sure.\" Hinata rubbed his neck again, still unsure how his offhand suggestion had led to such a huge revelation for the detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't remember agreeing to nothin', but if it means that Sonia will be able to see her feet again I'm in\" Souda gave a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcellent, you will all hear from me shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kirigiri made a mad dash out of the room, moving surprisingly fast for someone her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Three of us?</i> Hinata looked around the room. \"Hey, where did Kuzuryu go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki sat at her usual place in the cafeteria, the gears of her mind grinding as she formed a new plot to fatten the Ultimate Swordsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm... She's really physically active, and she doesn't obsess over a really fattening food like aoi does...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore a solid plan could be formed, an unexpected voice interrupted her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey chubs, I'm talkin' here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Tsumiki turned around to see Kuzuryu staring intently at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, hi. Listen, a little birdy told me that a couple of broads got chunky hanging around you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the Yakuza's face flushed. \"... If you could do it again, I think I could make it worth your while.\"</span></div></div>",

Four things.\"<br>\r\n\"One: It's not a good idea to start yelling when a criminal tries making a deal with you.<br>\r\nTwo: It's painfully obvious that your making these broads fatter on purpose.<br>\r\nThree: Peko has a thing for ice cream, cheese, and spicy ramen, so if you take my offer, you should probably stock up on those foods.<br>\r\nFour: Actions speak louder then words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki didn't understand the last statement that Fuyuhiko had made.<i> \"Wait. Is he saying that he wants me to fatten her up instead of giving verbal conformation that I accept his offer?\"</i> Tsumiki thought.<br>\r\n\"Five: Work on your grammar. I'm pretty sure that \"I'm not scheming anything\" is an improper sentence.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure that it is a p-proper sentance.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nTsumiki had decided to take a more...orderly approach to try and make Peko fat. She had written a letter to the student council that asked if they could start supplying the school store with ice cream and spicy ramen. The student council passed this notion, and three days later, the school store was filled with ice cream and ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeko was happy about the new inventory items. She stocked up on quite a bit of the new goodies. Peko returned to her dorm with practically half of the new items in hand.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nFive days later.<br>\r\n\"Hello there, Ms. Pekoyama. My friends and I are going to go to an ice cream parlor after class today. Would you like to come along?\" Sonia asked innocently.<br>\r\nPeko had gained about 15 pounds. Most of this weight went to her breasts, however, her stomach has started to get a little pudgy as well.<br>\r\n\"Sure. As long as its okay with Fuyuhiko...\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nAfter class.<br>\r\nAoi, Tsumiki, Sonia and Peko walked into a strange restaurant called \"The Dairy Farm\". The place looked like an average restraurant, except for one major thing: the chairs.<br>\r\nThe chairs in this establishment are huge. They are very wide, as if they were made to accommodate people with large buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls took their seats, a waitress approached them. \"Hello. My name is Akira. Our special of the month is called the Wisconsin Experience. Would you like to know more about the special, or would you like to look at our menu's first?\"<br>\r\n\"What's the, uh, Wiszconsihn Experience?\" Peko said as she struggled to pronounce the foreign word their waitress had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, basically, it's one gallon of ice cream, served with cheese curds, both deep fried and regular, a large malt, a medium shake, two bars of milk chocolate, three large slices of cheesecake, a glass of milk, and a gallon of imported Wisconsin custard.\"<br>\r\n\"We'll take four of those.\" Aoi said with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n45 minutes later.<br>\r\n\"Whew. I can't believe that we ate every bite of our meals.\" Peko said.<br>\r\n\"I c-can.\" Tsumiki said as a small smile started to form on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n2 weeks later.<br>\r\nPeko had gained 118 pounds. Most of this weight went to her breasts and stomach, and her breasts were now two giant mounds of flesh that sat on top of her doughy midsection. Peko's face had also gained a little weight, and she now had a pair of pudgy cheeks and a second chin.<br>\r\nKyoko approached Peko as she walked out of the door. \"Hello there, Ms. Peko. I am Kyoko Kirigiri. I was wondering if you can tell me anything about these bizarre stuffed animals?\" Kyoko said as she took one of the Monopig pictures that she had out of her pocket.<br>\r\n\"I've never seen one of those before.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"You heard me. Now, if you'll excuse me...\"<br>\r\nPeko walked off as Kyoko stared at her picture of the Monopig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to the drawing board.\" Kyoko said as she went to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached her room, she noticed that the door was open.<br>\r\n\"That's odd.\" Kyoko said as she went into her room \"I could've sworn that I-\"<br>\r\nKyoko stopped speaking. The sight in front of her was simply too shocking for her. Her room had been ransacked.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n\"You have been doing a much better job than I could have ever hoped for, Tsumiki.\" Junko said as she put glasses on. \"Not only did you manage to make Peko much larger, but you also managed to acquire all of the evidence that Kyoko had on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki was being wrapped with measuring tape in the corner. \"E-ehh, it was nothing........\"<br>\r\n\"My my. Aren't you the humble one?\" Junko said as she kept her glasses on her face.<br>\r\n\"You will get your reward as soon as I can figure out your new measurements. Now, onto our next order of buisness. The reward that you shall receive for completing your next assignment shall be a-\"<br>\r\n\"U-uhm, shouldn't we postpone my next assignment? I mean, Kyoko is onto us.

Everything from the sheets to the dozen different pillows were made of the finest black and white silk, an aesthetic choice Junko insisted looked good on anything. Nestled in perfect comfort with her face resting between her lover's bosoms, the nurse couldn't help but sleep like a rock these days; which gave the mastermind the opportunity to continue her work without disturbing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Monopig hopped onto the bed and held a smartphone up to Junko's ear. After a few seconds of ringing, a stern voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya, Sis!\" Junko adopted a rather preppy attitude. \"How goes killin' the terrorists?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Enoshima.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one and only!\" The Monopig put a crown on her head. \"Now listen up, dear sister.My master plan is exceeding even my expectations.

I was merely having another one of my quirky moments.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid lower and gave Tsumiki a kiss on the forehead, before wrapping her arms round her stomach. \"Please, return to your slumber, you have much work ahead of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the answer, the nurse quickly fell a sleep once more; where she was blessed with lovely dreams in which the comfort and affection she now knew lasted forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayaka Maizono stood on the kabuki theater stage located on the top floor of the school. Before her were two dozen or so students that had been lucky enough to score tickets to one of her pop group's live practice sessions.\"Thank you! Thank you everyone! I hope you enjoyed the show!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the assembled students applauded the presentation, a few even called for an encore. With their thanks at their back, the pop group gave one last wave before they headed offstage to the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, Yuki. Your harmonization was off again!\" One of the girls cursed as she shoved her dance shoes into a locker. \"We practically have to give these live practice tickets away now if we want anyone other than that creep Komaeda to show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to hell, Agi!\" A petit girl in glasses called as she removed her dress. \"Maybe if you actually studied the lyrics to the songs I wrote instead of improvising whatever dropped into your head first, I wouldn't have a problem keeping up with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you please calm down!\" Sayaka pleaded. \"It doesn't matter if we make a few mistakes while we're practicing, we just need to recognize those mistakes and fine tune our performance for when the real deal happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgi sighed as she threw on a t-shirt. \"Man, its not just that. Even our best performances can't fill all of the seats any more... We need to add something new I think. Something big that's sure to catch everyone's eyes again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\" Yuki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. You two are the brains remember? I'm just here to wow everyone with how hot I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki slapped her forehead, leaving indents of the nose guard of her classes on her face. \"You're so immodest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayaka walked away, leaving her band mates to continue squabbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Something big... but what?</i> She mused to herself as she passed through the back door of the stage, unaware that a figure in the shadows had been eavesdropping on their little fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehehe...\" Tsumiki giggled once she was out of hearing range. \"Need something big? Well I think I just had my biggest idea yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Tsumiki contacted the school newspaper to arrange an interview. She invited Sonia and Aoi to sit in with her, as well as an anonymous note to Celeste to come in and speak after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, hello girls.\" A professionally dressed senior class student invited them into the conference room. \"My name is Sosu Yamato, chair of the school newspaper and a member of the student council. It's become apparent to quite a few students that girls like yourselves have really started to let themselves go recently, care to comment as to why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia spoke first. \"Well you see  Miss Yamato, I've actually thought about becoming heavier for a few years now. Before I found it hard because I could never stomach the amount of food I needed to achieve that goal, but I guess one day my appetite just crept up on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSosu stared at her in disbelief. \"Hold on, you're actually saying that you wanted to be fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I'm just so soft now.\" She pressed her hands into her hips to emphasize this. \"I've always been afraid that I might intimidate people on accident, but now my appearance is so disarming people can't help but feel at ease around me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's certainly one way to put it.\" She turned her attention to Asahina. \"What about you Aoi? Surely your sudden weight gain has impacted your very athletic lifestyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you got me there. I haven't hit the gym in weeks.\" She glanced upwards in thought. \"Or has it been over a month now? Anyway, I just realized that I liked hanging out with my friends and eating donuts more than I did training. My routine hardly left me any time to do anything fun, but now I can have fun all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached her arms around the chairs and gave Tsumiki and Sonia a side hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How very optimistic of you.\" She turned to Tsumiki. \"And last but not least we have you. Three months ago you were known as a neurotic mess a favorite target of bullies- and now you're hanging out with one of the most popular girls in school on a regular basis. How do you explain this sudden turn of events?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well.\" Tsumiki blushed. \"You could say that I had a revelation, of sorts... I spent all of my time worrying about how I appeared to people. I would do anything to please them, knowing that most of them would still hate me anyways. Then one day, while I was recovering from the latest bout of humiliation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki paused, trying to find the right way to phrase it while still being vague. \"I realized that I didn't need to tear myself down to appease others, I just needed to be myself and enjoy the company of those who accepted me as I wanted to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSosu smiled a bit. \"Well, call me impressed. I never thought that letting yourself go could have such positive outcomes. I'm sure the whole school will want to hear about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki smiled as she and her friends shook hands with the newslady, before exiting the room and heading to the cafeteria for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I-I can't wait until Junko hears about this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe campus police were lined up in front of Kirigiri's room. One officer was in the process of searching the room for evidence, while another questioned the detective about the break in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you say it had to have happened between the hours of 14:00 and 15:30?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes. \"Yes. I have explained this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the only thing they stole-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was my latest case file.\" She said curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Settle down, miss. We'll follow up on this as soon as we're done investigating the crime scene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri spotted Naegi standing just behind the police tape. Without saying goodbye to the officers, she stormed over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" He noticed how furious she was. \"E-everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now do you see that my case isn't a laughing matter?\" She pointed at her room. \"Someone broke in and stole my evidence, they know I'm a threat to their plan and tried to take me out of the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah, that seems to be the case.\" Naegi nodded. \"It's just hard to believe that all of this would happen over a few of us getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is stupid, yes. But that doesn't negate the gravity of the situation. There were only four people whom I revealed my evidence to, one of them must have sold me out to Tsumiki or the force behind her. I need your help to figure out who it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah sure, no problem.\" Naegi readily agreed, feeling guilty that he hadn't offered to help her earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now follow me, I happen to know where all of them would be at this hour.\"</span></div></div>",

Kyoko, didn't you say that you told four people?\"<br>\r\nKyoko looked at the three suspects and narrowed her eyes. \"Where is Fuyuhiko?\" Kyoko asked.<br>\r\n\"I heard that he was out on a date with Peko.\" Souda said.<br>\r\n\"I see..... Thank you for your cooperation. Naegi, get some rest. We have a criminal to interregat tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay. So, who wants to play against me?\" Naegi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko sighed. Her attempts to try and interrogate Fuyuhiko were unfruitful. He spent all of his time with her now, and she couldn't question him while she was with him. There's no way he would confess to his crimes while she's near by.<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, Tsumiki had struck again. Sayaka and her musical group had all gained weight. Sayaka gained at least 128 pounds. Her face had grown a little pudgier. Her breasts had gained six inches. Her stomach had become very large, and it was now divided into two, flabby sections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips and buttocks had gained the most weight. Her butt was now a giant, flabby mass of cellulite that was so big that the school board had no choice but to make a new desk for her, as she simply didn't fit into her old one anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to make things worse,\" Kyoko said with disgust. \"Naegi is spending all of his time playing cards with Hinata instead of spending time with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n\"So, how did you like your reward?\" Junko asked with a cute expression plastered on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki had no awnser to Junko's question. All she could do pant with her tongue hanging out of her pudgy, blushing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if you finish your next assignment, you get three pieces of my underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your target is Ibuki.\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n\"Number 86 attacks Grapha, and I believe that makes it game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curses!\" Gundam said.</span></div></div>",

As the song reached it's chorus, the rocker couldn't help but blurt the lyrics out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"California! Uber Alles! California Uuu-ber Alles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ibuki, you need to be more aware of your surroundings. There are classes going on right now.\" A heavyset boy in a white suit spoke, effortlessly able to keep up with the rocker's stride despite his mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Cali-fornia!\" Ibuki shouted out one last time before she turned the volume down on on her phone. \"Relax, Byakuya. Ibuki is just trying to get her rhythm moving so she'll be be able to crush Sayaka in the upcoming School Wide Music Wars! May the loudest sound win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph, One shouldn't spice the appetizers if they're planning to follow it with a fireball of a main course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Ibuki didn't get the metaphor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm saying is, the other students might not appreciate your talent as much when you're preforming if you first use it to prevent them from finishing a test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'oh!\" She planted her palm directly against her forehead. \"Ibuki hadn't considered that! This is why she leaves funding and management decisions to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and adjusted his glasses. \"As long as you entrust yourself to a member of the Togami Conglomerate, your potential is endless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what she likes to hear!\" She cheered as they reached the school commons on the first floor. \"Now then, where would be the best place to flood our fellow students with advertising!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogami suddenly stopped in his tracks. \"It looks like someone already beat us here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ibuki refocused on her surroundings. Across the three walls of the commons area were three huge banners stretching from corner to corner. Each one was dedicated to Maizono's pop group, who now all seemed to be quite chubby if the pictures of them were to be believed. Sayaka, standing at the center of the group, looked to be the heaviest of all; her wide hips and butt demanding extra space for their owner. To her right was Agi, who looked to be the second heaviest if her exaggerated hourglass figure was any indication. On the left stood Yuki, who's belly was clearly the center of attention. It had grown to the point where her belly button and love handles were clearly visible against the strained fabric of her uniform. Behind them were the two less known members of the group, who had also pudged up a considerable amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ibuki can't believe it! The way she looks sometimes!\" The rocker often unconsciously thought and spoke in song lyrics. \"When did Sayaka's group turn into such pigs?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that they've been caught up in the newest sensation sweeping the school.\" Togami retrieved a newspaper from an interior jacket pocket. \"Two weeks ago, the testimony of princess Sonia and her two associates sparked a sudden anti-dieting fad amongst the female members of the student body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let Ibuki see!\" She snatched the newspaper from him. She read through the interviews given by Sonia, Aoi, and Tsumiki, as well as the later testimonial given by Celeste. \"...Great Giant Tropican Spiders! It's true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed the paper shut and glared at the three banners. \"Ibuki's rivals have clearly issued her a challenge! She must step up to the plate if her honor is remain intact!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rocker turned to Togami. \"Mr. Pigfeet, please teach Ibuki the joys of food so she can crush her opponents both metaphorically and physically!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe adjusted his glasses again. \"I'd be delighted, but even with my vast knowledge of our world's cuisine, you wouldn't be able to match the weights that Maizono's group have achieved in the month we have before the competition. I have a connoisseur's mind you see, to beat Sayaka you'll need the mind of a true glutton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely there is someone out there who can help Ibuki in her time of great need!\" She fell to her knees and pleaded dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogami put a hand on her shoulder a few moments later. \"No need to worry. I know the perfect person for the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki, Aoi, and Sonia sat at their usual lunch table. Asahina was currently in the middle excitedly retelling a bit of gossip she just heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I heard the greatest story ever from Junpei just now! He said that while he was working for Celeste, he found a certain notebook written by the chief cosplayer herself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia clapped. \"Oooh! What did it say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It turns out...\" Aoi paused for dramatic effect. \"That Celeste secretly writes sappy vampire love stories!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki and Sonia both started laughing uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did- did she find out about it?\" The nurse managed to say between chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did! And guess what? She wasn't even mad about it! In fact, the very next thing she did was request that they roleplay as the main characters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knockout delivered, the group wasn't able to do much of anything but laugh for the next few minutes. Eventually though, their revelry was interrupted by a pair of figures walking through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, Togami's dressed as Mobster Kingpin again!\" Aoi waved at the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take offense to that. Mobster Kingpin's entire body mass is only composed of 2% fat. I would never emaciate myself so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scratched her head. \"What? That can't be right. I mean, dude has a neck roll and is built like a sumo wrestler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough talk of copyrighted super villians!\" Ibuki rushed over to Tsumiki and put her foot on the table next to her. \"You there! Ibuki's manager tells her that you're the one she needs to talk to so she can get big enough to crush her rivals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sweat drop formed on the back of Tsumiki's head and she looked down slightly.<i>...I-I really have a reputation for this now, don't I?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly snapped back to reality. \"W-well, it's not that hard. You just need to eat a lot of sweets, breads, and fried foods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And donuts are all of those things!\" Aoi happily added as she bit into one of her baked wheels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia nodded. \"It helps if you eat socially too. I know, we should take her out with us when we go get dinner in Shinjuku tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahina pumped her chubby arms. \"Yeah! The more the merrier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ibuki accepts your invitation gladly! Where shall we eat tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they discussed several potential locations, the somewhat small form of Makoto Naegi walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey everyone.\" His sight quickly focused in on Togami, who looked somehow different than he was used to seeing him. <i>Huh, since when does Byakuya where all white?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi!\" Aoi got up from the table and gave him a huge hug, which wound up smothering the poor boy due to the height difference. \"Man I haven't seen you in forever! what have you been up to all this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to get her to loosen her grip enough for him to breath. \"Oh, you know... studying for cram school, mostly. It got so bad that Kirigiri just kicked me out of my room and told me to go treat myself for once. I think she said something about you guy's knowing a good ice cream place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Dairy Farm!\" Sonia's eyes brightened. \"We haven't been there in a few weeks; Oh, we should invite Peko if we decide to go there before dinner, she seemed to really enjoy herself there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swimmer finally released Naegi. \"I'm down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure, sounds great.\" Tsumiki nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki, Asahina, Sonia, Ibuki, Peko, and Naegi all departed from the academy together at around four in the afternoon. Togami had declined their offer, citing that anything from such a backwoods place as Wisconsin would surely upset his stomach. Instead he offered to use the time they were out to procure desserts and other fatty foods in bulk so that Ibuki would be able to start her new training regime the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff of a balcony on the second floor of the school, Kyoko watched as the shuttle bus carrying Naegi and the others rolled out of the academy's front parkway and on to the main road into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good work, Makoto.</i> She took a sip from a large mug of coffee, only to realize that it was completely empty. Dissatisfied, she placed it on the cafe table she was currently sitting at, next to the three other cups she had already finished. She then reached into her jacket and left money for her orders on the table, before rushing over to the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata and Kuzuryu were walking down the hall to their usual game room, the yakuza was currently resting both of his hands in his pinstripe jacket pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you decided to show up again.\" Hinata spoke in an attempt to break the awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feh, don't act like I haven't seen you in weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reserve student scratched his head. \"...You haven't though. You've done nothing but hang out with Peko since she...\" He paused, trying to find the best way to put it. \"started to fill out her skirt more\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Hinata's surprise, the mobster didn't get mad at all, and instead started smiling as his face flushed. \"Heh, you've got me there, pal. There's just something about a broad that can eat you out of house and home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny that you would mention that.\" A stern voice echoed through the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys turned around and saw a rather angry looking Kirigiri approaching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw hell, it's the fuzz.\" Kuzuryu cracked his neck. \"The fuck do you want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You broke into my room and stole my evidence, didn't you?\" She glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled smugly. \"What if I did? Campus police can't prove it, far as the law's concerned it never happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh boy...</i> Hinata began to back away from the two of them. <i>This won't end well...</i></span></div></div>",

It came to a stop at the front entrance, and a dark figure in a kevlar vest exited from the right passenger side before approaching the school. Using an electronic ID, she was able to let herself in and proceeded to walk over to the first floor cafeteria. She casually brushed the double doors aside as she made her way to the kitchen in the back, then approached a hidden panel on the far wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed the panel open with the bottom of her closed fist. \"I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- \"Who's here?\" A synthesized voiced replied. It's cattiness obvious even while disguised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brow furrowed. \"Who else could it possibly be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- \"Uh, let's see... the pizza guy, an escort, the police, Statsi... there are a lot of different kinds of people who might want to see me, so I'm going to have to ask that you be a bit more specific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned away from the monitor and began walking back the way she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- \"Fuck, Mukuro!

The door swung open as she arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier looked around at the incredibly decadent decor. \"Gaudy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love ya too, Sis. I don't see you making any headway in the interior design department.\" Junko was currently sitting at a small dining table covered with a long black and white table cloth that had been set up parallel to her wall of computer monitors. \"So, how's flying coach these days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Survivable, provided one is still able to fit in the seats they provide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko grinned, her facial muscles flaring her puffy cheeks further. \"You do have a sense of humor! I'm so proud of you! No points for originality though, I know you're jealous of the f.i.n.e. fine body I got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave her stomach a slap, sending waves rippling throughout her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMukuro glared. \"Please don't tell me you called me all the way from Beirut just to gloat about how fat you've gotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck no!

You're here because I gots a problem that requires your... expertise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, you want me to chase one of our classmates off of your trail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko put her glasses on. \"Precisely.

Therefore, I request that you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mastermind paused suddenly, before letting out a low moan and laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier rolled her eyes, before reaching under the tablecloth and forcefully pulling its contents outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah!\" Tsumiki screamed as she was yanked out from under the table, a thin layer of saliva and vaginal fluids coating her mouth and chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko looked over Mukuro, gleefully taking in the rage and indignation on her face. \"Well, now before you ask...I did in fact have sexual relations with that woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While we were talking?!\" Mukuro fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the glasses off. \"Hey, I didn't think I'd finish that quickly. What can I say? My girl Tsumiki knows her stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse's face flushed at the compliment. She wiped her mouth off using a towel that was laid out on the nearby sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMukuro shook her head. \"...Unbelievable. And yet, it seems so fitting for someone as twisted as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mastermind struck a cute pose. \"Oh, but a complete disregard for society and social norms is what makes me so cute and lovable! And if I'm this much fun, who knows what lies beneath that cold as ice exterior of your's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier's anger was instantly drowned out by a quick flash of horror. She trembled momentarily, but quickly regained her composure as she balled her fists at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki placed the crown on top of Junko's head. \"Ah, yes! Back to the matter at hand! While my consort continues furthering my goals, you will lead the interloper astray; distracting her until it is too late for my master plan to be derailed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you expect me to accomplish this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in good time dear sister! First, you must tell me: What size skirt do you wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane Owari stood in the boxing ring at the school's gymnasium. She was currently facing off against a rather nervous Hinata, who was doing his best to guard his face as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Hinata. You gotta at least try to smack me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owari, when you invited me to come train with you, I didn't think we would be trying to knock each other's lights out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, you didn't?\" The gymnast scratched her head through a large red glove. \"Well... tough. Tell ya what, if you can punch me square in the jaw at least once, I'll let you cop a feel of these...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe accentuated her impressive cleavage, causing the reserve student to blush slightly and turn his attention away nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aw, hell... they're so big she could probably kill me with them if she wanted to.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon... I'm wide open!\" She lowered her guard and exposed her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Hinata slowly brought his arms out of his defensive stance and prepared to take a swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too slow!\" Owari delivered a punch right into Hinata's stomach, causing him to collapse to the ground in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwari joined him on the ground and began counting, slamming the mat as each number was said. \"One! Two! Three! And it's over! I am once again the heavyweight boxing champion of the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A-aaaaah....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout fifteen minutes later, the two students sat together on a bench in the corner of the gym. Owari had poorly wrapped bandages around Hinata's torso, being rather unversed in first aid. Sore and unable to bend at the waist, the reserve student watched as the gymnast dug her teeth into a comically sized meat on a bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Owari, are you sure you should be eating that much meat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" She spoke with a mouthful. \"Watcha mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" He thought of the best way to phrase it. \"Have you noticed that a lot of our classmates have started getting... larger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gymnast gave the question a fair amount of thought as she finished chewing.  \"Hmm... now that you mention it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed a fist into her palm in revelation. \"Yeah! Like, half of our friends are total fatasses now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata hung his head.<i>... Blunt as always, I see...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recovered his wits a few moments later. \"...Right. So don't you think you should maybe cut back on how much you eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwari scratched her head again. \"What? you worried about me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er-\" Hinata looked away. \"I just- you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAw relax, I'm just givin' you a hard time.\" She slammed a hand on his shoulder, causing him to yelp in pain again. \"You don't gotta worry about me though, I'm not about to just lay around doin' nothing because some newspaper says it's cool now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile slowly crept over Hinata's face. \"That's good to hear.\" He glanced over at the clock. \"Oh, we should probably get going, we're going to be late for class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed her arms. \"Only if you help me study again, those phil tests kick my ass every time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwari and Hinata were walking through the main hallway in between second floor classes. Hinata was attempting to integrate basic philosophical concepts into the gymnast's brain, though they had about as much chance of sticking there as a 10 day old postit note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay, can you describe Jeremy Bentham's Hedonistic Calculus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... He's that English guy that said you should let a train run over a baby if it means that you can save five other people right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, that is right-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Owari pumped her arms. \"I am so going to ace this test!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But it doesn't really answer what I asked you...\" Hinata mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued onward, a large picture of a dinner table covered in a lavish multi-coursed meal that had been pinned to a bulletin board caught Owari's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" She drooled slightly. \"I gotta get me some of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of what?\" Hinata looked up from the textbook he was reading out of and saw the picture. <i>Oh look, more food... I'm kind of surprised the school doesn't go bankrupt with how much some people have been eating lately.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata stepped up to the board and read the description under the picture out loud. \"Before the battle of the bands takes place next week, treat yourself this weekend during the lovely new Queen's Feast event. All of our female students are invited to an evening of socializing and light competition. The winner will receive four tickets to an all expense paid trip to the Hitomi Hot Springs resort in Tohoku... Invitations available on request. Please contact Tsumiki Mikan for more information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell yes!\" Owari smirked. \"Spa vacations are the best! I've needed to have my back worked on for awhile now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm... that does sound nice, but it doesn't even say what you have to do to win the tickets...and it's hosted by Tsumiki...</i> A feeling of dread suddenly washed over Hinata. \"...It's an eating contest, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is?\" Owari looked upwards in thought. \"Well shit, guess I better get that invite and start practicing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, Owari broke out into a full sprint towards the staircase that led up to the dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-wari!\" Hinata called out as he tried to run after her. \"Come back! I don't think you've fully thought this through..... And we're going to miss a test!\"</span></div></div>",

She ran all the way to the cafeteria, and was standing in line to get some food for her \"training\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owari...*pant* *pant* I really don't....*wheeze* think that you should *cough* enter the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy! It's my turn!\" Owari said. She walked ahead to get some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wow. She didn't even notice that I'm here. She must really be determined.\"</i> Hinata thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwari grabbed an extra large tray. She then proceeded to fill the tray with as much food as she could find.<br>\r\n\"Argh... Owari, I really think that your making a huge mistake\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph?\" Owari murmured as she filled her face with food. She wasn't paying attention to Hinatas warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I mean, I really think that if you go through with this, you'll become fat like.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata stopped as he watched Owari shovel her food down her throat, piece by piece. Something about the way she chewed and swallowed her food made Hinata.........HORNY.<br>\r\n\"Um, Owari, you don't mind if I get you some more food, do you?<br>\r\n\"Not at all!\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nTwo hours later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man. Who would've thought that Owari could eat THAT much food in one day.\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata walked into his room, and inside, he found a pair of fat, fleshy women waiting for him.<br>\r\nThey were Tsumiki and Junko, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya, Hinata! Fatten up any women lately?\" Junko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, um, your Junko, right?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\"<br>\r\n\"And your known as the, um, Ultimate Fashonista, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course! Can't you tell by my lovely curves?<br>\r\nHinata looked at Junko with astonishment. Her body was big. Her stomach was composed of three doughy, soft rolls that draped past her knees. Her arms were flabby, and covered with fat. Her legs and hips were lined with celluite. Her breast looked like they were two giant beach balls. Her face had three chins, and she had \"chipmunk cheeks\".<br>\r\n\"<b>She doesn't look like she's ever been thin</b>\" Hinata thought to himself.<br>\r\n<i>\"And yet somehow, she's still not as fat as Sonia.</i><br>\r\n\"Um, how did you get into my room?\"<br>\r\n\"Th-that's not important!\" Tsumiki said.<br>\r\n\"Um, it kind of is....\"<br>\r\n\"I saw you in the cafeteria today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't try to deny it. I saw you fattening up Owari like she was a little piggy.\" Junko said as she made a cute face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your style. I want you to help me with my little plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata swallowed heavily. \"Wh-what makes you think that I would help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you want. And I can give it to you. I can make your dark little desire a reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh....what desire?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on! Don't play dumb! I know you want to have a harem of women adore you. Love you. Kiss you. Marry you......\" Junko said as she took a bizarre pose.<br>\r\n\"I can satisfy your little wish.

Why are you suddenly talking like you're an entirely different person?\" Hinata turned his head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence! This is merely one of my several personas I take on as the mood strikes me! I like to experiment to see which has the greatest effect in any given situation or interaction-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For example.\" Junko slid the crown into her hand and placed on her glasses. \"I have found that my dear Tsumiki here tends to react the most positively when I speak very formally, but with an inflection of calm intellectualism that is both reassuring and at the same time subtly domineering. Isn't that right, love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki smiled and nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled lightly. \"You see, in my line of work, it pays to be able to be many different things for different kinds of people-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaand to top it all off its such an interesting character trait that the audience can't help but love me~\" Junko suddenly dropped both accessories and adopted her kawaii pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was completely lost now. \"...Audience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko stuck her tongue out. \"Yeah, the audience of the goddamn world! If ya want to make it big you either give the world what it wants or you tell it what it wants! Do you hear me, you little herbivore bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I do eat meat sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not what that means.\" Junko returned to her \"default\" stance. \"But we'll work on your lingo later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reserve student sighed.<i>...What have I gotten myself into?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Can you please just tell me what you need me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! You're part of Kirigiri's clique right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.... I'm not sure that's the right word for it, but she does tolerate me, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Then what I need you to do is to feed me all the information you can get out of her regarding her plan to get in the way of my plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata swallowed hard. \"So you want me to spy on her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glasses slid on. \"Correct. As she suspects nothing of you and is desperate for help she can trust right now, I imagine you'll have an easy time getting her to talk freely of her plans. In addition to your role as my mole, you will also aid my elder sister in falling for my distraction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What distraction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue from a stage direction, Hinata's closet suddenly opened up, and a somewhat familiar figure emerged. She was dressed to look just like Junko, the only difference being the lack of an extra 150+ pounds of blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our detective friend is digging around for a mastermind behind my dear Tsumiki's campaign to expand the horizons of our fellow classmates. So, I will set the stage for her to be \"convinced\" that Mukuro, posing as me, is actually me. This will cause her to expend all her energy chasing down the me she thinks is me instead of putting more pressure on Tsumiki to find the me that's actually me. Do you get me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" The crown came on again. \"As I am a firm believer in instant gratification, I will assign Tsumiki to help you ensure that your beloved blossoms into a real woman! She has a long way to go if you expect her to emerge victorious during the Queen's feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Owari being able to out eat even the largest of the school's students sent a shiver of excitement up his spine. \"Y-yeah, sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wunderbar! You are dismissed for now then!\" Junko waved her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blinked twice. \"...But this is my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly became sad. \"Oh dear, you are right... how insensitive of me... and on my first day as your boss too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeary eyed, the mastermind led her two subordinates out of the room. Mukuro closed the door as she exited. Hinata just stared at the spot where he last saw them for several minutes, still not completely sure if what he saw and heard just now was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I...What even is she?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Hinata found himself sitting in the cafeteria, waiting for Owari to join him as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wassup?\" A familiar yet crude voice called to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Owari, how's it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish talking, Owari slammed a foodtray stacked with two tottering towers of extra crispy bacon down at the seat across from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check it out! The caf lady made a fuckton of bacon today! So I thought: 'hey, if I'm gonna win those spa tickets, I might as well warm up with some good old fashioned meat!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh dear lord! My arteries are clogging just looking at all of it...</i> \"...You sure you can eat that much bacon in one sitting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! I got it cleared with the school nurse and everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nurse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm. I approved her request to add a bit more protein into her diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata turned his head to see a smiling Tsumiki approaching them. She was accompanied by a rather portly tan skinned girl who was currently enjoying a rather large maple bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks again for that! Didn't want the coach lookin' at me funny if he saw how much effort I'm putting into my new training regime!\" She gave the nurse a playful jab to the shoulder, which caused her to squeak slightly and immediately treat it like she had been wounded in battle. After carefully bandaging herself, Tsumiki decided to sit next to Hinata, while Asahina took a seat alongside Owari. As both girls dug into their version of the most important meal of the day, Hinata couldn't help but to gaze mouth agape at how quickly and mindlessly they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow... You know, they really look similar. I'm kind of surprised they aren't related... </i> Hinata smiled blankly. <i>Heh, the only difference between the two of them is their weight...Now that I think about it, I really wouldn't mind if the difference in size between the two of them was a bit... less noticeable.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's thoughts trailed off, until he was completely focused on watching Owari eat. Strip by strip, the fatty pig bites were dropped into the gymnasts waiting mouth. With each bite, Hinata could see her signature white buttoned up shirt get just a little bit tighter. Slowly, the beginnings of a muffin top formed and continued to grow wider as the shirt began to ride up. First one love handle formed, then two, then three. By then, her belly had grown to the point that the fabric was being torn at the seams, and the buttons had been pulled as tightly as they could possibly be. Her already colossal breasts were also beginning to swell with fat, to the point that each one was bigger than both of His fists put together. Her thighs, hips, and ass had all widened to the point that her skirt had ripped open and was now lying limp on the seat below her. It was at this time that Hinata's mind chose to remind him of the story Owari once told him about how she used to wait tables without wearing any underwear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwari downed the last of her bacon, wiping her mouth off with the back of her hand. \"Man, that was good! Hey 'Nata, can ya get something to drink? I think I may have overdid it a bit with the bacon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gymnast looked over to her associate's seat. Hinata was currently smiling widely, a tiny stream of drool coming out of the corner of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hinata. You okay?\" She took a closer look at him. It was obvious that his face was flushed, and upon closer inspection his hands appeared to be shaking slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crap, he's wiggin' out. I better go carry him to the nurse's office again.</i> Owari attempted to stand up, but found it to be very difficult with her currently heavily bloated middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking hell, I ate so much I can't stand up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden yell was enough to break Aoi away from her donut feast. \"Hmm? Aw, damn. I hate when that happens. Not really much you can do except wait for your stomach to do what it does best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um, I actually know something that really helps when you're bloated like that...\" Tsumiki spoke, a knowing smile forming on her face. \"If someone rubs your belly for you, you'll feel a lot better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwari scratched her head.\"Huh... I hadn't thought about that. Hey Hinata, I need you to come over here and rub my belly for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart skipped a beat as his mind chose the perfect time to rejoin reality. \"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said come over here and rub my stomach for me.\" She pointed at her distended middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nervous nod, Hinata made his way over to her side of the table, sat in between her and Aoi, and wrapped an arm around her. At first he was rather nervous to be actually touching Owari in a way that didn't involve a full contact sport, but as it became clear that she didn't mind his presence, he began really getting to work, gently pressing into her still largely flat stomach and moving her hand in a clockwise fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh...\" Owari closed her eyes as she felt his hand gently caressing her. \"Oh man, you were right Tsumiki! This feel's great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse feigned innocence.\"I told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahina stood up. \"Whelp, I know when three becomes a crowd. C'mon, Tsumiki, we should leave these two alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" Tsumiki gathered her things and stood up from the table, shooting Hinata a wink as she and Asahina headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Well, I guess I know who I'm in bed with now... metaphorically speaking.</i> He turned his attention back to Owari's bloated stomach. <i>... But I can worry about the consequences of my actions later...</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Owari had filled out quite nicely because of her training. Her stomach was now divided into three huge rolls, and her breasts were almost as large as her stomach was. Her rear had become a bit chunkier, as did her face, but most of the weight went to her breasts and butt.<br>\r\n\"Um, yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Why are you helping me?\" Owari asked with a hint of accusation.<br>\r\n\"Uh.......Because I'm a nice guy?\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n\"Is that a question?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh......No?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I only ask because the look on your face becomes pretty strange whenever you look at me...\"<br>\r\nHinatas eyes widened. <i>\"Crap.

First Kuzuryu had gone into hiding after she failed to interrogate him, and now this \"Enoshima\" character suddenly shows up to class after months of absence and raids her evidence further. Thanks to their interference, Kyoko was essentially back to square one of her investigation; while at the same time Tsumiki continued to expand more and more of her classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced over to where Asahina sat, noticing how the small half-desk was pressed tightly against her fat stomach. She just couldn't understand why her friend did nothing to try and get back to her old athletic build. It was more than her just being oblivious to what was going on, it was as if she didn't care about swimming at all anymore and dedicated all of her time to stuffing her face. The detective had wanted to bring the matter up with her, but Aoi was one of the few friends that she actually had, and didn't want to risk upsetting her needlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill though, she needed to act quickly. The fatter the school got, the more influence Tsumiki seemed to gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell at the end of class rang, and the detective watched as her classmates filed out of the room. She noted that Naegi had left in kind of a hurry, which concerned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Something must be wrong.</i> She stood up from her seat immediately and made her way past the exiting crowd as quickly as possible. As she passed into the main hallway, she saw the Ultimate Lucky Student leaning against the wall near the bathrooms; an energetic Asahina chatting away at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Naegi, are you as hyped for this weekend as I am?\" The swimmer cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well... at the very least it'll be cool to see everyone at a formal event.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on! You aren't excited about all the free food that's gonna be there? Tsumiki gave me a peak at everything they're serving up, and I'm telling you its like walking right into heaven! I am so gonna eat till I explode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't. I rather prefer your internal organs stay intact.\" The Detective murmured as she approached them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi tensed up a bit as he heard her voice. \"O-oh, hey Kirigiri... How's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrible. My entire case has been reduced to nothing more than theories. But that's not why I'm here. I noticed that you seemed anxious about something, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi, you've never been able to lie to anyone and you haven't developed the ability to do so since last we talked.\" She closed her eyes in thought. \"Please, I'm only concerned about your well being and wish to help in any way I can.\" She opened her eyes again. \"So kindly tell me what is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective's words died in her mouth as she spotted Naegi reflexively grabbing Aoi's hand for support. Her eyes grew wide with horror and she stumbled back a step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" She blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Asahina looked to the ground sheepishly. \"Well, you see... Last week I was walking back from the cafeteria, and I heard some of the other students whispering that Naegi had a crush on me. At first I was like 'psssh, there's no way that's true', but since it was just mostly him and me last week, we had a lot of time to talk... and one thing led to another, and I wound up asking if he liked me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri turned away from them. \"I've heard enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi grew apprehensive.\"Sheesh, Kirigiri. I know it happened kind of sudden, but could you not seem so upset with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not upset. I'm very glad that the two of you could find happiness together.\" Despite her words, it was very obvious to other two that she was very emotional right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-kay. If you say so...\" Asahina scratched her head, trying to think of something to say that might cheer her up. \"Um... Ah, I know! I got some extra invitations from Tsumiki for the Queen's Feast. If you wanna come, we'd have a better chance of winning the big prize at the end!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective glared at the formally designed flier offered to her. After spending several moments letting her emotions stew, she eventually took the invitation and shoved it into a back pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... yeah. See you there?\" Naegi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri wasn't able to respond, she merely stared blankly at them until Aoi hastily shouted an excuse and dragged Naegi away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...What is wrong with me?</i> She cried internally as her hands trembled. <i>Why do I feel so much contempt for them right now?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, its so cute whenever the odd ones of the class get together!\" A haughty voice rang out, causing the bubbling despair in Kyoko's chest to boil over into rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They really are perfect for each other, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun around to the source of the voice. Before her was the lithe valley girl sounding creature she had come to know as the Ultimate Fashionista. \"Enoshima! You did this, didn't you? What have you done to them?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe decoy laughed. \"Like, what do you want me to say? The chemistry was totally there, it just needed a little outside spark to get it going. Maybe you'd have seen it too if you weren't busy digging around in other people's business all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Kirigiri had never been filled with such hatred for someone before. It took every reserve of her normally ironclad willpower to not punch her right then and there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMukuro smirked. \"Besides, why are you mad at me? I'm not the one who stole your boyfriend right from under your nose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is not my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, sure. Listen, there's still time to save your feelings if you like, really impress him. Though there's no way he'll be yours if you keep pushing people away to look into why a few girls can't seem to stay the same pants size for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe decoy began to walk away. \"I'll leave you to ponder my advice for a bit. bye bye now, don't be a stranger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective ground her teeth as she watched her leave. <i>She's just trying to goad me into doing something stupid...She's just trying to goad me into doing something stupid!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lashed out, slamming a gloved fist into the nearest locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But she's right, isn't she?</i> Tears began to form at the base of her eyes. <i>I've been ignoring my friends for too long, and this is the result... I...I'm not sure what the right thing to do is anymore...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective wandered off back to her room, where after securing the electronic lock, broke down and let her emotions fully overtake her.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki smiled to herself as she marveled at how all of her hard work this week had come together. She was currently wearing a flowing white cocktail dress and her hair had been smoothed out so that the individual strands of her ribbon-like hair were of equal length. Her bulging breasts and stomach were very much visible under the tightly pulled fabric, but she had long grown accustomed to nothing fitting loosely anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced around the gym, the walls of which had been covered with an easily applied wallpaper that gave off the impression that they were in a fancy western style ballroom. Several brass chandeliers hung from the ceiling and provided enough candle light to make things seem elegant while also remain visible. On the red carpeted ground, a dozen huge round wooden tables had been set up and covered in a fine table cloth each. At the far end of the wall was a portable stage on which classical instruments sat. In the very center of the room sat a large chocolate fountain that guests would have full access to throughout the night, and through the side exit people could enter into the garden to cool off and make conversation in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove all though, the main attraction was the two long lines of tables running against the parallel walls that were covered in as much food as Tsumiki could call in. The catering had been the combined effort of Hanamura, freshly returned from the hospital, Togami, who provided the more exotic and refined dishes, and of course, Tsumiki's favorite person in the world, Junko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse stepped up to the buffet line and casually sampled a biscuit from the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, my love. If only you could see all of this in person...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata sat at the foot of Owari's bed, a black waistcoat wrapped over his usual plain white shirt. Tonight would be the first school wide event that he had the gymnast would be attending together, so he had done his best to make sure it would go smoothly. The two of them had gone into town together to pick out some semi-formal ware, and put some effort into coordinating complementary outfits. He also attempted to try and teach Owari on how to act in a formal setting, though that went about as well as his previous attempts to save her grade in philosophy class...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. <i>I'm worrying too much. Everything will be fine as long as I don't panic...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Rip!* A tearing noise echoed out of the bathroom, breaking the reserve student out of his thoughts and causing him to start doing what he had just vowed not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... is everything okay in there?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, its fine. I just tried too hard to get this top on and my tits and gut caused it to explode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the color in his face suddenly faded. While normally he might find the described image to be...oddly appealing, the idea that his date had nothing to wear and the subsequent ridicule that would be thrown their way was nothing short of horrifying. He looked over at her closet and began digging through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything else you could wear for tonight?\" He pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" The topless Owari pondered as she examined herself in the mirror. She had gotten rather chubby thanks to her training for tonight's main event, as was clearly seen by the way her newly formed muffin took up part of her lap whenever she sat down. Though compared to the likes of Asahina, Tsumkiki, and Sonia, she wasn't really that big. \"Something of mine must still fit. Just grab all my shirts and throw them to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it.\" He responded. Unfortunately for him, tidiness and organization would never be two traits that could be used to describe Akane Owari. Clothes were placed into two piles at the base of her closet; one for clean clothes and one for dirty clothes. Beyond that there was no other levels of sorting, as socks and gym clothes lay clumped together with skirts, shirts, and extra pairs of shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...I wonder how Owari would take it if I offered to clean some of this up...</i> He mused as he grabbed a few white button shirts. After a few minutes of going through his date's clothes, he came to a realization. <i>Wait a minute...</i> \"...Owari, are these white button shirts the only ones you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... don't you ever want to wear anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? They're one of the few things that can actually hold my chest. Besides, you told me you liked them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" He admitted as a bit of color returned to his face. He brought the half dozen shirts he could find over to the bathroom door. He was planning on slowly opening the door just enough to hand them to her, but that idea was quickly dashed as she threw the door wide open upon hearing his approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Whadya find?\" She asked, her enormous breasts and sizable stomach in full view for Hinata to see. The kid's face turned bright red as he looked away as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwari noticed his awkwardness. \"...What? Never seen a girl topless before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Not really, no.\" He answered, still facing away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Well, come on then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on and take in the sights. We're dating now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded and quickly turned around to face her. Even if she was thinner than the other girls who had plumped up, Owari was still absolutely stunning. Her naturally large breasts had only filled out more with the extra weight, and her belly was big just big enough for him to bury his face in. Even concealed beneath the longer than usual skirt she wore, he could tell that her hips, butt, and thighs, had all filled out nicely too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" He murmured. \"You look fantastic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanks.\" She stepped forward and have him a hug, burying the boy's flace in her cleavage. Hinata rested there contently for a few moments, before the hug was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" She asked, glad to see that her boyfriend had calmed down significantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" He responded with a smile. \"Let's just throw one of these things on you real quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwari shoved the door to the gym open and the two of them joined in on the schmoozing. They were a good thirty minutes late, and the top that Owari managed to get on left little to the imagination, but the two of them didn't care. Owari spotted the chocolate fountain almost immediately and dragged Hinata over there. Surrounding it were two tables loaded with various marshmellows, crackers, and plain baked goods to dip into the gooey brown liquid flowing within. Above it all was a sign in big bright kanji that informed everyone that double dipping was strictly prohibited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hinata! Over here!\" A nearby voice called. The reserve student looked over and saw Aoi calling to him from the other side of the fountain. She was currently trying to fit as many plain donuts on her plate as possible to ensure maximum dipping potential. Standing next to her was Naegi, who was currently enjoying a small cup of hot chocolate. After Owari was satisfied with the size of her pre-competition snack, the two second game students joined their first installment counterparts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two, how've you been?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good.\" Asahina shoved a drenched donut into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi nodded in agreement. He then noticed how close that Hinata and Owari were standing. \"So... hope I'm not intruding on anything, but are you two dating now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Asked him out this week.\" She gave Hinata a slightly too hard pat on the back. He rubbed it, but he couldn't help but be happy at how readily Owari had agreed that they were together in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahina finished chewing. \"Wow, that's a funny coincidence. We kind of got together a few days ago too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi and Hinata looked at eachother, then glanced over at the girl the other was dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Is it me, or do we have way too many things in common for it to just happen by chance?\" Naegi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it... We do seem to have similar hair styles, and we kind of have the same personality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, you're both crazy.\" Owari crossed her arms. \"I mean look, Hinata and I are both taller than you and Aoi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But that's really it.\" He pointed at the two girls. \"You two even look like you could be sisters, and both of you are athletes of some sort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I like donuts!\" Aoi cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And meat's my favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sighed. \"...But it's still food. Both of you are pretty big eaters, even before all of this started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could question the similarities in their existence further, Tsumiki stepped up to the makeshift stage and approached the microphone. At her side was a rather large dark haired girl who oddly decided to wear a pair of reading glasses over a large pair of round sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...How is that even possible?</i> Hinata mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki cleared her throat. \"Good evening everyone! And welcome to the first annual Queen's Feast at Hope's Peak Academy. I hope you all have enjoyed the festivities so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the students in the audience murmured in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's great to here. Now, I'm here to announce that the main event of the night will be beginning shortly. All girls hoping to win our grand prize should head over to the far side of the gym now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" A determined energy began to flow off of Owari. \"This is what I ate all of that bacon for! Time to kick ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi grinned. \"You don't stand a chance. I bet your tiny tummy can't hold half of what mine can!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe playfully poked Akane right above her belly button. The taller girl returned the grin. \"You're on, shorty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two former athletes began to race each other over to the other side of the gym, where an elegantly decorated table awaited them. Two rows of chairs ran down the side, with Sonia, Pekoe, and Ibuki sitting on the right and Maizono, Agi, Yuki, and Celes sitting on the left. Tsumiki and her optically challenged friend were currently sitting at the head of the table. Asahina and Owari jumped into their assigned seats just as a row of silver covered dishes were placed in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round one: The appetizer menu.\" Tsumiki announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lids of the dishes were all lifted off, revealing a large assortment of pot stickers, crab cakes, fried dough, cheese sticks, french fries, and pretzels. All surrounding a rather large bowl of soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired girl smiled. \"Begin.\" </span></div></div>",

Stripped down to her lavender panties, bra, and white socks. Around her room laid tubs of finished ice cream, boxes of cookies, and candy wrappers which the detective had been shoveling into her mouth for the past few days as she looked over the case she'd been examining. She'd barely left her room and had been utilizing the excuse of being sick to escape any sort of obligations she may have had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer figure had clearly suffered, as little as there was left of it, as she'd looked to have put on another fifteen pounds after nonstop binging for these past few days. Her clothes had begun to start to rip at the seams and while normally she'd have either let them out or replaced them, her rather depressive state had left her unable to get said things done, thus she spend the days stuffing herself around in her already tighter underwear while looking over her hand written notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri had barely slept these past few days since she' spoken to Naegi; often times spending nights stuffing herself so that the pain would keep her awake to examine the case. Note after note she ent over but something kept her blind to what was going clearly right in front of her; her mind simply couldn't connect the pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo top it all off, Enoshima's words still haunted her late at night, often times leading Kirigiri to stuff herself to the point of pain so that she could instead ofcus on the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Listen, there's still time to save your feelings if you like, really impress him. Though there's no way he'll be yours if you keep pushing people away to look into why a few girls can't seem to stay the same pants size for too long.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi had been her closest friend, someone she could turn to for help and offer valuable info when her back was against a wall. They looked after another and did they best to stick together as best friends should; but ever since this whole case, their friendship had slowly been broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Dammit, I can't get my mind straight. I know the pieces should be here, but they're not. Everybody involved seems to know more about this case than I do and it's killing me to figure it out!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly laying down onto her bed with a bit of effort, she absently put a hand to her stuffed belly as it digested the ice cream she'd only recently finished stuffing into her stomach. Setting her notes to the side, the lavender haired girl began to breath in and out as her previous unhealthy mean was being digested. Already her underwear was feeling strained and almost to the point of breaking, as calories slowly added themselves to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'And then there's this...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri didn't know what Enoshima was up to and why she was fixated on everyone gaining weight, but whatever the reason was, it was sure to have some hidden motive behind it, one that was sure to be diabolical in nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her mind continued to debate against itself, a curious thing happened to the physically and mentally exhausted detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just what kind of thinking is that?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes snapping into focus, she spotted a small figure crouching atop her globe of a stomach, carelessly reading a mystery novel as shespoke her words. Kirigiri took note that the figure looked to be a smaller version of her past thin self, decked in her classic uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'll ask you again, what kind of thinking is that?\"</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\"I'll ask you again, what kind of thinking is that?\"</i> Spoke the mini-giri currently existing atop her globe of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes momentarily to regain some focus, she tried to draw a logical conclusion to what she was seeing before a thought came to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hallucinating, I've been up for a few days and the mental stress and exhaustion has caused me to hallucinate a smaller me, the thin image is probably because of my associating it with a better me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling rather proud of herself for coming to such a logical answer, she didn't really know how to feel when she saw her 'mini me' nod at the explanation, giving herself a proud almost happy look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes, I'm just a part of you that your mind you unknowingly unleashed in this inner turmoil. I'd applaud you for your point on deduction if I didn't have my hands full at the moment.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing off the page in her novel, Mini-giri placed a bookmark in the book before closing the novel, tucking it behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, just why the hell did you decide to show up. I assume you know that I'm not particularly fond of having a mental breakdown right now so please explain why I felt to inclined to talk to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly standing up, Mini-giri set her cold eyes on Kirigiri's, the sight of witch actually sent a chill through the larger girls form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Thanks for reminding me of my purpose here; I've got a question for you, answer it fairly and I might just give you the answers you've been looking for. Ready?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Do you care about Naegi?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking all of this in, the detective kept a blank face as Mini-giri began to pace back and forth on the large girls belly fat, not even breaking to take a breath as she continued to talk to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's a simple question; don't waste your time thinking about it. You don't care about him, you could do so much better than him! You could find any fanboy, chubby chaser, or average Joe and he'd probably be a million times better than Naegi.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMini-giri slowly walked towards the still quiet girl, whose eyes had a begun to gain a blank look to them as past experiences and memories flooded her mind about the question posed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Face it, you were sick of him. He was boring, stupid, and the only real info help he ever gave you, you could have done on your own without any trouble. You didn't need him, but you kept him around. It's a catch-22 in every form. If I'm not making this clear enough, allow me to spell it out for you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Naegi Sucked</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMini-giri walked along Kirigiri's body as she approached her face, her eyes never leaving Kirigiri's empty ones as a more and more angry expression came to Mini-giri's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's just how it is. Don't even try to deny it, he wasn't anything special at all. In a school of talented people in every room, he was the odd man out, the black sheep of the flock and you and everyone else knew it!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping off the body, Mini-giri arrived at Kiri-giri's face, turning her still blank face towards her as she glared into her void eyes, she spoke once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So despite everything that happened, explain this to me. Why? Why'd you do it? Why the hell are you still thinking of Naegi? Why the hell do you still care about that loser wannabe?! After all the hours you wasted around him when you could have been carving out a legacy, you should be happy to be away from him! Weren't you the girl who was always dreaming of being the worlds greatest detective? Didn't you care, not having enough time to peruse the more cases? Were all those years of training second to this one guy?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMini-giri seemed almost lost as she tried to understand what Kirigiri had been doing. None of what she'd done had been making sense to her and it was literally driving her insane. She slowly began to grow as she soon stood at the same height as Kirigiri, her arms pinning the unresponsive girl down as she tried to find some answer for the choices Kirigiri had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You could go about your detective lifestyle and everything would be for the better. Junko would be brought to justice, Hopes Peak would return to normal, your detective career would become something of legends, and Naegi would be happy; happy with Asahina, regardless of what happens in the future. But you had to throw that all away, didn't you?! WHY?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMini-giri now straddled Kirigiri as she grabbed the girls face, wanting the girl to look her in the eyes and give her a straight answer to the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Quiz time's over! It's time to give me a straight answer! Do you care about Naegi? SPIT IT OUT!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarity slowly began to return to Kirigiri's eyes are she looked up at her clone, a certain fire now resided in those eyes now as they seemed more focus than they had in weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course I do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting her teeth, the larger girl began trying to sit up, the weight of her body and fake self keeping her down and slowing progress. Her eyes held a life in them never before seen as she pushed herself to not only get up but reply to what was essentially herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I loved every minute with him! You'd have to be crazy not to see it!  Kind, gentile, understanding; some girls only aspire for looks but he had everything I ever wanted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe false Kirigiri began to expand with every word as pounds appeared on her body, her shirt began to tighten as her boobs pushed against her shirt and bra. Her skirt's button seemed to explode off as her panties tightened and her lower half expanded with fat and cellulite. Even her face blew up as a double chin formed while her clothes began to rip to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So don't ask me such, stupid, QUESTIONS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final push, she was sitting up as the rest of false kirigiri's clothes tore to pieces, leaving the now fat fake girl falling onto her butt on the floor. Now sitting, the real Kirigiri threw her legs out of bed, rising herself out so that she could act on what she was feeling at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask me again and again, I won't deny it anymore. I care about Naegi and I won't let anything else get in my way of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the naked fake Kirigiri stood up and faced herself. Both girls liked almost identical aside from the fact the real Kirigiri was still dressed in her underwear. Giving the real Kirigiri a smile, she seemed to fade out as the real Kirigiri smiled at the epiphany she'd experienced before turning to the door. Seemingly not caring about the fact she only had on socks, a straining bra, and panties that looked ready to tear, she ran out the door, one thought on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi</span></div></div>",

It was barely hanging on by the button. Her breasts were now two giant globes of fat that hung over her large muffin top of a stomach. Her ass was covered with buckets of cellulite. And her face was much thicker then it was before, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet, she's still not as fat as Sonia or Aoi...\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?

Gears ground loudly as bursts of steam began to erupt from the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uhm, this wasn't meant to happen!\" Tsumiki wailed as she frantically tried to get the device back in working order using a remote control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments of mechanical failure later, the tank split open into two four equal parts, standing in the dead center of the tank was none other than the esteemed detective herself. She wiped a smudge of feeder juice off her lips and locked eyes with Tsumiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi's eyes widened. \"Kyoko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It's been awhile, everyone. I trust you've all had a lovely dinner in the company of our host?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few groans from the assembled girls. All the lovely formal wear that they had worked so hard to acquire lay in twisted fragments around their now exposed bellies. The toll that this feast and many feasts previous had taken on their figures was blatantly obvious to all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kirigiri! Um, hello.\" The nurse stammered out, a hand awkwardly draped over her lap to make sure that any tears in her underwear weren't exposed. \"I'm sorry, but if you wanted to compete you would have needed to get here on time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not here for your game. I'm here to propose a new one.\" She pointed a finger directly at Tsumiki, who involuntarily slid her chair a bit closer to the disguised Junko's chair for reassurance. \"One last round: Our course will be a nice serving of strawberry shortcake. The winner will be named the champion of this competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's hardly fair for all the others that have competed so far!\" Tsumiki cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri smiled, before reaching into her pocket and unveiling over a dozen tickets to the hot springs resort. \"I think I can more than compensate everyone here for their troubles. Even those who aren't crowned champion shall be going to that resort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDogged cheers erupted from nearly every competitor. The relief that their struggle need not go any further caused several of the contestants to collapse into deep food comas on the spot. Maizono and her fellow pop idols simultaneously dropped their faces into their plates, while Ibuki just leaned her head back as she began to snore loudly. Content with her performance, Celes waved a hand as her manservants lifted her seat up and carried her out of the gym to her evening bath, one of them stopping to grab the ticket from Kyoko on the way out. Pekoe excused herself quietly, adjusting her blade over her rounded shoulders as she departed. Soon, the only competitors left standing were Owari, Asahina, Sonia, Tsumiki, and the dual glasses wearing girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I believe your contestants have agreed to my proposal.\" She approached the table, each step she took was filled with the energy of those who were certain of their path. As she sat down in one of the now vacant chairs, Naegi came running over to speak with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kyoko! What made you decide to show up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to face the Luck student. \"...I was having a difficult time accepting the new reality of things. However, I am past that sorry state now. I've come here to show everyone what I'm capable of. I am going to win the competition, and then we are all going to take a nice relaxing vacation away from this school for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Couldn't you have just given us some tickets after the competition was over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri's eyes widened a bit in realization. She pulled Naegi in a bit close to whisper to him. \"...I was only able to get so many tickets on short notice, there is only so much data that Chihiro can move around. I still need to win to make sure that everyone can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her attention back to Tsumiki. \"I'd also like to make a personal wager. If I win, I would like everything that has been taken from me returned, and I would like the chance to speak with our host alone about her recent turnabout in interests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki fidgeted nervously in her seat. \"W-why would you want to make a friendly competition so cut-throat with gambling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because. If you win, I will wipe my hands of this case completely. No more investigations, no more questioning, and no more digging into your personal life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired girl suddenly smiled and began slowly clapping. \"I'm impressed, Kiri. Way to finally nut up about something you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective's heart skipped a beat. <i>That voice! Could it be...Her? The body type is completely different and so's her hair color, but they sound almost identical...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki squeeked in shock and turned her head to her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, dear. The good detective wishes to raise the stakes, so it's only right that we do so in kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...'Dear?'\" Asahina crossed her arms in confused thought. \"...Tsumiki, are you and this weird shades wearing girl together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki stuttered incoherently as her face flushed. As the disguised Junko placed a reassuring hand on her thigh though, her whole demeanor changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide smile broke across her face, a tiny amount of drool forming in the corner of her mouth.\"Why yes, that's correct! I love her more than anyone has ever loved someone! Meeting her was the most ecstatic and beautiful moment of my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi rubbed the back of his head nervously. <i>Well, that's one way to step out of the closet...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, my darling.\" The black haired girl swapped her glasses under her shades. \"Now then, I accept your terms, but I ask for a small stipulation: I wish to represent my dearest in this final round. My victory shall be her victory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you will allow me to speak with you in private about the recent happenings at this school as well then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes. If you can truly beat me while I'm in my own element, I'll answer any questions that you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Owari interjected. \"What If I win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth detective and mastermind slowly looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko shrugged, the glasses slipped out from underneath her shades. \"Huh... I dunno, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really get all this personal stuff you two are arguing about, but that spa resort probably has a penthouse room right? If I win I want to book some real R and R time for me and Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reserve student's face blushed. <i>Wow, she asked for something the both of  us could enjoy... I'm touched.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that sounds magical! I've never stayed in a foreign resort without needing to be chaperoned by my country's security forces. I think I'd like to ask for that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahina shot a quick glance over to Naegi before returning her attention to those assembled at the table. \"If we're upping the ante, then count me in too! That penthouse is going to me and Naegi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko felt a slight pain in her chest upon hearing her friend's request. But she couldn't let that bother her now. She was going to win and prove that she cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko's tongue rolled out of her mouth.\"Hmm... none of the original tickets we had rode the elevator all the way to the penthouse, but fuck it, I'm rich! If one of you girls can beat me at my own game, you deserve to take your man to the top! Yo Tsumiki, you did a great job tonight! Why don't you escort the boy over there back to his carbon copy? It'll give you a great seat to watch me crush these little skinny bitches into the ground!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse nodded happily as she walked over Naegi, gently taking him by the sleeve and dragging him back over to the spectator seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luck student frowned. <i>\"Carbon copy?\" We're not that similar... are we?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri nodded. She then sapped her fingers, and instantly the scattered dishes on the table were cleared away by the staff and a huge multi-layered shortcake soaked with delicious sweetened strawberry juice was placed in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last one standing...\" The detective announced as slices of cake were cut and handed to each of the remaining contestants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin!\" Junko declared.</span></div></div>",

Despite three of the girls already having been stuffing themselves with food, Kirigiri was at the same level of fullness as the others as she hadn't prepared her body for the amount of food as the other competitors had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Owari and Asahina, despite both girls having stuffed for hours on end to be in the competition, it was clear right from the get go that they were outclassed. The ferocity and tension between Kirigiri and Junko was so thick that the two of them were pulling ahead of the other two girls without them even having a chance to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahina's outfit was already in tatters, her top having busted open long ago, revealing the tight white bra that was even now breaking apart. Her stomach hung between her legs as he hunched over the table, trying her best to shove as much food into her mouth as possible while her panties were being shown more and more as with every slice shoved into her greedy mouth revealed the donut picture printed in the front of her panties. As Hinata engorged more and more, the donuts seemed to expand as her panties struggled to keep up with their wearer's girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Of all the days she had to wear those panties...'</i> Naegi muttered to himself as he tried to not picture the fact that his girlfriends panties were being seen by everyone around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite the turmoil Naegi was feeling, it couldn't compare to Hinata's as his girlfriend was practically nude from her overindulgence. Her shirt, already tight, had split long ago in the early rounds. Thankfully her shirt's remains were managing to cover her nipples... mostly, as every time Owari would reach for a piece of food, a brief glimpse of her nipples would flash. Her skirt had long since retired and now even her panties were being eaten up by her fat rolls, giving her a nude appearance to anyone just turning in. What's even worse for Hinata is that the whole time he was watching his girlfriend essentially eat naked in front of him, he couldn't deny just how hot it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Libido...\" Hinata muttered under his breath as he couldn't tear his eyes from the scene before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as stated before, both girls were quickly falling behind the ferocity of Junko and Kirigiri, and in their attempts to speed up their intake, they pushed too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RIIIIIIIIIIP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Owari and Asahina shred the last of their clothes at that moment as they both reached for their favorite foods. Jumping in shock of the noise their clothes made, or at least as much as a jump as girls their size could get, they became unbalanced and began to fall. Trying to hold onto the table as their bulks began to pull them out of the chairs, both naked girls simultaneously hit the ground at the same time, actually shaking the stage as their bulks impacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"muh... come on... gah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... almost... gah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls struggled for a few seconds as they tried to regain their places at the table but their endurance gave out as they were forced to lay there nude, their meals digesting. Thankfully for their boyfriends, their fat covered anything from being shown aside from some boob shots caught by a local photographer which would become popular pictures in the following days online on FA websites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all this happening around them, both Junko and Kirigiri paid the pair no mind as they continued to lock eyes with one another and shovel food into their mouths; their focus strictly put on shoveling food into their mouths and glaring at the other contestant.</span></div></div>",

Her clothes had begun to feel uncomfortably tight, and she could her the faintest sound of the fabric around her middle beginning to give way like the wardrobes of all the other girls who had competed today. What's worse, it was quickly becoming apparent that her stomach was becoming full, causing her to involuntarily slow down the pace at which she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko picked up on this fact immediately. \"What's the matter, Kiri? Starting to see that you may have literally bitten off more than you can chew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly, I just needed a moment to clear out some excess air.\" The detective did her best to stand her ground, then forced herself to catch back up in pace. As they continued though, it became obvious that while eating at this rate was doable though tiring for her, to Enoshima it was as if she were merely casually snacking. The mastermind cleared through slices with ease, alternating between cutting them into equal sized chunks to shoving the entire piece into her mouth at once as she saw fit. Her movements were practiced and exact, and her stomach capacity seemed bottomless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...She isn't slowing down. I thought coming in late would give me an edge, but already this is turning into an uphill battle. I can see now that this girl, whoever she is, is a complete professional when it comes to eating a vast amount of food.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n The mastermind smirked, expertly fitting her glasses back under her shades with on hand as she ate with the other. \"I know what you're thinking: How is it that even after a gargantuan multi-coursed feast, this alluring young woman sitting across from you can still eat so much so effortlessly? Well, as I have long since become an expert in maintaining perfect pronunciation and grammar while my mouth is full, I feel as though you've earned the right to hear a little explanation. Ever since I was a small child, I have always had a burning desire to eat. If there was food to be had, I would find it; routinely sending my mother back to the grocery store after she had realized that I had eaten everything she had bought before it had even been taken out of the grocery bags. For some reason my parents thought this was a problem for some reason, so they began to limit my access to food to a meager breakfast, lunch, and dinner schedule. I soon grew resentful of how they treated me, so I would take every opportunity I could to break out of our home and spend all the money I could find on all of the delicious fried and sugary foods I managed to get my hands on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed the fork aside, opting to instead grab whole fistfuls of cake at once and shove them into her mouth. \"In short, what I am trying to tell you Kirigiri is that food isn't just a guilty enjoyment to me, it is what makes life worth living.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko's eye's widened. She forced herself to stop long enough to respond properly so she wouldn't choke. \"...That's insane. You have no goals beyond such base desires?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong, I have hopes and dreams as you do, but they all stem from a single wish: The enjoyment of food. I am a true glutton, one who's body is a result of a lifetime of stuffing myself to elation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko quickly chugged down a carton of milk and slammed it on the table, her glazed covered face shifting into a smug smile. \"In other words, someone like you who feels as though her appetite is a burden will never be able to defeat me at the dinner table!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mastermind's look of pure confidence began to force cracks into Kirigiri's resolve. Her hands began to tremble as she forced herself to continue eating. <i>Such arrogance, and yet its as plain as day that she has the power to back it up... I-I may have made a grave error...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki watched as her lover gained ground with a twinkle in her eye. Owari, Asahina, and the other contestants that had passed out had been carried over to a designated rest area by the nurse, where they were kindly draped in sheets so that their naughty bits would remain concealed for the rest of the night. Naegi and Hinata each sat next on the edge of the bed where their overstuffed girlfriends lay, a gentle hand grasp shared between both pairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahina was the first to stir. \"N-Naegi? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Naegi hastily decided to leave out the part where she and Owari had collapsed buck naked for all to see. \"Its down to just Kirigiri and that one girl now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swimmer frowned. \"Damn... that means I lost, huh? I was really looking forward to going on vacation with you too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, don't worry about it.\" He placed a hand along her cheek. \"You did great out there, and it sounds like we'll be getting tickets to go to that spa resort anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed weakly. \"Yeah... I'm used to staying in cheaper rooms anyway. It'll probably still be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi nodded, before turning back to face the table. \"...I'm kind of worried about Kirigiri right now, it looks like she's starting to slow down and that one girl is starting to sound pretty aggressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swimmer angled her head so that she could get a view of the event. \"Hmm... you might be right... Ts-Tsumiki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse giddily approached her friend. \"Hey, Aoi! How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been better... Um, hey listen. Is there any chance you could convince your-um...'associate' to go easier on Kiri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki twisted one of her hair ribbons around her finger, a dreamy smile on her face. \"I'm sorry, Aoi, but I couldn't. This is what my dearest wanted; I couldn't possibly get in the way of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsumiki, please! Kiri's still a lightweight, I don't want her hurting herself trying to out eat a total pro! I know she's been rude to you, but I'm asking you as a friend to please make sure nothing bad happens to her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the gleeful look on her face began to fade as she realized that two people whom she was close to had conflicting interests. Junko was truly the greatest thing to have happened to her, but Asahina had also been a great friend who was always up for hanging out with her when she wasn't doing her lover's bidding. She had spent most of her life pining for someone, anyone to accept her; but now there were multiple people who cared about her. She had no experience with juggling the whims of those around her, and the thought of having to risk upsetting either of them caused her to panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could say anything though, a loud thud echoed throughout the room. The three of them turned to see that Kirigiri had fallen face forward onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko smiled triumphantly. \"Oh come on, Kirigiri, I was just starting to feel a tiny bit full. Don't tell me you're giving up already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko groaned despondently. <i>...It's impossible... she can't be beat...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi tensed up. <i>Damn, this isn't good... I-I have to act!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyoko!\" The Luck student called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>N-Naegi...?</i> The detective glanced over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give up just yet! You can still do this!\" He shouted <i>Oh man this is a bad idea... but if Tsumiki can't end the competition early then winning is our only option.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He... he believes in me!</i> Kyoko felt her face flush.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's amazing what the mind can accomplish when it's entire focus is put into a single task. Despite stuffing herself to her natural limits, Kirigiri continued to shovel food into her mouth quicker and quicker as she began to catch up to her rival in this affair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost like a train warming it's pistons up, Kirigiri's pace began to increase as her pained expression on her face began to fade. Her eyes seemingly glazed over as Naegi's cried for her victory reached her ears, the thought of Naegi allowing her to abandon all thoughts of giving up and force all feeling of pain and fullness out of her system. Slice after slice, cake after cake, and calorie after calorie disappeared into her gullet at a quickening pace, as in just under a minute the once full girl caught up to Junko who was not starting to regard Kirigiri in a new light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her enemy making her move, Junko began to pick up the pace as well, not wanting a skinny bitch like Kirigiri to overtake her. Both girl's thick arms began to blur to the spectators as they pushed themselves to get as much food into their stomachs; Both girl's faced seemed devoid of expressions as they only thought of putting more and more food into their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What kind of girl is this...' Were Juno's thoughts as she took a quick glance at Kirigiri while shoving another slice of cake into her open mouth. 'What kind of girl can push past her limits like this! She's only just begun to gain weight, and yet she's already at this level!? HOW?!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri's mind was blank to all thought, only one single image was going through her mind at that moment and that was Naegi cheering her on. Her very will wouldn't let her disappoint her Naegi; similar to how Junko's pride wouldn't let herself loose to this newcomer. It was the same idea as an immovable object colliding with an unstoppable force, both wouldn't back down and only one side running out of juice would leave a victor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to slow down as the entire world disappeared to the two competitors, the entire universe could very well have ended right then and there and the two wouldn't have noticed as their eyes met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Such power...' was the similar thoughts between the two girls as they regarded the girl in front of themselves. 'I still won't loose though...' came their simultaneous thoughts as the world seemed to catch up with them and the cheers and rallies from the audience entered their ears once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing burst and tore, chairs strained, and dish after dish as devoured by the two titans of gluttony as neither refused to bow down. Still, despite both girls eating at such a high level, their bodies could only take so much, and as a final cake was placed on the table, both girls launched themselves at it with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I... Won't... Lose...' came the thought's of Junko, whose mind was clouded from the euphoria she'd been feeling from the stuffing. To her this was as good as sex, the feeling of her expanding body being pushed for the first time in a long time lit a fire between her thighs her lover couldn't even have her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Naegi... Watch... Me... Win...' Kirigiri's own body was catching up with her as the pain her mind was so desperately trying to block out, was coming around. Her stomach was at its limits and what remained of her clothing was as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls panties and bra's were in tatters, only threads and fat keeping them modest from the audience. While Kirigiri's own were rather modest, Junko's rather lacy and provocative black underwear had her lover wiping drool from her mouth every time her fat caused the cloth to be torn a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both girls beset on the final cake, the two girls hit their walls; only the cases were vastly different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri, as she stuffed another slice into her mouth, let out a pained groan as her stomach strained under the amount of food being shoved into it. Near bursting, the pain Kirigiri was feeling was almost agonizing, and only her food clouded mind was keeping her from wailing in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Junko's pleasure from the stuffing as hit it's peak as she moaned out in a climax, her legs quivering and giving out on her. Several boys, and a few girls, in the audience had several nosebleeds as the realization of what happened to her reached their minds. Tsumiki meanwhile had sported an atomic blush as she witnessed her lover essentially get off in front of her. Resisting the urge to take Junko right then and there, she was forced to wait the competition out before she and Junko could enjoy themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls fell flat on their stomachs at the same time, immobilized by their pain and pleasure, asonly two slices of cake remained. Both girls currently rested on their bellies, but neither had the strength or energy to reach the final two pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU CAN DO IT HONEY! TAKE HER DOWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a rather stunning twist, the usual quiet Tsumiki all but screamed at her lover to deliver the final blow to Kirigiri. The previously glazed look in Junko's eyes gradually faded as she was pulled down from what had been her greatest orgasm to finish off Kirigiri's chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill laying on her stomach, Junko heaved herself up slightly and began to crawl towards the final two pieces, her stomach dragging on the table with every awkward crawl. Her muscles were still a bit weak from the experience she'd had and thus her progress was a bit slow as the blush on her face had yet to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri meanwhile was rubbing her belly as her body had nearly shut down from the pain of eating. She simply couldn't bring herself to finish off the cakes, despite her brain all but screaming at her to win this competition. She was done, no if's an's or but's about it. All she wanted to do was close her eyes and sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KIRIGIRI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes snapping open, her thick neck turned to see Naegi yelling at her. His eyes closed and his hands cupping his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KIRIGIRI! WIN! YOU HAVE TO WIN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's right...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her chubby legs underneat her swollen globe of a stomach, she began to rise to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I almost forgot why I was doing this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick eye over towards Junko showed that she was closing in on the cake, her stomach barely slowing her down but her eyes glazed over in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't let Naegi down...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost at her feet, Kirigir' heaved herself up to her full height, her almost nude glory stunning the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging the distance ebtween her and the cake, she took a step forward<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'MUST!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot didn't touch the table as Kirigiri allowed herself to fall forward, just as Junko was reaching out for the last two slices of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'WIN!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a resounding crash, Junko smashed onto the table, her mouth landing atop the platter the cake was on and eating it before Junko's now wide eyes. However, this action didn't stop here as the table burst from the combined weight of Kirigiri and Junko, dropping the two girls as the last of their clothes tore off as they hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri, thankfully was able to land without much issue, as she'd braced for the fall she'd taken; her belly and arms absorbing most of the impact; however the pain from such a thing caused her to moan out as she hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko however didn't have such a good time, as since her hand was out when she fell, she wasn't able to stabilize herself and as luck would have it, she landed on her face, knocking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth naegi and Tsumiki ran towards the stage towards the two competetors, checking to see if either were alright from the fall. Upon reaching her lover, Tsumiki could only giver her a sad smile as she saw her lover knocked out from the fall, a content smile on her face though despite the fact she'd lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri meanwhile was being looked over by naegi, the rather innocent boy doing his best to not look at her nude body as he looked her over for any harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm *Urp* fine Naegi...\" came Kirigiri's tired voice as she began to rub her globe of a stomach, the gut now as tight as a drum and sticking out like a beach ball from her thick body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi, satisfied with Kirigiri not being hurt, looked over at Tsumiki, who could only give Naegi a sad shake of the head. Instantly smiling, the good luck student turned back to Kirigiri. \"Congrats Kirigiri, you won!\" The smile on her crushes face was enough for the detective as she gave her own content smile back. \"Yeah... thanks... Naegi...\" Feeling suddenly exhausted from the whole experience, her adrenaline wearing off, Kirigiri simply laid where she was, content and knowing that she'd beat Junko. In seconds, she was asleep, sleeping off the meal.</span></div></div>",

She had been fattened up while she was asleep. Her stomach was now down to her ankles. She now had 3 chins. Her breasts were larger than ever before. Her butt was nothing more than a blob of cellulite. Worst of all, she was completly naked.<br>\r\n\"Don-don't worry. Your still not as fat as Hina and Sonia.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kirigiri awoke as the first lights of day met her face. Her eyes slowly scanned the room around her as the memories of last night's event trickled back to the forefront of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's right... I had bet it all on that competition...And won!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe attempted to sit up, and realized that her expanded and still slightly stuffed stomach was making it more difficult than what she had been used to. To make matters worse, the hospital gown that she had been wrapped in after her clothes were torn apart was far too tightly fitting to be comfortable to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Let's hope that the new information I get out of Tsumiki and that other girl can help me close this case, I get the feeling that I'm going to need to adjust my wardrobe yet again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the nurse's office slowly opened with a slight squeak. After a moment's pause, Naegi walked through the door and approached her, her signature detective's jacket slung over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... hey, how are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly glanced down at her puffed up frame. \"I believe 'like an overstuffed sausage' would be the appropriate simile to describe this situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed the back of his neck nervously. \"It-it's not that bad, really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle smile formed on her face. \"It is kind of you to try and downplay my situation, however I think its obvious to everyone how fat I have gotten recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused momentarily to think of the best way to continue the conversation. \"...Well, hey. At least it hasn't been for nothing. You won the contest last night. You beat the hostess at her own game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, but I want you to know that I never would have been able to beat her... If I hadn't heard you cheering me on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I didn't do that much, all I did was try to give you a little moral boost...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile grew wider. \"You really are too modest... your 'little moral boost' was the one thing that allowed me to win. To hear that you believed in me was the fire that drove me far past what I would have been capable of normally. You may be known at this school as \"The Ultimate Lucky Student\", but after working with you for so long, I now know your true talent: You have the power to inspire people, Naegi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi's face began to flush. \"W-wow, you really think that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, finally pulling herself into a seated position in the process. \"I do. Your boundless optimism has allowed me time and again to conquer some of the strongest obstacles I have ever face. Last night I faced two such obstacles: The second of which was besting Tsumiki's associate in a competition in which she was far more skillful than I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the first one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up from the bed and looked him directly in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Was a battle I had with my inner demons. I realized that for the longest time I was suppressing what I truly wanted. Investigating is my passion in life, but one's life cannot be entirely defined by one's profession. I now know that I want more than just a career...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else could you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to think of any other way to express her feelings, Kyoko through herself at him, wrapping her arms around his slender torso and passionately kissing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You, Naegi. I want you in my life as more than just a friend. No amount of fortune or fame my career could bring me will give me the same fulfillment as knowing that you will be by my side...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe forced her eyes closed, a single tear streaming down her face. \"I know Aoi has laid claim to your heart first, but I beg you: please consider my true feelings for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi was petrified. When he had decided to come visit Kirigiri before he and the others left for the spa resort, he had not expected her to open up to him so much; let alone declare her love for him. It was true that they had been close almost the entire time they had been enrolled at the academy, but Kirigiri had always seemed so distant; to the point that he ha long thought the possibility of them ever getting together was very unlikely. Now the opportunity was here, but another dream had formed in his mind; one in which he and Aoi could have a happy future together. These two incompatible dreams begun to battle in his mind, a battle that left the rest of his body powerless to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi-yah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the nurse's office suddenly slammed against the interior wall as Asahina kicked it open. \"Kyoko! I-I can't believe you would do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective abruptly broke the embrace and faced her. \"Asahina! I...I can explain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! I may not be that fast to figure things out sometimes, but I don't need your help to understand this one!\" The former athlete began to cry. \"I heard everything you said to him! You tried to steal Naegi from me! Even after we told you that we were dating! I-... I thought you were my friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelmed by her feelings, she ran forward and shoved Kirigiri over. The detective stumbled back and fell onto the bed with a soft thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say 'you're sorry'!\" Aoi screamed as she leaned over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri just stared back at her, a storm of conflicting emotions stewing underneath her surface; leaving her feeling sick to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fine then!\" Aoi shouted after waiting a few seconds. She broke into a dead sprint, exiting the room in record breaking time despite her massive girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aoi! Wait!\" Naegi shouted as his girlfriend's anguish drove him to act once more. Without saying goodbye to the detective, he ran out after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri watched as he left, her jacket sliding off his shoulder and landing at the foot of the bed. After a few moments, she reached down, picked it up, and wrapped it around herself as she began gazing emptily at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...What have I done?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver shuttle that had been rented to ferry the students to the resort was nothing to sneeze at. The cushioned seats delightfully wrapped the passengers in comfort, the mini bar in back offered a wide array of exotic non alcoholic beverages, and there was even a television display that could play videos on demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell yeah! I've always wanted to try out paper-view!\" Owari grinned, before taking a big sip of her glass of cola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Uh, dear, I think you mean 'pay-per-view'.\" Hinata corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corpulent gymnast scratched her head in confusion. \"What? Why would you ever pay for a tv movie when you're already paying for the tv? I thought movies just played sometimes depending on the channel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are paying for the luxury of being able to select any video we desire.\" Celes took a sip of tea from the tea set she had brought with her before adjusting her tight fitting dress slightly. \"Surely even a simpleton like you can understand that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch it!\" Owari cracked her knuckles. \"Keep making fun of me and I'll shove that teacup so far up your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata wrapped his arms around her's gently forcing her to lower her fists. \"Easy, Owari... she's not worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sneered for a bit longer, before sighing deeply. \"Yeah... you're right. Besides...\" She sat herself on his lap facing him, her belly crashing against his skinny frame. \"I'd rather burn some energy another way, if you know what I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reserve student's face had never been such a deep shade of red before in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ultimate Gambler clicked her cup and saucer together in indignation. \"Such vulgarity! I'm surprised the school didn't see it fit to award you the title 'Ultimate Tramp'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwari twisted around to face her from her current position. \"That's it! Hope you're looking forward to shitting fine china for the rest of your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Owari, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of the students found amusement in the gymnast's knee-jerk reactions, Naegi and Asahina sat near the front of the shuttle separate from everyone else. The swimmer currently had her head buried in his chest, his shirt soaked through with her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed a hand through her hair and down her neck. \"...It's okay, Aoi. I'm here for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a moment to blow her nose on a bar napkin, one of many she had been through during the trip. \"I just-... Why? Why would she try and break us apart like that? Was it something that I did? Am I... am I a shitty friend, Naegi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No. You're a really good person, Aoi. You always put others before yourself, and you've helped me and Kirigiri out a lot over the years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks for that...\" She resumed leaning against him. \"But what went wrong then? What drove her to do something so mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe balled his free hand. \"I... I don't know. She's been under a lot of stress lately, we all have. I guess something she had buried somewhere got dredged up somehow... I know she never meant to hurt you like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave her a soft kiss on the cheek. \"Let's- let's just forget about it for now, okay? Let's just try and have fun at this place while we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up and smiled weakly at him. \"Y-yeah. I'd like that a lot.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though even though he and Aoi did have lots of fun, everything Kirigiri earlier today repeated in her head and left him confused himself. Her feelings seemed genuine, and seemed to really care for him, and it left him wondering about he he felt about her, and how those feelings compared to what he felt for Aoi. He spent the day doing the best he could to keep those thoughts in the back of his head, just trying to enjoy the resort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime that day though, Naegi did decide to go cool off in the pool while Aoi ate at the buffet for the sixth time that day. She was enjoying herself munching away on the delicious food. Though in the middle of her big binge, a certain someone sat down next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Aoi! I see you're enjoying yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Tsumiki! You bet. This place is the best. I can't thank you enough for bringing us here.\" Aoi said before grabbing more food while she listened to her friend talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-D-Don't thank me. It was all Ju-Uhh I mean it was all my dear Murkuro's idea for the contest and the prize. It was a shame Kirigiri had to ruin everything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of that name, Aoi stopped eating and dropped the food she was eating. She had almost forgotten about her, but now that she remembered, she was sad again. Still, she tried to hide her sadness from Tsumiki and pretend it didn't happen. After all, she had nothing to do with it. <i>Or so she thought.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she did kinda mess things up, but at least she got plenty of tickets so everyone could come and we could have a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she?\" Tsumiki said in a tone Aoi had never heard from her before. She sounded so serious when she said and nothing like the nervous girl she had become friends with over the week. It kinda scared her how dead serious she sounded when she said those two words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so certain you would win. After all, I've seen how much of a big eater you are. You would have won the prize yourself and you could have enjoyed a whole weekend with Naegi all to yourself. Then gave everyone tickets, and ruin your chance to spend a romantic vacation all alone with Naegi by inviting all your friends. Sure it's nice to see them, but we both knew you were looking forward to a nice vacation just between the two of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I...N-n-no. No! You heard her, she just did that so that she could get whatever she lost and talk to your friend. Yeah...that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Then it seems really weird for her to show up the way she did. She just had to show up only in her underwear, as if she were <b>seducing</b> someone. I also have this crazy feeling, she was there to humiliate a <b>certain someone</b> she was competing against in front of the whole school.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi clenched her fists in anger as she listened to Tsumiki. She did her best to hide her rage, but Tsumiki could practically see her eyes turn green with envy. Sure she was angry when she heard she loved him, but she did start to forgive her since she did suspect she had feeling for him before they started dating and did secretly feel bad for it. But listening to the way Tusmiki described it, now it seems like this whole thing was an attempt to ruin a romantic weekend, and make her look bad. <i>'Some friend.'</i> She thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki smiled as she looked at Aoi. She did just as Junko said and it was working perfectly. All she did was stretch the truth and she practically had Aoi right where she wanted her. After the competition, Junko realized she had to honor her part of the bargain, but that didn't mean she would make thing easy. She did intend to give Kirigiri her prize, but not in a way she'd expect. Plus she saw potential in Aoi, as a close ally and a way to keep Kirigiri off their backs. A little more time <i>\"talking\"</i> to Aoi should be enough to to turn one of Kirigiri's closest friends against her and make things even more difficult for the detective. </span></div></div>",

While they had only arrived a few hours ago, everyone that had gone on the trip could already say that it had been worth the three hour drive it had taken to get here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone except for one particularly temperamental student that is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Kuzuryu...\" Hinata ventured after a few minutes of awkward silence had passed. \"Was there any particular reason that we had to get a separate pool from everyone one else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Yakuza cracked his knuckles. \"For shit's sake, don't you know that you're not supposed to talk business when you're on vacation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reserve student shuddered. \"Business? I just wanted to know why we couldn't use the co-ed bath with everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGundam crossed his arms. \"I too wish to hear an explanation.  While my beasts could easily fell any mortal threat, I wish to rejoin the princess' side as soon as possible to ensure that nothing other worldly will harm her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuzuryu scowled. \"Argh, fine! If you assholes are going to be so pushy about it, I wanted to go somewhere where I could voice a concern of mine in private.\" He looked away from the other students, as if he was embarrassed. \"It's... it's about Peko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sweat drop traveled down the back of Hinata's head. <i>...Wait, so he pulled us aside because he's having girl problems? Why didn't he just tell us that in the first place?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGundam suddenly smiled. \"Aha! I too have noticed the change in Ms. Pekoyama's demeanor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuzuryu balled his fists. \"Dammit! It really was that obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed! It is clear that our bushido in training has already been tempted by foul spirits. If we do not cleanse her soul now she is sure to become the next Black Samurai and lay waste to countless innocent lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Yakuza slammed his palm into his forehead. \"Fucking hell, Peko isn't becoming a demonic samurai! She's just-\" His rage quickly burnt out into a tired exasperation. \"... It just feels that she's getting kind of distant, you know? I thought things were going great. I took her out to dinner as often as I could, we talked a bunch about shit we liked, we went to that one podunk American ice cream place... then all of a sudden she starts wandering off on her own and stops talking to me... what the hell did I do wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata rubbed the back of his neck. \"Jeez. Um...I don't know. It doesn't really sound like its your fault, maybe something just came over her-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the siren song of the forces of evil!\" Gundam interjected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked. \"... As I was saying, maybe she feels uncomfortable with something right now and is trying to work it out herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuzuryu put his hat over his head despite the fact that they were still in the pool and pulled the brim over his eyes. \"Oh, I see... she's got some sort of problem, huh? Well, I can't call myself a real man while something, or someone, is bothering my girl now can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"Alright then, lets go solve this little problem of our's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's face went pale. <i>...I'm about to become a murder accomplice, aren't I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three students quickly dried themselves off and got dressed, afterwards they left the bathing area and returned to the main resort building and headed towards the room that Kuzuryu and Peko were sharing. Before they arrived though, they heard a sudden shout coming from the rec center. Upon arriving at source, they saw Owari and Peko standing on opposite sides of a space they had cleared and lined with protective mats. Owari had tossed her shirt aside, clad only in a very tight sports bra and a pair of boxer shorts that her muffin top drooped over on all sides; particularly in the front. Peko meanwhile, was clad in traditional eastern swordsman attire, the robe and sash around her waist obviously custom made to fit her enlarged frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeko arched an eyebrow as she saw the others enter. \"Kuzuryu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" He asked, glancing over at Owari. \"Is she the one that's bothering you, Peko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Ms. Akane is here at my request. I wished to measure my technique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gymnast waved to her boyfriend as she caught a glimpse of him. \"Yo, Hinata! You here to watch me kick Peko's ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Yakuza rolled his eyes. \"As if. There's no way a brainless brute like you can win against her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Who you calling a brute?\" Owari glared at the short criminal. \"That's it! I'm not taking this shit anymore. Hinata, I need you to bet all of your money on me, I'm gonna teach Babyface here a lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, you want me to bet my entire savings on a sparing match?\" Hinata looked physically pained by the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Is that not something people do?\" Owari responded with a confused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nickname seemed to have struck a nerve with the criminal heir, but in the presence of the girl he loved, he took a deep breath and tired to be the better man. \"Please, like Hinata's pocket change would mean anything to me. But tell you what, if by some horrible twist of reality you do manage to beat Peko, dinner's on me for the rest of the year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck yes!\" Owari cheered. \"Did you hear that, hun? Dinner's on the Yakuza from now on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...I'm not sure I want a crime family buying things for me...</i> A shadow fell over the reserve student's eyes as he looked to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the parameters set, Peko and Owari began circling each other along the mats. Then a split second later Owari hurled herself at the swordswoman, knocking her a step back before she could adopt the proper counter stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeko reached for where her sword normally rested on her hip. <i>H-how, where is my weapon?!</i> Her hand flailed around her side for a few moments before finally finding the hilt of her wooden practice blade. <i>Damn! I should have realized my reach would have to be longer to draw my blade now...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't!\" Owari shoved her arms under Peko's and lifted her off the ground slightly, forcing them up and causing her to lose her grip on her weapon. She then spun around and let gravity do its job, landing square on top of the bodyguard and pinning her to the ground under her considerable weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeko laid there montionless for a few seconds as she replayed what had happened in her head. That was it. She had lost almost instantly to an opponent because she was too fat to have drawn her sword in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... have failed.\" She murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwari released her from the grapple and cheered. \"Wooo! Oh yeah! What do you think of me now, Kuzu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short boy was speechless, a look of shock spread across his face. \"...P-Peko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gymnast ran over and took the Yakuza's wallet straight from his jacket pocket. \"I believe this is mine now!\" She then turned to Hinata. \"How was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh- yeah, great job dear!\" Hinata managed to blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Heh, thanks. Now come on, I saw that they had a fancy seafood place in this resort, and I've always wanted to know how much lobster I can eat in one sitting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's a very... specific thing to want to know...</i> The reserve student mused to himself as he was taken by the hand and practically dragged out of the room. Kuzuryu walked over to Peko's side and kneeled down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peko, you feeling okay?\" He said with genuine concern. \"That... that wasn't like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It is the way things are now...\" She closed her eyes, trying to fight back tears. \"I am unworthy to serve you now, that fight proved just how sloppy my technique has become. I could never properly protect you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're talking nonsense! I don't give a damn if Hinata's airhead won, I don't want you talkin' bad about yourself like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single tear ran down her cheek. \"...You are too kind, young master. However, in your position kindness may cost you your life. It... it is clear now what must be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swordswoman suddenly stood up, took a deep breath, then sprinted as fast as she could out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peko, wait!\" He cried after her, but she was already long gone; and somehow he knew that she wasn't coming back. He fell to his knees and began pounding the mat below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! Fucking damn it all to hell!\" He began to cry. Eventually he had lashed out so much that he was unable to rise from the floor, and passed out in the damp pool made from his own sorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGundam had watched his compatriot's breakdown in silence. As the scene drew to an end, he closed his eyes in contemplation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...I sense that dark times may be upon us soon.</i></span></div></div>",

Needless to say Kirigiri was capitalizing on this chance to have the mastermind out of the game and had prepared her interrogation accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrapping the girl's limbs to the bed with a few handcuffs; Kirigiri, who'd changed into a larger version of her uniform, sat on a chair next to the sleeping girl, a folder in one hand and a cookie in another, a small plate of them resting on the table. As she looked over the data, she was trying to piece together what she now new from the small tests she'd conducted on the girl while she lay sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously this girl wasn't Mukuro Ikusuba, as everyone else thought; some contacts in the police force had backed up the story when just a short while ago the real Mukuro had arrived via airplane, skinny. Unless the girl had managed to put on hundreds of pounds in a few days, the real Mukuro wasn't present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mu...\" Came the sound of a soft groan as Junko began to wake up, the large girl coming out of her food coma to Kirigiri's interrogation. As the girls blue eyes opened slightly, they immediately shot to Kirigiri, lighting up in recognition before attempting to move. struggling for a moment before her brain managed to catch up with her body, the larger girl looked to her hands to see them handuffed to her bed as well as her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, isn't someone a bit kinky today. While I'd prefer it to be Tsumaki, I think she'll allow a bit of... fun.\" Turning her head to the detective and giving the girl a rather sultry look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost unphased by the girls rather flirtatious words, Kirigiri instead pulled a picture from the folder she as carrying and turned it towards Junko, who upon seeing Mukuro's picture began to sweat a bit as she realized the train of thought Kirigiri was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, <i><b>Mukuro</b></i>, if we're going to get close, let's talk about some interesting photo's I have some into lately.\" The tone itself spoke leagues about what Kirigiri had planned. The ball was in her court now and she was dammed if anyone was going to take it from her. This was Kirigiri's endgame; everyone was gone now, Junko was tied up, and she had plenty of time to get some answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, let's discuss some things.

Tsumiki's loyalty to you is obvious, and I can hazard a guess as to how you convinced Kuzuryu to steal my evidence once, but I'm curious as to how you got Ms. Ikusaba on your side. You two are about as opposite as night and day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? Gawd, of course we're like that! When are siblings ever <b>not</b> completely different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective's pupils dilated. \"You two are related? Why didn't the academy have record of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mastermind laughed. \"Honey, I've got more connections than a theoretical merging of the CIA and KGB, flubbing the school's database to say what I want is child's play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well, that covers the 'who' and the 'how',\" Kirigiri pointed a finger directly at her. \"Now how about you finally explain the 'why'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko began acting coy again. \"And why would I ever do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective balled her fists. This was starting to get irksome. \"Because you'll go to jail if you don't, or have you forgotten that already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I haven't forgotten. And now that you mention it, spending some time in the can might be fun! I could pay off the judge to get a really short sentence, and I'm sure I could arrange for my dearest Tsumiki to make some 'visits'. It'll be like a vacation, only with more orange!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri bit her lip. <i>Damn, I hadn't thought she would be so willing to go to jail... I'll have to try another tactic to coax the answer out of her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so quick to throw your reputation away. After all, who would follow a convicted criminal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahahaha! Oh, you're so naive it's precious!\" She altered her voice to sound more similar to the detective. \"'Look at me! When I grow up I want to be a policewoman! Establishment is cool! Just say no to drugs, kids!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was the detective's turn to smile. \"... So that's it, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? What's it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your motivation for starting this whole fat incident is starting to become clear. You're a serial non-conformist, aren't you? You hate the fact that society doesn't turn out how you want it so you pettily try and alter it according to your wishes. Someone probably picked on you for being fat as a kid, so instead of actually making the effort to lose weight, you'd rather drag everyone down with you by turning obesity into a fad and tempting our classmates into losing their self control. You're just another self-absorbed teen destined to self destruct. In the end you'll have no more impact than any other angsty member of the youth, and society will continue along the same trends that it always has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile grew wider. \"Tell me I'm wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko matched her. \"Dead wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective wouldn't be dissuaded so easily. \"Don't try to hide the truth now. You've been exposed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I? Remember what I said during our grand confrontation? How every one of my actions stems from the enjoyment of food? Well, I've decided to expand that enjoyment from just myself to as many people as possible! People are so afraid of what others will think if they have a second cookie or go out to eat one time too many during the week! Just think how much more euphoric their lives would be if they could just break through the social prison society has built around them and eat whatever the fuck they wanted all day everyday? I'm on a mission Kiri, I'm not just changing the world for myself, (though I'm totally enjoying every minute of this) I'm changing it for everyone's benefit! I'm the heroine of this tale, you're just a speed bump on the highway of my triumph!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence filled the room for a few seconds. The whole time, the smile never left the detective's face. She took a content breath before she spoke again. \"Got you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, I am still in cuffs. Offer still stands by the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed her folder shut. \"You just confessed to me your real plan. I realized that you were so full of yourself that if I were to wrongly deduce your intent, you wouldn't be able to resist proving to me how wrong I was. Now that you have done so, I've come to fully understand the reasoning behind this whole plan of your's. Now I'll be able to tell the whole school of your plot, and this farce can finally come to an end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri had anticipated some sort of extreme reaction from Junko, but what happened next wasn't what she had in mind. The mastermind began laughing uncontrollably. It was a laugh of a woman possessed, one that shook the detective to the very core of her person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Hahahaha! Oh man, you are good! I was honestly starting to think that a wet sack of flour could out think you- fuck, was I wrong! But none of that matters. Your greatest triumph over me will in the end be for naught! Do you know why? Because even though you know the truth, no one will believe you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure the school will take my side over someone who hid behind others the whole time.\" Kirigiri continued to smile, she even started sounding smug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the best part though! It doesn't matter if I lied to everyone, because all of those people still like me more than they do you! Face it, Kiri, you're a loser! All the students at this school have only ever tolerated you at best! And you just drove the only two who ever even pretended to give a damn about you away for good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color from Kirigiri's face suddenly began to fade. \"Y-you're wrong! I know I hurt Asahina, but if I apologize then I know she'll forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure, maybe under normal circumstances. But while I was here catching up on my beauty sleep, my girl Tsumiki's been picking at the wounds you left on her heart; making sure that you two- and by extension, Naegi as well, will never be friends again. After all, who's the boy gonna listen to? You? Or the love of his life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbject horror suddenly took root in Kirigiri's heart. She immediately ran out of the room, unable to refute the mastermind's words without going to the scene herself. As she departed, Junko laughed, pleased in her victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better hurry, Kiri! I imagine that things are just staring to get interesting...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The drive up was probably one of the longest drives of her life, as all she could think about were Junko's words. The mastermind once again proving to be able to move her pieces, even when Kirigiri thought this was checkmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Better hurry, Kiri! I imagine that things are just staring to get interesting...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gloves hands gripped the steering wheel harder as it pressed int her enlarged gut while she drive the car towards the others; she'd called in some favors with the police to borrow a police car and currently she was blasting down the road at 95 with it's lights on; she just couldn't be bothered to slow down for what was clearly Junko's revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How could I be so stupid as to forget about Tsumiki, she and Junko have been together since the beginning. Ever since Tsumiki started to blow up, everything has gone to hell.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly the two were together, but once again, Kirigiri had put the case before her friends, she'd left them alone with Junko's partner and now Tsumiki could turn everything on her, ruining any chance at being with Naegi and destroying whatever friendship with Asahina there still was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrifting to a stop outside the hotel and getting her belly unstuck from the steering wheel,  Kirigiri threw her weight out of the car and began to waddle towards the doors to the building, preying she wasn't too late. Arriving at them, she nearly blasted them off their hinges as she stepped into the building, only to find the smirking face of Tsumiki and the angry glare of Asahina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" came the near whisper from her lips as she read the situation almost instantaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kirigiri, I think it's time we sat down for a little... chat,\" came the almost ice cold voice of Asahina as she crossed her thick arms under her enlarged breasts, pushing them up slightly from the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly out of breath from the quick run inside, Kirigiri tried to get her point across to the clearly riled up girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Pant* Asahina! *Pant**pant* You have to listen to me! Tsumiki *Pant*! She's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT!\" Came the angered yell from the swimmer. Instantly all sound seemed to stop as Kirigiri seemed to lose her ability to speak at the anger present in her once friends voice. \"I Don't want to hear it...\" Her voice quieted down to a more normal level as she began to speak her piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were my friend, I thought I could trust you. I ate with you, hung out with you, put my faith in you to not betray he; and what do you do? You stab me in the back! You ignore me and Naegi, you don't support us, and just when I think things are starting to improve, you kiss him...\"  tears were starting to appear in the large swimmers eyes as her glare refused to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asahina...\" Kirigiri was starting to see the side of things from Asahina's view, how bad she must have felt to be neglected and how troubled she must have felt upon seeing her boyfriend being kissed by someone she thought was her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know about your feelings for Naegi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri seemed to gain a 'deer in the headlights' look as she comprehended what Asahina was telling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you liked him, and at one point I would have gladly stepped aside if you had simply confessed to him; but now? You abandoned him, you betrayed me! YOU CHEATED, YOU INSULTED, AND YOU HURT ME MORE THAN YOU COULD EVER UNDERSTAND WITH THAT KISS!\" Her voice was rising as she went through that triad; all her emotions were pouring out of her at this moment, and Kirigiri could do nothing but stand there and take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsumiki told me what you planned to do, how you would have lied like you always do, and how you would have gladly taken another chance at Naegi when I had my back turned. I won't let you ruin this for me and Naegi, I won't let you do this to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point tears had also begun to fall from Kirigiri's eyes as she faced her ex-friend. Sobs had begun to escape her mouth as she took every verbal blow from Asahina; for someone who'd never been really close to others, to have someone you would have considered one of your best friends essentially tear into you like that had hurt her more than any physical blow could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Please</b>, Asahina, please listen to me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear it, Kirigiri.\" Turning her back to her one time friend, she herself couldn't help as tears continued to fall from her eyes, this time not out of anger, but sadness for what she felt she 'had to do'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asahina, don't let it end like this, I beg of you.\" <b>Despair </b>seemed to flood her being as she seemed ready to fall to her knees, her pale face almost empty at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking this as her cue to move in for the finishing blow, Tsumiki walked over to Asahina, and once more playing the part of the concerned friend, she laid her hands on her friends shoulders, giving her a large armed hug, their larger forms smooching together while Kirigiri felt like she was now truly at her lowest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should just leave,\" came Asahina's slightly muffled voice from the hug.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her whole body trembled as Asahina's words settled in her ears. This couldn't be it. She had to say something- anything that might get through to Aoi just how sorry she truly was about this whole affair. How sorry she was that she had ignored her for months to relentlessly pursue this case, and how sorry she was that she had let her feelings get the better of her even after the boy she loved had gotten together with her best friend. If she had just been honest with herself... If she had just been willing to confess her feelings to both of them before this whole mess started, none of this would have happened. But she put it off, and instead of being happy for her two closest companions, she tried to interject and reveal her love; hurting both of them in the process. Her hesitance had set up all the pins, and Junko and Tsumiki had just knocked them all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay, Hina.\" Tsumiki began cooing comforting words into the swimmer's ears. \"W-why don't we go get some donuts and take a dip in the springs? You deserve something nice after dealing with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the nurse's words may have sounded kind, to Kirigiri they just twisted the knife of her despair deeper into her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Tsumiki!\" The detective blurted out as the two girls began to depart. Rational thought had abandoned the detective, causing her to frantically grasp at whatever thoughts she could form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- Why? Why are you so devoted to her? She's insane! You have to know that her plan would never work and will only hurt everyone it influences! What drove you to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki giggled. A laugh one might utter when they have heard something completely absurd. \"Whatever are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like she's blaming you for her mistakes. Really, Kiri. I thought you were a better person than that. I guess this week has proven otherwise.\" Asahina's voice turned bitter.  \"C'mon, 'Miki, let's get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective felt her resolve shatter further. The weight of her impending loss dragging her down to her knees as she watched the two of them leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>N-no... Can't you see? I... I never...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everyone okay in here? I thought I heard shouting-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri's heart skipped a beat. Her head slowly spun around to see Naegi walking down the western hallway towards them. He stopped in his tracks as he noticed who was kneeling in the middle of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What are you doing here, Kirigiri? I thought you decided to stay back at the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi!\" She shouted, her mind going a mile a minute now. \"Naegi, please! You have to listen to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucky student tensed up as the gravity of the situation hit him. \"Wait, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Kiri and I had a talk. She was just leaving.\" Asahina turned to her boyfriend, a deeply pained expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened further. \"A-Aoi! What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\" She took a deep breath, trying to hold back further tears. \"I really don't want to talk about it right now... Just... please tell me you're cool with hanging out with me for the rest of the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, of course.\" He nodded. \"Whatever you want to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Kirigiri begged. \"Naegi! I've uncovered everything! The girl we thought was Mukuro was really Junko, and she has a perverse obsession with dragging people into unbridled indulgence! Her whole plan revolves around us not knowing we're falling for her influence; but now that we know her plan we can reveal the truth to everyone and prevent her from doing further damage! But that's not all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent forward and took up a begging position. \"I know this case consumed me. I ignored both you and Asahina just to prove that no investigation would stump me. I was so occupied I had not noticed that your relationship had changed, and in my surprise I committed a worse crime against the both of you. For that, I am sorry, and will be sorry forevermore. If you could find it in your hearts to give me another chance. I would gladly do anything to prove myself worthy of your continued companionship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room fell silent for several minutes. At last, Asahina turned to her, a single tear running down her face as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm sorry, Kiri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needn't hear more. Those three words were all she needed to hear to know their friendship was over. With no more tears to cry, her mind went blank and she entered a zombie like state. She thoughtlessly crawled over to a nearby wall and forced herself to her feet, before slowly trudging out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirigiri-\" Naegi attempted to call after her, but a sudden hug from behind robbed him of his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" Asahina began to cry again into his shoulder. \"Don't go after her. Stay here with me... Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi almost went limp in her arms. He knew things had gotten bad, but this was a whole new level. Kirigiri had just poured her heart into an apology, and it was clear as day that her desire to make amends was sincere. At the same time though, Asahina seemed to have been hurt further by her arrival here tonight, and he couldn't make a fair judgement about it until he had heard her side of the story. He owed it to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.\" He returned her hug. \"It's okay, I'm here for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi smiled at him through her tears. \"Thank you, Naegi. This means a lot to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought him in for a kiss. \"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned her smile, albeit still unsettled by what had just occurred. \"I love you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki lay spread across her bed, having parted ways with Naegi and Asahina shortly after the fight to give them some much needed alone time. A tingling high rushed over her as she thought about just how well her lover's plan had went. She had played the part well, and now not only would Junko shower her with praise, but also Asahina saw her as a true friend and she could now enjoy both of their companies uninterrupted by the prodding detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached behind her pillowcase and pulled out a gift box of exotic chocolates that Junko had sent to help her 'keep her girlish figure.' She joyfully stuffed one after the other in her mouth, allowing the rush of coco, caramel, peanut butter, almonds, and sweet cream build up her elation even further. Once the box had been emptied, she revealed a second, stuffing herself to the max in a sort of ritualistic tribute to the girl who had given her everything. Once she knew she couldn't eat any more, she struggled momentarily to retrieve her cellphone from the night stand, before grasping hold of it and pressing the speed dial for the number Junko had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! How's my favorite gal doing?\" Junko's peppy voice echoed from the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just wonderful!\" Tsumiki felt like singing. She hadn't been this excited in ages!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha. I'm glad to here that. I take it that the latest step in our plan has been accomplished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki didn't need to see the costume changes anymore, she could tell when Junko was switching personas just by the tone of her voice. \"It went off perfectly! Asahina completely distrusts Kirigiri and Naegi is too conflicted to dig into it deeper! We've won! We've won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ah! Don't celebrate just yet, my dear. While Kirigiri might have been thrown out of the equation, we still have a few more moves to make before we can declare victory. First thing's first, I think it's time that Aoi and I had a little heart to heart. Why don't you convince her to come meet with me once your vacation is over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Tsumiki nodded. \"It'll be easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a chuckle on the other end. \"I never doubted you for a minute, my sweet. You've really out done yourself this time, so I've prepared a very special reward for you. It's your's as soon as you bring Ms. Asahina in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki's pulse elevated as her mind raced in wonder about what her lover might have in store for her. \"T-thank you! I can't wait to know what it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I know you'll enjoy it. Sleep well, my dear, for you shall return to my side soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone went dead, and yet the nurse could still here her words in her head clear as day. She quickly locked her door and closed the blinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, Junko...</i> Her face went completely red as she slid her underwear down her legs. She was far too excited to sleep. She needed some way to release the feelings of delight building with in her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And she knew exactly how she would go about doing it.</span></div></div>",

Following the crushing events of the previous night she'd almost mindlessly drove back to her room, her face devoid of all emotion and feeling. She seemed to simply exist in a state of emptiness as she arrived back at the school and began to make her way back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking Junko normally would have been at the top of her list, but some voice in the back of her mind told her that the mastermind had already long since been freed, perhaps by the real Mukuro. It didn't even matter now Junko had won; she played her and tossed her out when she was done providing entertainment. Looking back, she never had a chance at victory in the first place. She was destined to fail at this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd arrived back at her room, she'd placed an order for several dozen snack foods for her to eat while she wallowed in her despair. When the food had arrived, she'd stripped off all her clothes and had begun to dig in, her appetite doing its best to fill the void in her heart left by her one time friends. Slice after slice of pizza disappeared into her naked gut while candy bars of various kinds joined burgers and wings inside her stomach. Laying atop her sheets and not caring about her modesty, she continued to stuff, letting out soft moans as she did so, images of Naegi flashing through her mind as she dug into her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the small feast of junk food she'd ordered, she wiped her hands on a pair of dirty shorts before she began to satisfy another part of her that for the first time in years was acting up and calling to her. Twenty minutes later, that particular itch having been scratched, she crawled under the covers and drifted to sleep, her mind trying to grasp at something for her to hold onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe tomorrow will be a better day...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of buttons being mashed and soft chatter was what awoke the hefty girl from her slumber, as her mind tried to make sense of what was going on around her. As her eyes slowly opened, she saw a blurry figure in a green jacket sitting by her bedside, a 3ds in their hands. Eyes snapping open at the thought of Naegi returning to her, that thought was instantly derailed as Kirigiri spied the figure sitting beside her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe appeared similar to Naegi, same sense of fashion with that green jacket, same figure, and same facial features, but the demeanor and hair were drastically different from her... Asahina's Naegi. For one where Naegi seemed to act rather nervous, this boy seemed to be rather more confident in his posture, his hair was also almost white, with just a little bit of color towards the back of it. Whoever he was, his resemblance to Naegi was uncanny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, tearing his eyes away from the game screen, put his focus on Kirigiri and seemed to give a rather warm grin towards her. Something that seemed to unnerve her for some reason in the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kirigiri, I was <b>hoping </b>he would have the chance to talk.\" came the boys rather polite tone of voice as he got out of his chair and turned away from the girl, facing out the window of her room. \"I was hoping to talk to you earlier, but I wasn't able to get in touch due to various... issues these past few weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of bed herself, Kirigiri pulled on a pair of overtaxed panties and a bra in a similar situation, struggling to put them on and ignoring the sounds of threads tearing slightly, she spoke up once she was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring Kirigiri was nor presentable, the teen turned around and gave a bow to the rotund girl before speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Nagito Komaeda, and I have a proposal for you...\"</span></div></div>",

Adorning the table were over three dozen freshly baked donuts and an assortment of breakfast beverages both hot and cold alike. The last few days of their vacation had passed her by in a happy dreamlike state, filled with food and fun with the new friends she had made. Asahina had particularly latched on to her as a friend whom she could share thoughts and feelings with that she wasn't comfortable sharing with Naegi, and Tsumiki was reveling in the thought that she was needed. At some deep level she felt bad for having to put her friend through so much pain in order to defeat Kirigiri, but now that she was out of the picture, she wanted to make it up to her; to prove that she could be a better friend than the detective ever was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn automatic glass door opened, and a slightly gloomy Asahina stepped out onto the balcony. Despite her naturally energetic and cheery demeanor, all the emotional upheaval she had had to endure in the past week had really taken the wind out of her sails so to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-good morning, Aoi.\" The nurse waved to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, 'Miki.\" She forced a smile for her friend, but it was quite obvious to anyone who watched her trudge forward that joy was something she was not feeling at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got us some breakfast!\" Tsumiki gestured at the sugary spread before her, deciding to compensate for her friend's dour mood with a level of energy uncommon for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks.\" The fat swimmer hefted her weight into an open chair, the clouds of her depression lightening somewhat upon seeing her favorite food. She grabbed a hold of a large maple bar and crammed it in her face, before loading the plate in front of her with several others from the wide selection in front of her as she chewed. Tsumiki joined her in the feast, carefully cherry picking out all of her preferred chocolate glazed donuts before partaking as well. Before long all three boxes and the accompanying jugs of fluid had been emptied, leaving the girls contently stuffed. Asahina took a minute to allow her meal to settle before speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, 'Miki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" the nurse responded as she finished wiping chocolate stains off of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanna say thanks. I know I kind of dragged everyone around me down with my personal problems while we were supposed to be on vacation, but you were totally cool with me venting to you the entire time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was nothing. Really.\" Tsumiki smiled sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi returned her smile. \"Hey, come on. Take some credit for being a good friend once in awhile...\" She suddenly looked away from the nurse, gazing off into the sunrise as her body tensed up. \"...You've been more deserving of it that someone else was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still thinking about what Kirigiri said?\" The nurse asked, though the answer was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahina sighed dejectedly. \"It's not just that she tried to steal Naegi from me behind my back, but she also tried to somehow blame you for this whole thing! I can't remember everything she said, but it sounded like she thought you were part of some big conspiracy to ruin her and everyone else's figure.\" She scowled, before patting her prominent stomach. \"I know a lot of us have gotten a little chunky lately, but I mean really? What kind of scheme is that? I just think she's fishing for people to blame for her own shortcomings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe you're right.\" Tsumiki nodded in agreement. \"I know it may be hard given how long you've known each other, but-but I think it would be best if you try and forget about Kirigiri for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swimmer sighed again. \"Yeah...\" She turned back to face the table. \"I just need something to help me take my mind off this whole mess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twinkle suddenly shone in Tsumiki's eyes. <i>Perfect...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, since we don't have class today, would you like to join me to meet up with someone after this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? Is it that one black haired girl who wore two sets of glasses at once from the eating contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Tsumiki nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi scratched her head in thought for a moment. \"Didn't you like declare your love for her to the whole school the last time we saw her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki's face went beet red and she clutched her face in her hands. \"Ehehehehehehehe... when you put it like that it sounds so embarrassing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoi leaned forward a bit, as if the wham line of some juicy gossip was about to be dropped. \"Does that mean you actually do like her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse made a wide smile, her face no less red. \"Mmhmm! I guess that makes me kind of a freak, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swimmer got up and gave her a reassuring pat on the shoulder. \"Pssh, don't worry about it. If it works for you than it's cool with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki hugged her from her seat, wrapping her arms around her wide, plush middle. \"Th-thanks, Aoi. That means a lot to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Now, let's go meet this person of your's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki led Asahina to the very back of the kitchen to where the elevator to Junko's underground base was hidden. She waved to a camera mounted in the corner, and the doors to the lift opened soon afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahina blinked in surprise. \"Woah! I know your friend said she was rich, but this is some CIA stuff for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki giggled. \"Maybe she just likes having privacy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... but I'm getting the feeling that this girl is a bit far from normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's not normal at all She's beyond extraordinary!\" Tsumiki cheered as she pressed the button to take them downwards. The machine began to grind to life, and within a second they were plummeting down deep below the school. As the elevator docked at its destination, its doors swung open. Asahina was shocked to discover the hidden fortress of luxury that dwelled right below the nose of the students. The floor space was huge and covered with a red carpet, itself dotted with over a dozen large sized sofas and tables. Colossal display screens lined each of the walls, allowing one to get a good view no matter where they were sitting. The thing the swimmer noticed the most though was an intoxicating aroma of delicious baked goods; one strong enough to cause her to salivate with desire despite the fact that they had both just stuffed themselves to the brim not an hour earlier,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spotlight appeared over her and Tsumiki's head as they stepped into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Ms. Asahina. It's a pleasure to finally have the chance to be introduced to you properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother spotlight shone down on the opposite side of the room. A large and ornate office chair swung around to reveal the corpulent form of Junko Enoshima, the light causing a sheen effect on the glasses she currently worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahina was taken aback by the amount of detail that was going into this introduction. \"Uh, wow... and you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"I am Junko Enoshima. Please, Ms. Asahina, take a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse and swimmer strode over to the sofa set nearest to her arm chair. Aoi immediately felt more at ease as she slumped into the nicest seat she had ever sat in, enjoying how she sunk into it slightly. \"Heh, no need to be so formal. Just Asahina or Aoi is fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mastermind nodded. \"Very well then. I bet you're wondering about how or why I have such an elaborate setup down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda, yeah...\" Asahina rubbed the back of her head kind of nervously. \"I'm starting to get the feeling that Kirigiri might have been on to something when she accused you of being some sort of evil overlord...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko laughed. \"Nothing could be farther from the truth. The good detective learned of me and thought me a devil, but I assure you I have nothing other than noble intentions.\" She paused and prodded her middle. \"As you can plainly see, I am quite fat, and have been so since I was a small child. This caused me to be the subject of much bullying throughout most of my life, all just because I didn't fit what people wanted me to be. So I have decided to devote my life to aiding those who have been bullied for similar reasons, and to teach the world that there's nothing wrong about being on the heavy side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, that's actually a hella nice thing to do.\" Asahina smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you agree. You see, a key part of my plan to normalize obesity in society is to remove people's reservations about indulging as they desire and the obsession with dieting. So I am trying to start a group so to speak at this school where girls can just lounge around and be at ease with themselves as they enjoy what society has denied them. If you'd like, you could be a part of that group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahina thought about it for a moment, before she gave her answer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, if it means helping people and hanging out with my friends, then I'm for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko chuckled. \"Excellent. Welcome to the team, Asahina.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The whole situation seemed very strange from an outsiders point of view, a shocked half naked girl standing before a bowing albino student made for quite a picture. However to those present this was quite possibly one of the most pivotal moments in their lives, something that could have drastic consequences if left untouched. However the drama was sadly ruined when Kirigiri broke the silence to question what she'd just been told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but what?\" These were the first of many questions to come to her mind as she went over what she'd been asked by the strange boy before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say it again, I need your help in taking down Junko Enoshima.\" Once more the boy's voice and demeanor didn't give anything away, a trait Kirigiri once held before the events of these past few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all seemed to surreal to her that the enlarged beauty had to take a seat for this; leaning back onto her bed, she took a seat once more, honestly feeling winded from the shock of that proposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Of all the things she wanted to tell him, to scream at him, this was the one thing she could let escape her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would she go back into the lions den? Why would she risk the climb once more? Why would she subject herself to whatever torture Enoshima would put her thought for daring to play one more round with her? She'd lost, it had been an uphill battle from the beginning and it had only gotten harder as she fought; in the end she'd been crushed and had lost far more than she'd ever thought she could. It was over, and yet his guy wanted her to go though that again?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told you were the best out there when it came to solving cases; that you were a machine that wouldn't rest until the case was solved? You were made to be the Holmes of the new generation and yet here you are; I don't know what I was told, but you aren't what I was <b>hoping </b>for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow dare he. How dare he act all high and mighty with his remarks, like he knew what she had suffered at Junko's hands, how the girl had twisted her, manipulated her, and finally broken her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would be the one to help me, but clearly I was wrong; hell, the only help I cold probably get from you is help with directions to the buffet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wet slap echoed through the room as a hand print was left on Komaeda's face from Krigiri's slap. Said girl was now shaking with rage, looking ready to kill the albino student for his remarks. Instead though, she chose to speak out, and with each work venom was directed towards the white haired boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T you fucking dare say another word... You have no idea what I've given for this case. My friends, my reputation, my body,\" at this she grabbed two handfuls of belly fat and gave them several jiggles, sending waves over her body. it was quite a statement to how out of shape she'd gotten by how her boy continued to jiggle a few moments after she'd stopped shaking her fat rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've given all I can, and I can't Fucking STAND it anymore! I have <b>NOTHING </b>right now, I don't have any <b>friends</b>, I don't have any <b>skills</b>, I don't even have any motivation to get out of bed anymore because that <b>FUCKING </b>Tsumiki screwed me over!\" By the end of her rank she was panting heavily and rosy cheeked, her letting out of steam probably having been the most exercise she'd done in a while aside from walking. Already she was beginning to perspire as her anger began to fade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was silent on Komaeda's end as he took all of this without even flinching; for a solid minute neither student moved before with a sigh and a lean back, Komaeda began to spin his tale to the enlarged girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It all started with Tsumiki...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly calming down from her rage educed tantrum, the fattened girl took a seat on the edge of her bed, her eyes focusing for a second on the name, wondering just what kind of connection the white haired boy before her had with the larger than life nurse who had become one of her most hated enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was born rather sick, that's probably to be expected considering my luck, and soon after birth I was diagnosed with lymphoma. Later as I went through treatment, I contracted frontotemporal dementia. The pain was present, but what made things worse was that it isolated me when i was growing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll rage seemingly forgotten, Kirigiri was entirely focused on the boy's story, wondering just where it would end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sickness' kept me rather lonely until a few years ago, I arrived in this city, where I had a lonely nurse to take care of me. She looked after me, talked to me, and although I couldn't really talk back much, seeing as I was more of a loner than her, I could relate to her without issue. We wouldn't talk much, and when I found out she was going to an academy for the unique and interesting, I had to join her. Because of my luck, I was accidentally given a copy of a title, making me the second 'lucky' student to grace these halls this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widening at this students story, his character was already shaping up rather nicely, as she pieced together just who was standing before him. Where as Naegi's Good Luck title was given to him because of a lottery, the student before her had legitimately earned his title through natural skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then came the day she disappeared, Tsumiki, the girl who'd given me such <b>hope, </b>at first I thought she was going through a rough patch, I'd kept my distance from her so she could adjust to the school, but after her disappearance, she was changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri could begin to see bits of madness begin to creep into Komaeda's voice as he began to string together his next few sentences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She lied... she <b>twisted </b>others... she <b>changed </b>so much from the girl I use to know... and at the center of it all was <b>Junko Enoshima</b>, playing her like a doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKomaeda, despite the anger rolling off of him and the insane look in his eyes, seemed to regain a bit of himself as he pulled out a pill bottle from his pocket and popped a few multicolored pills into his mouth. As he swallowed them, the calm demeanor seemed to return as he breathed in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enoshima changed her, and because of her everything that's been happening in this school to the girl's waists has been orchestrated through Tsumiki. If Enoshima was to fall today, Tsumiki would take all the blame, Enoshima would just seem like a victim of Tsumiki's fat obsession.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Komaeda was saying did make a lot of sense, Junko had done everything through Tsumiki, Junko clearly was smart enough to have everything point back to Tsumiki, and with a few fake tears she would be sent along her way, seen as a victim rather than as a mastermind. Still though, there were still pieces that needed to be placed before she could even think about taking another shot at Enoshima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why now? Why are you coming to me now after everything that's happened?\" Had she had a partner like Komaeda, things could have been so much easier, his apparent drive to get Junko clearly would have helped in the past. She could still have been with Naegi... and Asahina had he been present!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junko had you understood the moment you stood in her way; she knew everything about you from your blood pressure to your panty size, both of which I see she took liberties with changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few of her blankets to cover herself a little, not appreciating the fat shot to her pride, she still paid attention to Komaeda's ploy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She thinks you're done; your spirit is broken and you don't have the energy to fight her anymore. She expects you to be a complaint pig, only going out to get to classes and spending the rest of your time in your room, stuffing yourself until you're too fat to move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Immobility briefly went though Kirigiri's mind as she imagined herself trapped by her own fat, her own fat keeping her restrained as she jiggled from the slightest movements; oddly though the thought became instantly more appealing as an image of Naegi climbing her rolls of fat to feed her went through her mind. Eventually though she snapped out of her rather lewd thoughts and back to Komaeda's explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thus she won't be expecting you to fight back, especially with a partner sine she believed she has isolated you from the student body. Before you ask; no, I wasn't seen coming here, by camera's or students, I was just <b>lucky</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling was burning inside her that she hadn't believed possible after the events of last night; the despair that once clouded her mind now seemed to fade as a new feeling became present in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling a rather vicious smirk towards the grinning Komaeda, she asked the question she was dying to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the school, as the three large beauties prepared to dig into their feast, they had no idea what was coming for them; after all, there's nothing scarier than someone who has nothing left to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh believe me, I believe the punishment for them will be... Fitting, to say the least.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still grinning, Komaeda began pacing along a small length of wall, seemingly growing more excited with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so obvious now... Enoshima must have spent countless hours scheming on how to stop people from stopping her. I mean, just look at how easily she was able to crush you! Everyone at this school is a brilliant beacon of <b>hope</b>, but you above all others were destined to save the world from diabolical masterminds such as her; and yet, it was hardly a competition at all from her perspective!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit of Kirigiri's enthusiasm wavered at being reminded of her defeat again. \"Yes, yes. I failed to bring her down by challenging her directly, I'm guessing your plan must involve fighting her on a different front?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe albino student giggled. \"Oh no! We're not going to fight her at all!\" He paused for dramatic effect, before closing his eyes and smiling the fullest smile possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe're going to give her exactly what she wants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\" The detective was beginning to wonder if her investigatory genius had abandon her, as Komaeda had completely lost her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" The second Ultimate Luck student scratched the side of his head. \"I'm sorry, did I not get my point across clearly enough? I thought it was fairly straightforward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard what you said, but I don't understand why you said it. I thought you wanted to get revenge on Junko for corrupting Tsumiki, not surrender to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said anything about surrendering? Haven't you ever heard of the phrase 'too much of a good thing'? Think about it. Enoshima lives to eat and loves to win, right now I imagine she's celebrating your defeat the only way she knows how: By eating more food than should be humanly possible. She's delighted to stuff herself silly and watch herself and those loyal to her blimp up, so I think it may be in our best interest if we let her do just that; in fact, I say we should encourage it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri's eyes widened in realization. \"...You're suggesting that we sew the seeds of her own destruction by encouraging her to fatten herself to the point that she can't carry out her own plans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct!\" Komaeda applauded her deduction skills. \"Imagine! Her whole plan collapsing in on itself through her own hedonism! Chained down by her own weight while her followers are too busy wallowing in sin to carry out orders! Hahahahaha...\" He paused to take a breath. \"A fitting end for such a self-obsessed villain, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri brought a hand to her chin and stroked it in thought. \"...Usually, I don't believe in resorting to a criminal's tactics, but as it isn't illegal and taking her down properly didn't work, this may be our only way of defeating her for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKomaeda bowed again. \"It moves me deeply to here my plan praised so, I take it you're in then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, causing some of the accumulated fat around her face to shake slightly. \"I still have a few more questions. First, even as fat as she is now, making Junko immobile would require years of not decades of excess indulgence, who knows how far Junko's insane plan would progress by then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I thought about that. Normally, making someone so fat so quickly would be impossible; but we are the students of hope's peak academy, <b>Nothing</b> is beyond our reach! Before our meeting I made contact with some friends of mine: One an Ultimate Cook, whose talent speaks for itself and the other an Ultimate Yakuza, with access to all manner of untested and extra-legal substances. Together, they made this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKomaeda retrieved a wrapped ball of butcher paper, unrapping it to retrieve a single cinnamon bun, its gooey frosting partially fusing with its surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing there's more to this than meets the eye?\" She inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! You see, this humble cinnamon bun has been chemically altered to do three things: Lower one's metabolism while simultaneously speeding up digestion, trigger hunger receptors in the brain, and be absolutely delicious! Once Junko eats this, she'll always be too hungry and too lazy to do anything other than eat while her body packs on the pounds at a rate never thought possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mad twinkle entered his eyes again. \"And I've put in a request for my associates to produce these in the hundreds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri was stunned. She knew Komaeda was dedicated to brining Junko down, but she hadn't expected him to cook up something so elaborate this far in advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I see you've put quite a bit of thought into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! If I'm to attend this school, I must prove to all that I am worthy to bask in it's glory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was again. Kirigiri could tell that Komaeda was smart, but he also seemed to be possessed of a certain zealotry with regards to Hope's Peak Academy. While by no means bad, she might need to think of a plan to keep his... eccentric tendencies in check to make sure everything remained under the radar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri narrowed her eyes.\"...So, you're sure that these other two can be trusted to keep quiet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a mouse!\" He replied gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're fine with Tsumiki going down with her as well? If you start mass producing these things, Junko's likely to make her eat them as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly looked down towards the ground, his mirth replaced with a look of wistfulness. \"...Up until recently, I'd never thought of doing anything that might hurt her. She used to be so fragile and filled with good intentions... maybe she could go back to the way she was once Junko's gone, given enough time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up from the ground, a serious expression on his face as he locked eyes with the detective. \"But defeating Enoshima comes first. If Tsumiki gets caught in the crossfire, then I'll just have to repay my debt and take care of her once she can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" The detective closed her eyes in thought. She had spent so much time resenting the nurse it was odd to hear her being described as a once decent, even kind person. Thankfully, it sounded as though Komaeda wouldn't let his past feelings toward her get in the way of what needed to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any more questions?\" The albino asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one: What is to be my role in this plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile returned. \"Listen closely...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko lounged in her luxurious office chair as the five guests she had invited for the evening's events exited the elevator. Exiting the elevator, from left to right, were Mukuro, Asahina, Tsumiki, and, unexpectedly, Sonia and Owari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mastermind smiled, her glasses glimmering under the overhead lights. \"Ah, welcome girls. Thank you for accepting my invitation to my little soiree tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Sonia beamed. \"When I was told that someone had built a hidden evil lair under the school, I just had to come investigate it! And I must say, the combination of a decadent interior with innumerable cameras and monitors is just classic! I can imagine a brilliant mass murderer with an air of nobility calling this place home; tracking his prey in perfect comfort until the time is right to strike!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwari scratched her head. \"Man, watcha talking about? I was just told there was going to be free food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mastermind chuckled. \"And there will be. Behold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of her fingers, a pulley system lifted a centrally placed curtain, revealing a pair of cushy sofas placed around a long dark wooden table laden with four kinds of meat and fish, a veritable sea of sushi, five different kinds of pies and cakes, enough french bread and pasta to stock a bakery, two punch bowls of Jello, and at the center of it all a tower of chocolate dipped donuts that was at least a full building floor tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwari grinned and cracked her knuckles in the process. \"Aw yeah, that's what I'm talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and the other invitees made their way over to the banquet before them and took their seats, each sampling from the plethora of food offered to them according to their own tastes. Owari focused on the variety of meats, Tsumiki and Asahina went straight for the deserts with the latter beginning to work on dismantling the donut tower, and Sonia, still new to Japan and interested in Japanese cuisine, began sampling the various kinds of sushi rolls before her. Mukuro, as expected, took little, something Junko noted with some annoyance. Now wasn't the time to start something with her sister though, she had a more important matter at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone.\" Junko raised a glass of sparkling cider. \"I'd like to propose a toast to the guest of honor tonight: Aoi Asahina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swimmer blushed slightly as attention was levied at her. \"Oh, uh... Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is I who should be thanking you. With your help, I'm sure we could teach the whole world that there's nothing wrong with enjoying oneself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny hidden meaning within that statement lost to her, Asahina simply nodded in agreement as she continued to dig into some of the best donuts she had ever experienced in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You know, I think I'm gonna like hanging down here. 'Miki's girlfriend is pretty cool.</i> Aoi thought contently as a wave of enjoyment washed over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alarm on one of her personal monitors suddenly caught the mastermind's attention. Turning away from the glorious feast in front of her, the mastermind turned her attention to her personal spy network throughout the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gah, what is it now?</i> Junko mused as she opened a live video window.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite knowing that this was all part of the plan, Kirigiri couldn't help but feel a bad taste in her mouth for having to go through with this part of the plan. Even though the fat detective was agreeing to Komaeda's plan, to have to go up to what had become her most hated enemy and give her what she wanted was almost sickening. Still, as the door to Junko's secret hideout opened up and the large figure of Junko appeared, the smell of a recent meal caught Kirigiri's nose as a small rumble in her belly sounded. Despite that, she steeled herself and prepared to spew as much BS as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko meanwhile was thinking long and hard about the arrival of Kirigiri a her hideout; of course with the news of such a place becoming knowledgeable around the girls with larger frames, it was only a matter of time before the detective heard such rumors, she just wasn't expecting Kirigiri to show up on her front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the mastermind looked over the small (in comparison) girl before her, she began to study her posture and follow her eye movements; take in the fact that behind her looked to be a large cart of fresh cinnamon rolls and you the pieces were fitting into place. Instantly adopting a crown on top of her head as her personality seemed to switch to one befitting such a scene, Junko could only let out a rather haughty laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what bring little Kirigiri to my hideout. I'll admit I wasn't expecting dinner and a show, but if you're feeling in the mood for another beating then by all means, show me what you've got!\" Letting out another haughty laugh, Kirigiri had to restrain herself from punching the insane whale before her, Junko knew the moment she saw her she wasn't there for a fight; she knew that if Kirigiri wanted to fight she'd have brought a lot more than pastries to the battle of wits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, putting on her best face of defeat, the girl drooped her head and allowed the mastermind to finish up her own ego boosting laughter. When the crown finally disappeared from her head, she seemed to return to normal and asked the question she already knew the answer to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what brings you down here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri muttered a couple of words barely audible for the girl to hear, however Junko seemed to almost get the gist of it as her face adopted a blank expression for a moment before her next words came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say that again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Kirigiri's words came out barely audible, this time slightly louder; at this point a wide grin came to Junko's face, an almost Cheshire grin, as if a fat cat had just caught a juicy plump mouse to eat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more time, loud enough for me to hear it this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up into Junko's eyes, Kirigiri's face was one showcasing utter defeat, complete submission, a look Junko loved to see in those close to her and almost immediately her face showed something akin to ecstasy as Kirigiri's words reached her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You win...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYES! This was what she wanted, and but had Kirigiri failed to disappoint. To see someone who had dared to stand up to her crumble before her was always such a treat, and Kirigiri who had even managed to deliver a few counter punches in their fight, to finally crumble was greater than any pleasure she'd felt outside of food, every syllable was like sex to her and she adored it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming to remember the fact that she was in front of the surce of her arousal at the moment, Junko decided to continue with their talk and unleash the fires Kirigiri had lit in her once she and Tsumiki had some alone time. Wiping the stream of droll off her chubby cheeks and her double chin, the obese girl once more adopted her analytic persona and adorned her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case, why come down here, I doubt that it was just to deliver that git you just gave me; although the sentiment is appreciated...\" At this her meaty thighs rubbed together and once more a blush adorned her cheeks before the arousal was put on the back burner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her actions doing her talking, Krigiri moved the cart full of cinnamon buns in front of her and allowed their image to enter the eyes of Junko. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you hate people standing up against you; your psychological profile screams god complex, so I figured you would keep tormenting me even after you've won, so I decided to placate you with this, think of it as war reparations. After this, no more fighting, we both go our separate ways, and I don't dare to stand in your way again. I might be able to salvage my friendship with Naegi in the future so if the off chance Aoi decides to leave him, I won't have to worry about you coming after me and ruining my life ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on paper this seemed perfectly sound to Junko; Kirigiri wanted to move on with her life, she was nor (rightfully) afraid of her, and was even offering a tribute to placate her. All and all it seemed perfect; a little too perfect in some places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Could she have poisoned the buns? What if this is all a trap to let my guard down? Would she willingly try to kill me after what I've done?' Thoughts and probabilities flew through her head, hundreds in a single moment before a single thought occurred to her. Test the buns, using Mukuro of course. The girl had plenty of experience dealing with poison and could fight it off long enough to get attention as well as deal with Kirigiri if things turn out that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough a small part of Junko's mind was actually begging the buns to be poisoned, somewhere along the lines Kirigiri had ceased to be an obstacle to her plans and almost something akin to a rival; it was a little sad to see the game between them end. Sadly, all games have to end at some point, and as Junko called over the idle Mukuro, who despite managing to pack on only a few pounds from her stay with her sister (which she'd thankfully managed through exercising and moderation during meal time) was still in very good shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mercenary walked over to her blimp of a sister, Kirigiri had to use all of her training and experience of revealing nothing about her personality to make sure that she didn't show her nervousness. Small sweat began to break out in her once more upgraded and expanded uniform as she watched the soldier girl pick up a cinamon bun on Junko's command and take a bite out of the treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three seconds the girl was eating the longest three seconds of her life as the girl's blank face never revealed anything; finally as she swallowed the spiked treat, Mukuro spoke to her sister, \"it's clean,\" before returning to her position as a sort of guard over her sister's proceedings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing her breath, Kirigiri allowed Junko to take the cart and push it into the room before facing the mastermind once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this probably won't even count as a light snack to you and Tsumiki, so I ordered plenty of them to be delivered to you, every day for the next month or so.\" Receiving a nod from the oddly silent Junko, Kirigiri turned and proceeded back towards the surface so allow Komaeda's plan to unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kirigiri,\" came a strangely sweet vice from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, she saw Junko in another of her personalities, this time a rather chibi and cute persona being what she was using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been fun~!\" Releasing a rather soft squeal of giggles, the obese girl turned back to her hideout and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" came Kirigiri's voice, this time quiet with a hint of disbelief mixed in. \"... you crazy bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the surface, all that was left to do was wait for the plan to unfold and maybe try to fix things with her former friends. Once again she felt confidence as Junko had unknowingly been one upped once more, only this time if things went according to plan she'd be free of Junko's wrath as well as finally defeat her enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope this works...'</span></div></div>",

Muffled snoring could be heard coming from the nurse as her body worked to process the heavy meal she just had. \"That was just incredible! The look of utter defeat on her face, that slouched, defeated posture-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. You beat her.\" Mukuro muttered as she cleaned up a veritable mountain of napkins, wrappers, and other trash left behind from Junko's latest feast a few hours ago. \"Please try and keep your legs crossed while I'm still in the room this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mastermind's elation was suddenly buried under a feeling of annoyance as her lips twisted into a slight frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know sis, you're starting to be a real downer around here.\" She hid her face behind her first two fingers and her thumb. \"I mean, it was funny at first when you were playing the straight man to my lovable wacky antics, but now you're just killing the fun. Like a fun-Nazi, putting all the fun in concentration camps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not here to have fun.\" She scooped a pile of rubbish into a dustpan and dumped it into a large black garbage bag. \"I'm here to do a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that, bitch?\" Junko stuck out her tongue. \"Cause ever since Kiri finally figured out who I really am, you ain't done shit for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier rolled her eyes, long used to such mood swings from here sister. \"You haven't given me an orders since then. I've been stuck in your sexual fantasy basement for over a week now with nothing to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struck a kawii pose. \"Aww... but there's plenty to do around here! You could eat and sleep, and sleep and eat... the least you could do for me is grow a cute little potbelly! Girls look so gross with abs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMukuro sighed, her irritation building. \"For the last time: I am not going to get fat. My abilities as a soldier depend on my physical shape. I would be of no use if I were to let myself go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko blinked and paused momentarily in thought before speaking again. \"You know... you're right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier's expression softened. \"Thank you for seeing reason for once-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're absolutely of no use to me right now!\" She cheered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMukuro contorted inwards, as if she had been physically struck in the chest. \"What are you going on about? Did you even hear what I just said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko chuckled and put her glasses on, before gently nudging Tsumiki awake. \"Sorry to wake you, dearest. Something just crossed my mind that I wanted to share with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm?\" Tsumiki yawned and turned her head upwards to gaze into her lover's eyes. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just felt like telling you how wonderful you've been handling you're assignments lately.\" She smiled and began gently caressing the nurse's still partially bloated stomach. \"You've done so well, and I just loved how you crushed that meddling detective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streamer-haired girl smiled and turned beet red. \"Ehehehe... thanks. It was nothing really, I just did everything you told me to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes, you did.\" The mastermind's voice was slowly becoming more alluring and seductive with each word she uttered. \"You're such a good little follower. My little plan would have never gotten this far without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki began quivering in anticipation as Junko's hand moved lower and began gently massaging the exterior of her vulva. \"T-thank you! I'd do anything- anything for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mastermind's smile widened. \"I know.\" She pushed Tsumiki up into a seating position and decided to skip the introduction entirely; straddling the lap of her smaller partner and pressing her full weight down on top of her. \"And that's why you're perfect! I don't need anyone other than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMukuro's face twisted in horror at the sight before her. She didn't know what was worse: the words coming from her sister's mouth, or the fact that she was currently grinding against someone. She quickly slammed her eyes shut and turned away. Junko had to be doing this to get a rise out of her; to push her buttons hard enough to bully her into submission. Still, even though the soldier knew it was a trap, she couldn't force herself to see through it all the way. She and her sister had been discarded by others many a time. Their family was gone, all of her friends were gone, the only one she had left was her younger, megalomaniac of a sister.To remain connected to her was to play by her rules; and yet, it was the only connection she still had, the only set of rules anyone would let her play by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" The soldier shouted, eventually caving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko ignored her, and pressed down harder against Tsumiki as the fire within her groin burned hotter. Being much more inexperienced with sex than Junko, the nurse was often much quicker to finish, letting out a gasp of ecstasy as the bandages around her thighs became soaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMukuro bit down hard on her lip, drawing a small river of blood. Being ignored was the one thing she hated the most. Incited to act, she stomped over to the delivery tray of cinnamon buns and grabbed a hold of one, shoving the whole thing into her mouth in a single motion. She chewed daftly and swallowed; never really caring for the taste of sweets. When it became clear that Junko would still not acknowledge her she ate another, then another. By the time she had reached her fifth roll she felt as though she was about to retch, and surely would have done so had the sound of her sister's orgasmic release not drawn her complete attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...\" Junko let out one last moan and turned her head over her shoulder to look over at her sister. \"You say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe forced herself to swallow what was currently filling her cheeks. \"...I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mastermind laughed once again. \"I'm glad you finally see the light, dear sister. I'm sure you'll grow to love feeling fat and full just as much as I have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her attention back to her loyal consort, who seemed to be lost in a haze of pleasure. \"Come.\" She lifted her to her feat with some effort. \"Let us go wash up and change into something clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick nod, Tsumiki followed Junko out of the main room to their private bath and bedroom, leaving Mukuro to stand alone with the cart full of cinnamon rolls before her. She stared at the baked goods in contempt, before reaching down to grab a hold of another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You'd better appreciate this, Junko...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbuki slammed her head directly into a tray of nachos and began to eat like a wild animal. Time and trends had certainly had an effect on the young rock star, padding her out so much as to rival the size of her self-proclaimed manager, the Ultimate Imposter. Top heavy was the only way to describe the eccentric girl, with breasts that could easily smother a man and were now far bigger than even Owari's was before she started putting on weight as well. Her belly had also seen considerable growth, pooching out slightly over her lap and threatening to peek out from under her shirt whenever she walked. While her thighs also had some considerable growth, her hips and butt were rather small in comparison to the rest of her; giving her the inverse development of the now decisively pear shaped pop singer, her eternal rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ibuki.\" The white garbed imitator said sternly from the other side of the table. \"While I would never be one to discourage my client, I must insist that you stop eating like a savage this instant. Good food deserves to be eaten with care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm?\" She looked up at her manager, cheese dripping from her whole face as she did so. \"I'm just eating how Ibuki is meant to eat! She's a big pig like you now! Oink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah.\" He crossed his arms. \"Pigs are among the cleanest and most intelligent of all animals. Had they the hands to do so, they would most certainly eat in a much more dignified manner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaagh! You're always too serious!\" She wiped the mess of her face with a napkin. \"Ibuki thinks you need to lighten up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled slightly. \"I promise to have all the fun you want from me once you beat Maizono's group in the upcoming concert duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned his smile ten fold. \"Right! Those mainstream pop losers will crumble before the killer chords of real music!\" <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mukuro reclined further into the seat she had been occupying almost non-stop for the last two weeks; sinking into the heavenly soft cushions as she lazily eyed a news feed about a battle along the border of northern Uzbekistan between a known terrorist cell and her fellow mercenaries. Clad in only her bra and panties- or as her sister like to call it, \"corporate casual\", she reached a hand over to a plate of cinnamon buns that had oh so sweetly been left by her sister this morning in an attempt to \"make her feel more welcome in her new home.\" Oddly though, her hand could only grasp at air. Rolling her head to the right slightly to investigate, she realized that it had already been picked clean by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh... that was fast.</i> She thought hazily. Despite having dined on almost nothing but the succulent rolls for several days now, and having eaten quite a bit of the war reparations that were constantly being delivered, she oddly felt as if she could go for a few more. The thought of actually standing up and getting some for herself briefly crossed her mind, but it was quickly buried as her body decided it would be far preferable to just remain in her seat. <i>...I'm sure my sister will bring more shortly. I've never known her to let anyone go hungry for long...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if fate was reading her mind, the double doors of the master bedroom opened to reveal quite a display. The daily delivery of cinnamon buns had been expertly arranged so that Junko could recline in the center of them all. Completely buck naked save for her trademark boots, the mastermind casually scarfed away at the nearest confections as Tsumiki, who thankfully had been wrapped up in enough bandages to cover her privates, wheeled her whale of a lover and the mountain of goods over to where she was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, sis!\" Junko declared gleefully as her corpulent form was placed directly in front of the soldier so that all of her nude enormity could be taken in at once. Had her belly not overtaken her lap awhile ago, then the mastermind's cooch would have been directly at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You're naked.\" Mukuro summed up the scene before her as flatly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh! Sometimes it just feels good to let it all hang out!\" Junko raised a flabby arm and let Tsumiki haul her to a seating poisiton. Upon getting a better view of her sister, her eyes lit up in excitement. With her intimate knowledge of how fat collected itself on the female form, she instantly recognized that The Ultimate Soldier must have put on about thirty pounds since caving in to her desires. Mukuro's midsection, which had once been an icky washboard of muscle, was now deliciously graced with a fair sized potbelly that rested ever so slightly onto part of her underwear; which was slowly tearing and disappearing as her butt became more padded, her hips widened, and her thighs came closer and closer to their destiny of constantly rubbing together. Her breasts, while looking somewhat tightly contained within her bra, seemed to have grown the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mastermind's grin became positively wild as this new information was processed in her brain. \"Aw, looky here! My 'big' sister's finally filling out into a big beautiful pear! I'm so proud of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly forced herself off of the delivery cart and leaned over her sister to get a better look. She took her index finger and gently inserted it into Mukro's belly button, pleased to see that it had deepened some amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! I'm so glad you took my advice and realized that innies are way sexier than outies!\" She quickly pulled her finger out of her sister's navel and began prodding   the rest of her belly, taking great joy in watching the ripples dance across her skin. She then took both hands and ran them down the outline of her body, savoring how soft the soldier's sides, hips, and thighs were becoming. Throughout all of this Mukuro simply sat limp in the chair, allowing Junko to have her fun as her face flushed in embarrassment under a deluge of teasing remarks such as: \"Muko's hips don't lie!\", \"Caller of the thunder(thighs).\", and \"Ass cheeks of mass destruction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Are you done yet?\" The bemused soldier muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crown suddenly sat affixed on Junko's head. \"Hmm, I suppose this will do for now! I am proud of you, my sizeable sister! You have finally realized that the euphoria of the feast is irresistible! Ah, but you still have so far to go! And as a true master in this matter, I feel as though it is my duty to help you along in your training!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly pulled Tsumiki in for a kiss; one that lasted long enough for the mastermind to grab a few handfuls of the nurse's ample lovehandles and bandage bound inner thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too, my dear, have truly blossomed under my influence. The ever swelling curve of your belly is alluring beyond measure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehehe!\" Tsumiki giggled and gave it a slap, generating far more ripples than Mukuro's far smaller stomach. \"I-I love it too!\" She then began cupping her ample breasts. \"All of it! Every pound is a monument to the time we've spent together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse's smile widened as she continued feeling herself up. Every word she spoke a clear indication of her absolute devotion to the currently nude mastermind. Junko in turn returned her wide smile, pleased to see her consort enjoying her own corpulent form. With a gentle push, she sat Tsumiki down onto the couch as close to Mukuro as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your loyalty to me and my cause is clear, my consort; and what sort of ruler would I be if I did not greatly reward those closest to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the cart of rolls right up to the side of the sofa and then in a single motion forced her weight on top of both of them, causing the couch to groan under the sudden impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof...\" Mukuro groaned. She had grown used to Junko throwing her weight around when they were growing up, but somehow the mammoth mastermind would always manage to grow larger between each tackle. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence, dear sister! It is time to begin your training!\" Junko grabbed a hold of the nearest cinnamon bun with a her pudgy hand and shoved it directly into Mukuro's mouth. \"If you have time to talk, you have time to chew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grasped another roll and held it up gently to Tsumiki's face. \"Now my dear, tell me that you're getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting fat!\" The nurse quickly parroted as the roll was lovingly slid into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good!\" Junko began to drool slightly. She deftly shoved another roll into Mukuro's mouth, deciding to focus more of her attention on her plump little lovetoy. \"You have gotten quite fat, haven't you dear? Tell me how fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"V-very, very fat!\" A manic rush could be sensed in Tsumiki's voice.\"I was 268 pounds the last time I weighed myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...\" Junko cooed as she rewarded the nurse once more. \"That's quite a... round number, wouldn't you say? But I believe that you have yet to reach your full potential! Tell me that you want to weigh 300 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to weigh 300 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunko's face reddened with arousal. \"You <i>will</i> weigh 300 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>will</i> weigh 300 pounds!\" Junko's satisfaction with her performance was clear to Tsumiki, who threw herself more and more into her lover's game. It was obvious that the two of them would begin having sex any moment, but thankfully for Mukuro the sheer mass of sugary fried dough that had been mechanically shoved into her mouth had been enough to lure her into a calm food coma; causing her to drift off to sleep just as Junko pressed the rest of her weight down on the now quite bloated nurse. Her bandages having began to tear around her midsection from needing to stretch to house all of the food and outright began to shred now that Junko was rubbing her own even larger stomach all over it. The two large ladies were quickly consumed in lust, losing track of everything else in the world as they thought to maximize the euphoric sensations coursing through their body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the culmination of their desires came to fruition, Junko sprawled herself out on top of Tsumiki, enjoying the sounds of the shortened breaths the nurse was forced to make while under her great weight. Things were truly perfect. With Kirigiri defeated, it wouldn't be long now till the whole world would be able to feel what she was feeling right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ahahaha! It feels so good to be Queen!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was close to an hour later that the sound of several knocks came from the door of Junko's hideout. Having been seated down onto a large chair at her feasting table, Tsumiki had been casually feeding her lover all the while, stroking her under the table all the while, every now and then sharing a deep lust filled kiss; all the while Mukuro continued to lay in her own food coma, her hands subconsciously rubbing her stomach as she drifted in and out of dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of her lust, Junko turned her head to Mukuro and let out a small cough to bring the girl back to her senses, however the mercenary girl seemed to content to even be bothered as she continued to laze about; unaware of the world around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Tsumiki was able to make it over to the door, abet every step caused more and more of her already straining bandages to tear as her fat rippled with each step. slightly out of breath as she reached the door, she opened it up to find herself facing a familiar tanned body that had become commonplace these past few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahina had certainly bloomed these past few weeks had grown just like all the other girls; her standard clothes looked incredibly tight as well as seemed to be absorbed into her plush body. Her red jacket had ripped itself apart about a week into the binge eating, her fat arms having been too much for the material, while her shirt had continued it's journey up her ever growing stomach. As for right now it served more as a bra for the girl as her usual bra's had broken long ago. Her lower body was in a similar state of dress as her socks looked to be straining and her shoes having burst at the seams a couple of days ago. Her shorts had been steadily absorbed into her large rear while her panties had either been ripped or were hidden behind the shorts; all and all the former swimmer looked almost nude to Tsumiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... *Pant*... Tsumiki...\" The large girl looked out of breath as she waddled into the base, her labored breaths being the only sound available outside of the munching coming from Junko. Aoi's presence had become commonplace these past couple of weeks, the once star swimmer falling to the cinnamon bun's trick as well. Now days she could be found at the base whenever she had free time, engorging on food and growing ever larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the star athlete approached the table, she paid no mind to the various states of undress surrounding her, having gotten used to it, and proceeded to try and strip herself of her own clothes. To Asahina, they were all girls, and it didn't matter what state of dress you were in so long as you were comfy. Of course the first time she' seen Junko naked she'd freaked out a bit, but as time went on she'd learned to ignore it. Moving her thick arms to her shirt, she struggled to pull the tight clothing off as Tsumiki, having gotten used to helping her friend, helped. As the shirt got past her thick chins and off her head with a resounding 'oof' from Asahina, Tsumiki helped wrap a few bandages around Asahina's nude breasts, covering the girl's modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank's Tsumiki, I swear the shirt's getting shrunk in the wash, I can barely breath in it now days.\" Asahina's rather innocent remark resounding through the room as Tsumiki returned to her lover, now feeding her while every now and again taking several pieces of food for herself. \"Don't mention it Asahina, what are freinds for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMukuro was beginning to come out of her food coma as Asahina had entered the base, her stomach awakening her in the knowledge that another feast was about to take place. While initially having been reserved about participating in such a thing, she'd grown to become a part of every feast; and while a month ago she would say she'd never thought of being a part of her sick twisted sister's fantasy, she now found herself intertwined with her sister's perverse games, whether she knew it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up with a bit of a struggle, the growing mercenary moved to bring out the dishes for the next feast while everyone moved to get comfortable at the table; nobody knowing that they were playing into Kirigiri's hands.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since the two weeks has passed, Tsumiki had started to see changes in the other girls behavior. As Mukuro had just continued lace around in front of the TV for the past weeks, and had developed a proper pot belly which was still the smallest part of her. Mukuro's bottom had started to become rather plump, when she would sit down her hips would spread out on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than the occasional chocolate stain, she was only wearing her underwear which only was a few pounds away from being just threads of cloth. And as the black haired girl started to bite into another cinnamon bun,Tsumiki could see the start of a second chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki had noticed that most of the girls, as of late had their physical activities almost reduced to none. In Mukuro's case she almost never left the couch, only going to the bathroom or bed when necessary. She lived almost a circle of eating sleeping and watching tv, which caused Mukoro to practically inflate like a blimp.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMukoro wasn't of course not the only girl who had started to pack on more pounds, than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Junko, she had started to be way more inactive when it came to their private sections. Now that Junko preferred to be the one who was feed the most, rather than stuffing Tsumiki to the brim. Witch she still did, but not as intensely as before. She was still the dominant in the relationship they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as Tsumiki walked toward with the cart of cake and cinnamon buns, to one of the one of the big tables in the base. Where junko had positioned, herself in a one of the other sofas. She was still practically nude most of the time, just eating everything Tsumiki came with as Junkos growth was the most notorious of all of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Junko kept having one massive feast after another. With each bite Junko took, could her plump lover see her second chain jiggle slightly as she chewed on her food. A lot of Tsumiki's massive lover\u2019s features had grown like her bottom and her hips and even arms. But the two features that had grown the most was her bust and belly. As her belly managed reach a little past her knees when she sat down. Junko was definitely in the 400 pound category by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs junko spotted Tsumiki after she finished one of her many meals, she made one of her posses almost immediately. Junko crossed her hands in stuck out her tongue and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the fuck had you been Tsumiki, you better get the fuck over here this instant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki of course obeyed her massive lover\u2019s order, and goes over to her immediately. <br>\r\nAs she approaches her she is grabbed by her plump hand and pulled even closer to her and  lands right next to junko. Tsumiki then laid on the couch so her head laid on top of her lover\u2019s belly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThan Junko proceeded to feel Tsumiki\u2019s body, and slides her fingers between one of her love handles. As Junko could feel Tsumiki\u2019s body, she could feel she had grown. As junko feels through her body she starts talking a lot mere seductive to the smaller lover and ask her a few questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you been eating properly\u201d said Junko while moving her hand down Tsumiki's waist and past her bandages, that she uses for most of her clothing when she\u2019s not outside.<br>\r\nTsumiki\u2019s answers with a \u201cof course i have\u201d. Than junko finds one of the cinnamon buns and proceeds to feed Tsumiki. This went on for a while until they were interrupted, by a growl coming from Junko\u2019s enormous stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThats strange, i usually can go on longer without getting so hungry\u201d. <br>\r\nAs Junko said that, she remembered that it all started a few weeks ago. And that she has been unusually hungry, for the past few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you wanna switch\u201d, Tsumiki asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying that Junko snapped out of her inner thoughts, and felt like getting a good amount of food before getting up and go to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d Junko replied, as they switched positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith now junko laying on tsumiki\u2019s lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Junko has found a comfortable position Tsumiki started cramming all sort of pastries down Junko\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\nTsumiki started by grabbing a huge slice of cake and showed it into Junko\u2019s greedy maw, and watched it disappear almost as soon as she had grabbed it. The two lovers started both to feel a fire igniting between their legs, after junko had eaten a whole layered chocolate cake with whipped cream. Which only caused the feeding to get more intense, as tsumiki grabbed a jug of chocolate milk and placed it on Junko plump lips. She then began to chug the suppetence, a small drop of the chocolate milk escaped her mouth and continued down her chins and onto her vast naked cleavage.Junko then made of few moans, while chugging the the rest down. Which only made both of them even more aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Junko was done, tsumiki removed the jug from her lips. So Junko could lift her cellulite covered rear up from the couch and waddled to the bedroom with Tsumiki right beside her. Each step Junko took caused her naked body to jiggle, Which her lover enjoyed the site of and the sound her legs rubbing together. But now Tsumiki could also hear a low huffing coming from Junko, which made Tsumiki on the brink of losing her mind out of excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as they closed the doors, mukoro woke up from another food coma. Thinking that it was about now, that asahina should be arriving. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kirigiri sat at one of the newly remodeled desks that the academy had been forced to purchase after the recent... \"trend\" that had been started. Class had ended a few minutes ago, and she had stayed behind to review the progress report of her and Komaeda's current plan. She opened up the manila folder with less than perfect efficiency do to how pudgy her digits had become, though she paid it no mind as her eyes began decoding the wild handwriting of her albino accomplice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- 100 \"Cinnamon Buns\" delivered every day for the past 41 days. All eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Production continues unimpeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Situation <u>HOPEFUL</u>. All perpetrators likely to be incapacitated by the end of the year! Maybe in time for Christmas? It'll be the perfect thing to go with your fried chicken!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri frowned slightly at the oddity in the last sentence. <i>Why is \"hopeful\" entirely capitalized and underlined? Either one or the other would have been sufficient to draw my attention.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden tap on her back startled the detective, causing her to quickly slap the file shut before turning around to see that the instigator was none other than the author of the document currently grasped in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKomaeda grinned. \"Hey there, old buddy, old pal! How're things going on your end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" The detective's face returned to its normal stoic expression. \"Though I had thought that this plan would take a few months at most. The end of the year is still a ways away, which gives our mutual adversary a lot of time to realize she's being duped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked out through a nearby window. \"Well, it's like I said. The chemicals that we're using are very much a trial run here. None of it has been properly tested so we can't know the exact date when everything will run its course, so I thought maybe it would be better to speculate a bit longer term than I had originally planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around to face her again, shrugging with a delighted grin on his face. \"I can tell you this, though! Once those drugs are in your system, you won't feel like doing anything at all! I should know, I missed a whole week of classes to make sure that that stuff works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri nodded. \"At least they won't be causing anymore trouble in the meantime. If the effectiveness of the drugs can be assured, then waiting it out shouldn't be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My thoughts exactly. Glad we could be on the same page, partner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached into his unzipped hoodie and pulled out an envelope that had it's flap hanging open slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, this letter was meant for you, but I thought it would be best if I checked it for poison first. I mean, what kind of accomplice would I be if I let my associates get taken out by the enemy on my watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the strange boys words, she took the envelope and immediately her pupils dilated in surprise as she realized that it had been sent from Naegi. She hastily tore it open and began reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Naegi wants to meet with me! He says its rather urgent.</i> She couldn't help but blush slightly at the request, skimming through the rest of the document to quickly decipher the time and place they were to meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alright. His room at 3:45 today. That's...</i> She glanced over at the clock. <i>In ten minutes!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly shoved the letter into her large jacket. \"Komaeda, why couldn't you have delivered this letter to me sooner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I had just finished analyzing it. Don't worry though, I'm sure you can make it on time if you hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly let out of breath of exasperation, before taking off in a dead sprint out of the classroom. Moving as quickly through hallways and up staircases as her rounded body would allow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi sat on the lower corner of his bed, a complex look of worry and guilt hanging about him. He glanced over at the round clock placed on his wall for the tenth time in three minutes, worrying if the friend he had neglected would care to respond to his request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...She won't show.</i> He sighed dejectedly. <i>Not that I blame her. Things really seem to be getting more and more hectic recently.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo try and calm himself, he pulled out his cell phone and thumbed open the pictures file. Within were quite a few pictures of he and Asahina enjoying themselves around the city. There was one of them getting hot dogs together in Dogenzaka, a set of them taken with them in funny poses as if from a photo booth, and... one he'd rather not let anyone else see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis door was suddenly thrown open, causing him to jump slightly as a heavily breathing Kirigiri forced herself into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm here!\" She gasped. Naegi helped her over to his bed while he took a seat at the desk he used to do homework. After taking a minute to collect herself, the detective was ready to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why have you called me here today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lucky student was unable to make eye contact with her. \"I... I wanted to apologize first. We didn't exactly part on good terms last time, and I know I could have found time to drop by sooner, but I didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri's heart missed a beat. It was so good to hear that Naegi still wished to be close to her. \"It's no trouble, really. You've been busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \"I guess... Look, the reason I asked for you was to talk to you about Aoi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? Having relationship problems?\" She realized a bit too late that she may have been insinuating something there and hoped she hadn't come across as rude, but thankfully Naegi didn't seem offended by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe. Things were going great, then all of a sudden she just... disappears. She hasn't gone to class in two weeks, I've called and checked her room, there's no answer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tensed up. \"This sounds very serious...\" Despite how much Aoi had been turned against her, she still didn't want her to come to harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I know... I've talked to nearly everyone and no one's seen her either.\" He balled his fists and started shaking slightly. \"I just- I'm worried sick about her. I know you two aren't friends anymore, but I'm begging you to please help me! She could be in a lot of trouble, or-\" He gulped hard. \"Worse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose from her seat. \"Say no more. I'll get started immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaegi brightened. \"Thank you, Kirigiri. This means a lot to me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" She smiled back. \"What are friends for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled over to him and offered her hand. \"Come on, let's go find her and bring her back.\"</span></div></div>",

While Kirigiri wouldn't mind if Asahina and Naegi's relationship came to an end, she still likes Asahina as a friend, and the thought of her becoming immobile was a rather shocking thought for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two arrived back on the bottom floor, after spending close to 3 hours searching the school; most of the time set to Kirigiri taking a break to rest and maybe get something to eat; she was thinking of a way to separate from Naegi, to pop into Junko's lair and look for Asahina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... on't understand, we've looked everywhere and yet there's no trace of her.

The only one we haven't seen is Tsumiki and she's been with her girlfriend for a few weeks now, so she's off the list.\" Naegi gave an almost depressive sigh as hesat down next to Kiigiri on one of the school benches and seemed to zone out a bit; his mind most likely going through any sinarios he might have missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past Kirigiri would have remarked on how the two of them had switched situations almost, however the current state of Asahina was something she had to check; so, drawing Naegi's attention back by placing one of her meaty hands on his shoulder, the young luckster snapped back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naegi, while she might not be at school, she may have gone into town where something happened to her.\" A bit of light entered her crushes eyes as he seemed to nibble at the bait she was setting. \"How about you go to her usual binge spots and see if anyone's seen her; that should help re-ignite the trail once more.\" Accepting the trail Kirigiri'd set, the brown haired teen turned and wrapped his arms around her as best he could, giving her a tight squeeze as he thanked her for her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSavoring the moment as best she could, when his presence left her as the boy began to make his way out of the school and towards the town, Kirigiri stood up and readjusted her outfit as best she could before beginning to make her way towards the entrance of Junko's hideout, hoping that Asahina hadn't fallen into her trap.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kirigiri banged the bottom of her chubby fist against the large double doors, hoping that someone within was still coherent and light enough to get up and open the door for her. During the ride down the elevator she had contemplated playing the part of the crushed adversary that had gotten her in last time, though if what Komaeda said was true, then Junko shouldn't be in a position to catch on to the reason for her visit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes passed with no response from within. Kirigiri's heart rate rose at the thought that the buns might have already immobilized everyone within Junko and Tsumiki's inner circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, there has to be another reason!</i> She rapped her fist against the door once more. How could she tell Naegi that she had accidently fattened and drugged his girlfriend to the point that she was no longer able to function in the pursuit of her vengance? He would think her a monster! No better than the mad mastermind herself! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust imagining the damage she could have caused between her and Naegi as well as the physical cost inflicted on the already corpulent Asahina forced the detective to shudder and to take a knee on the ground below. <i>Please... Please let her be okay.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective wasn't trapped by speculation for much longer however, as just as her despair was beginning to set in, the door slowly pulled open, revealing a sight that was arguably just as bad. Sections of the once opulent headquarters had been coated in a rather thick layer of dust, the big brother feel the monitors gave off now coming across as just as dated as the novel they spawned from. The room was also plagued by piles of cans, wrappers, tins, and every other food container imaginable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's like an abandoned Fraternity house...</i> She mused uncomfortably as she continued to take in her surroundings. That's when she saw it. The only maintained section of the elaborate underground base was in the far right corner of the room where three couches had been formed into a square with the open side facing her, allowing her to see the full havoc the buns could wreak on a waistline. The Eastern couch was filled with a dark haired girl that Kirigiri didn't recognize who looked to be barely above a comatose state. She looked to be the lightest of the bunch, though that wasn't very encouraging when she was currently laying in the torn remains of what must have been the last set of clothing she was able to dress herself in before the drugs rendered her unable to motivate herself to put something new on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the North was none other than the obese mastermind herself, whom the detective had the misfortune of viewing in all of her nude glory as a droplet of drool made its way down her cheeks. While she had always been easily one of the fattest girls that she had ever known, now she was absolutely gigantic by anyone's standards. Kept somewhat decent by her billowing apron of a belly, the Ultimate \"Fashionista\" had to be nearing the 400 pound mark. Fat was storing itself everywhere it could fit, making it look like her whole body was working to become as round as possible. She almost felt some proud vindiction at how the mammoth mastermind's insane drive had consumed her so; but any thought of that quickly died as her eyes fell upon the third couch occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aoi!\" She involuntarily shouted as she ran over to her. She looked to be in between the two other girls in terms of size, likely somewhere in the high 200's low 300's Kirigiri reasoned, though it was hard to be exact given that her entire body had been wrapped up in bandages like a mummy to preserve some sense of decency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe detective grabbed ahold of both of her estranged friend's meaty shoulders and gave her a strong shake. \"Aoi, it's me, Kirigiri! Please wake up, I'm here to get you out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most the former athlete could give in response was a weak burp from being jostled so much. She briefly considered dragging her friend out of here, but soon realized that given her current weight and the detective's own lifting strength, she probably couldn't get her off the couch, let alone get her out of the decaying room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden cheerful humming noise directed her attention to one of the doors leading further into the base. From behind it emerged Tsumiki, as plump and wrapped from head to toe as Asahina, pushing a small cart full of various soups and nursing supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for checkups everyone!\" She cheered as she pushed her cart into the foyer. Suddenly halting as her eyes spotted Kirigiri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello there!\" Out of everything she had experienced since coming here today, the disturbingly chipper way the fat nurse was handling the situation was the most off putting of all. \"Will you be joining us for lunch today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsumiki!\" The detective shouted. <i>She's definitely put on a few, but isn't comatose like the others. Did she not have any of the cinnamon buns?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith wimsical abandon, the nurse shoved the cart directly at her and began sprinting after it, unable to dodge, the detective was knocked right on her ass into what little seat was left next to Asahina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very glad you could stop by!\" Tsumiki beamed as she took her place next to the cart, taking a moment to re-arrange everything hat had jostled loose from the cart before she began pouring bowls of a strange murky liquid. \"Guests first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offered the bowl to Kirigiri, who merely swatted it away as she tried to escape from the double pin of the cart and Aoi's growing gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Silly me!\" The nurse quickly refilled what was spilled, as well as enough to barely prevent it from spilling over. She noticed the detective trying to leave her seat. \"Oh no, please! Allow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bumped the cart with her own chubby tummy before pinning the detective underneath her superior weight and pouring the entire contents of the bowl at once. Kirigiri had no choice but to drink it all or gag, feeling a mixture of disgust and twisted satisfaction as she felt the strongly sweet tasting liquid rush over her tongue and down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what'd you think?\" The nurse asked innocently, seemingly completely oblivious that she had just force fed her \"guest\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off of me!\" The detective struggled, but was unable to escape from Tsumiki's girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Someone seems excited for seconds!\" With one free hand, Tsumiki refilled a bowl and transported its thick contents down Kirigiri's mouth once more. This bowl was followed by a third, then a fourth and fifth, until finally Tsumiki was satisfied by how bloated the thick liquid had caused the detective to become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled herself off of the detective and bowed like a master chef. \"I'm so glad you enjoyed it, it's my own secret recipe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki moved on to Aoi and the others, holding their heads upright so that even while barely awake they too could be filled to the brim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I *urp* I need to get out of here!</i> Kirigiri forced herself to her feet and sprinted out of the room, forcing herself to get through the pain inside her overextended midsection. Thankfully, Tsumiki seemed too absorbed in feeding the others to notice her departure, and the detective was soon safe aboard the elevator and on her way back up to the school proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She- she's gone completely mad!</i> The detective sat down against the wall and began rubbing her bloated belly. <i>Those drugs... they must have had some sort of reverse effect on her that has her locked in a manic state.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe weakly pounded her fist against the wall behind her, her whole form shaking with shock and exasperation. <i>This has to end... no one deserves to be like that...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small stream of tears began to roll down her face. <i>Least of all, Aoi.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Within the mystery student's room, Komaeda sat at his chair going over the events of the past few weeks. Thus far the operation seemed to be going smoothly; the girls hadn't really been seen lately and the trays the buns were being delivered on were always returned, licked clean and not a trace of the buns left. According to Hanamura, when he'd been tasked with delivering the sweets, he apparently saw one of Junko's accomplices already showing her gain. Mukuro, if what Kirigiri's report said, had already looked to have put on 40 or so pounds when she'd last been seen, and if that was someone just starting to gain, the damage done to Junko and Tsumiki would be that much greater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Soon Tsumiki, Junko will be finished...'</i> Moving out of his chair, he figured he would hit the gym and check in on Hanamura to see about perhaps upping the chemical intake, when Kirigiri's heavy frame burst through his door. Admittedly startled, the stare the poor girl was in looked even worse as she was breathing heavily, her already tight extra large uniform looking to be bursting once more from the stuffed state of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly sweating hard from the run to his room, he motioned for the girl to take a seat on his bed as she began to tell him his tale. Asahina, Mukuro, and even Junko, now all held captive by the maddening of his Tsumiki. If it wasn't for Kirigiri's sorry state, he'd think this was just a tall tale, but her clear shock over seeing the event had clearly left her a bit dazed, and that wasn't even counting the state she was in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kirigiri finished her tale, Komaeda tried to focus not on the fact that Tsumiki had taken all three girls hostage, but the fact that the three had gained so much. Even with his buns, the girls shouldn't have been able to gain so much unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes wide with realization, he quickly schooled his features while Kirigiri had fallen onto her back, her stuffed state and exhaustion too much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My formula; could she have gotten her hands on it?' It wasn't outside the realms of possibilities, someone goes to him, gets the formula, and decided to give it pure to Tsumiki who takes her fantasies way too far. But for that to happen-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not alone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was quiet and could barely be heard above the panting of Kirigiri was still cradled her stuffed belly with her eyes closed, her hands almost sensually caressing the tautness of it while awaiting Komaeda's decision. Komaeda was meanwhile almost beating himself to death in his head for forgetting one critical thing about Junko; that she was a manipulator. She had plenty of allies, lots of ties, and clearly was unafraid to put on some persona to get new 'friends' whenever she wanted to. As it stands, anyone who was with her this school year could be an accomplice, and could have gotten Tsumiki the formula. Calming down slightly, he addressed Kirigiri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Kirigiri, you go rest up and tell Naegi that you couldn't find her. I'll get in touch with some people and we'll meet soon, I promise that we'll deal with Tsumiki soon.\" Receiving a nod from the bloated girl, she heaved herself up and off of his bed and waddled out the door, the sound of threads straining and snapping with every step accompanying her out. Closing the door on her and wating a few minutes for her to leave, he gathered a few of his things before exiting the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Hanamura, you'd better <u><b>HOPE </b></u>that you have answers...'</i> Storming towards the chef's territory, he was intent on finding out what had happened to his plan.</span></div></div>",

Ever since the girls at the school has started packing on the pounds, his services as a cook had gone up drastically in demand. From supplying the student store with all manner of pastries and ramen, to providing personal banquets featuring cuisine from all over the world, the Ultimate Cook, or as he preferred, the Ultimate Chef, had really made it big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hah, mom was right all along! The quickest way to a woman's heart is most definitely through her stomach!</i> He picked up his prized stack of 1000 marked bills and fanned himself with it like a cartoon caricature of a rich person. <i>This whole fat fad is the best thing that's happened since sliced bread! All the ladies dig a man who knows his way around a stove now. The real question I should be asking myself is which one of the most eligible singles I should make a move on?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed his stack down and begun to stroke his chin as he poured himself a glass of the finest chardonnay his new money could buy. <i>Sonia's definitely quite the looker, and royalty to boot! To think, someone like me could have the chance to become royalty!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark thought crossed his mind and he suddenly froze up. <i>On second thought, Gundam's been barking up that tree for awhile- even if he won't outright say it everyone know's it, and he'd probably find away to sell my soul to the devil if I snatched her from him... maybe being royalty is beyond my humble origins after all...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis further ruminations on potential future girlfriends was interrupted by his door suddenly being shoved open, causing him to duck behind his unbreakable wall of dosh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh! I already said I was sorry! I swear I had no idea that you were already taken Owa-\" He paused in his apology as he saw the trademark white tufts of hair jutting out from the top of Komaeda's head. \"...Oh. Hey, Komadea. How's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know,\" He opened with a happy smile. \"I burned myself while cooking breakfast this morning, I did my laundry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, he sprinted up to the cook and grabbed him by the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, and my master plan to <b>HOPEFULLY</b> bring down biggest threat to <b><u>HOPE</u></b> the world has ever known has been badly derailed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what the fuck?!\" Hanamura shouted as he was yanked out of his seat by the albino student. \"Let go of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, I will, maybe I won't. It depends a lot on what the next words out of your mouth are. Pretending that you don't know- though given that you've been the one making the deliveries each day this would be impossible- I'll go ahead and give you a quick run down. The cinnamon buns that you've been making and spiking each day for me? Apparently in addition to making the consumer an indolent addict, they can also give someone boundless energy; as I learned earlier today when my associate paid a visit to the enemy base. Not only that, but I also heard that she's gotten a hold of a liquid substance that keeps the other girls under the same effects- meaning that it could have only been made with my recipe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe click of a switchblade being extended could be heard. Hanamura's eyes darted down to see the thin blade being brought towards his neck. \"So, in light of this, I have come to you seeking answers. What. Happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay! Look, I know I should have told you, but you've got it all wrong! I've been doing everything you said, giving them the buns without a word about what's in 'em! But one day, the nurse answers the door all super-cheery. It was really weird. She told me that her friends weren't feeling too well, and that I melt the goods down into soup so they can still enjoy them. At first I said no, but then she gets super cute and flirty with me and- shit, I couldn't say no! So for the last few days those girls have been on a liquid diet, but so what? They're practically comatose now! You still get to win no matter which way they eat that stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKomaeda pondered on his answer momentarily, then, apparently believing his answer and the motivation for his actions, he released his grip on the cook and retracted his knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well why didn't you just say so?\" His happy attitude from earlier returned. \"If that's all there is to it, then things should still be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanamura sighed, relieved. \"Yeah, that's everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Then just keep up the good work and I'll see you at card game night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a quick wave and let himself out. Hanamura seemed to visibly deflate in his chair as he mulled over how he was just threatened at knife point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit! I knew he was kinda off, but that was just insane!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. <i>I need to find away to get out of this! At first I was just doing it as a favor to him, but now-... Ugh, calm down Hanamura, you're on top of your game, you gotta play it careful or you'll lose everything!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was suddenly put at ease by a sudden realization. He picked up some of his wads of cash and slipped them into his chef's coat. <i>I know what I need: I need some new friends!</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hanamura could only stare at the figure in front of him with an almost blank look on his face as he looked at the figure in front of him once more, as if the pieces in front of him didn't match. Sakura Ogami, 'the ogre', 'the monster, the ultimate martial artist, had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hanamura had known that the girls were changing, it was such a surprise to see that the Ogre looking like... this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer usual attire was still there; her bandaged legs, her white sailor uniform, her blue skirt all were the same, only now the figure inside them had completely changed. Where once there was dark, almost red, skin, now was only a light tan color. His hair, once wild and moving with an almost invisible power, seemed more controlled and level. Her once mannish features and overly powerful body now appeared feminine, and if he had to say so himself, incredibly hot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, the ultimate martial artist had seemingly reverted, back to how she looked some odd 4 years ago before meeting Kenshiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know the girls are getting fat, but could this new fad have actually effected her?' It was hard to believe, but certainly plausible. While other girls had been bulging out and letting their bodies deteriorate with fat, Sakura had lose a lot of her muscle mass, giving her a rather sleek and feminine appearance which, if he had to say so himself, would have nabbed her any guy not currently into the whole 'fat phase' the school seemed attracted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hanamura was pondering what had happened to Sakura, the white haired girl stood silently, a small blush on her cheeks as she hid her embarrassment a bit. Ever since her boyfriend Kenshiro finally got out of the hospital and reclaimed the title of 'worlds strongest', she had allowed herself to 'loosen up' for him, to try and be the girlfriend he wanted. The slacking in training, the slight overeating that had effected every girl in the school, and the fact that Kenshiro appeared to love her no matter her body shape, had her muscle mass diminish and her old appearance come back; something that many around the school had trouble believing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that she was actually being hit on had been something she hadn't been expecting, as a lot of the guys who didn't appreciate the fact that girls body shapes were 'filling out', had sought her out since she was apparently one of the last girls in the school to have, and she's quoting one of her would be suitors on this, 'a rocking body!' Thankfully Kenshiro, who'd since recovered from his numerous illnesses after a remarkable recovery, had been there to chase them off, as she'd been too shocked and embarrassed to respond to their advances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterr a solid five minutes of Hanamura's incredulous staring, Sakura gave a light cough to bring the man out of his daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanamura, if I may, might I ask why you have brought me here?\" Up until yesterday she hadn't paid the chef any thought, meeting him only a few times in passing. Then yesterday she get's a message that he wants to hire her services as a bodyguard, only for him to now look at her as if she wasn't who she said she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling himself together, the rather pudgy chef straightened himself up before addressing his associate. \"Yes, well, recently I've begun to worry about my health. With the current state of things and the numerous girls 'changing' around the school, I've been threatened and am in need of someone to watch my back.\" A bit of a white lie, along with a few things kept out, it wasn't that hard to believe that he would be in danger, especially since his services have become increasingly prominent as of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already had my life threatened and seeing as you're one of the strongest on campus, I was hoping you'd be able to guard me when I'm on campus. Through my time here, I've gotten a good amount of money and I'll be willingly to pay you a large amount and even make your meals for you, so long as you stand guard over me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Sakura, this seemed like a rather straight forward job. Like a samurai standing guard over his lord, she would guard him from foreign threats. Plus the fact he was paying her would make things better overall as she was hoping to spend time with Kenshiro, perhaps take a vacation together. A steady paying job would do wonders for that goal, and the fact that she would even get to taste the ultimate cook's food, which had become a high commodity now days, would only sweeten the deal in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll do it,\" spoke the white haired warrior, not knowing just what she had involved herself in. Meanwhile Hanamura had several thoughts going through his head. 'Let's see you try to bully me now, Komaeda!' being the most prominent.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Komaeda took his seat at the head of a long table that had been moved into the rec room on the third floor of the school. Normally, the room would be locked by this hour, but he just \"happened\" upon the janitor's key lying on the floor and had ever intention to return it.... eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poured himself a mug of coffee before looking up to his co-conspirators. Sitting nearest to him on the right side of the table was Kirigiri, having returned to her usual stoic self once she had recovered from having to exert herself so much while completely bloated earlier. To his left sat Kuzuryu, one of the co-creators of their culinary weapon and the supplier of the very much untested and unregulated chemicals that made the cinnamon buns so debilitating. Next to the Yakuza heir sat the other vital piece of their modus operandai, Hanamura. Truth be told Komaeda was somewhat relieved to see that he had agreed to come to their meeting, knowing full well that some of the students at the school didn't truly yet understand their role in bringing <i>HOPE</i> to the world and were occasionally prone to mis-interpreting his noble aims as \"creepy\", \"stalker-ish\" or, in one instance \"Exactly what a serial killer would do\". It was okay though, these words never bothered him. The students here had the right to say whatever they wanted. After all, they were bringing <i>HOPE</i> to the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did bother him a little bit was the fact that the person sitting beyond the stout chef was none other than Sakura Ogami; but not the Sakura he had venerated as the Ultimate Martial Artist. Gone was her sun worn skin and a good majority of the muscle mass that made her stand out as a pillar of strength worthy of the name of Hope's Peak Academy. Now she looked like any regular old girl who hit the gym every other weekend, her height the only trait that was remotely eye catching to the average onlooker now. He would certainly have to give her a stern talking to once the business of tonight was concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from where Hanamura and Sakura sat were the largely unexpected attendees Saionji and Koizumi. These two normally had nothing to do with Komaeda's operation, but the fact that neither of them had gained a noticeable amount of weight since the start of this incident suggested to him that they were completely free of Junko's influence, and could be trusted to at least not betray his plan to the enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"how long are we just going to sit around like losers in the dark for?\" Saionji barked as she crossed her arms and pouted like the grade schooler she was often mistaken for. \"I was told that we were going to put a stop to all of the fatasses who've taken over the school and made it impossible for a real girl like me to get the  gummi bears I deserve for being so great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanamura made an silent gagging motion to Kuzuryu at her mention of being a \"real girl\". It was commonly joked by many of the boys at the school that her appearance and attitude were so bratty that anyone who even considered asking her out would immediately get traced by the cops and arrested for paedophillia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw that, tubs!\" She barked. \"Do it again and I'll kick you so hard you'll have to get a career as a soprano singer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKomaeda rapped the table to get everyone's attention.\"Now now everyone, settle down. We're all friends here, right? United in a common goal to preserve the dignity and purpose of our wonderful academy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should start, then? To avoid any further tangents.\" Kirigiri recommended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"An excellent idea, Kirigiri!\" He spun a blackboard behind his seat over to reveal a set of photographs connected by a series of red yarn. It was like a scene straight out of a murder mystery show, with all of Hope's Peak Academy's most prominent ladies tacked on with tape with a little post-it note below their picture that gave their former weight and current weight, causing the detective to blush in embarrassment as the fact that she was getting dangerously close to being nearer to 300 pounds than 200 pounds was now on display for everyone to see. Nearly every girl that had put on weight had a red string that connected to Tsumiki's picture, which in turn was connected by a black thread to a picture of Junko that Komaeda had to dredge up from last year's yearbook that had been cartoonishly defaced with a pair of devil horns, a toothbrush mustache, and a comment that clearly read \"Worse than Hitler!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's eyes widened in shock as she noted just how much weight that Asahina put on; she was now more than twice as heavy as when this incident had started!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could this have happened?\" She murmured in disbelief. \"I know I have been away for quite some time, but this is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the doing of <i>Junko Enoshima</i>.\" Rage could almost be seen beneath the surface of Komaeda's calm exterior as he spat out her name. \"She's a master manipulator who used Tsumiki here,\" He pointed a laser pointer at the nurse's picture, curiously the only one showing her old svelte self before her weight gain began to set in. Like the picture of Junko, it had been doodled on as well, though the halo fixated above her head contrasted with the diabolical portrayal of her lover. The notes written near her were much more considerate, \"Kind at heart\" and \"Corrupted by a bad influence\" being the easiest to read. \"To slowly turn the school in favor of sloth and overindulgence to fulfill her own sick desires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled widely. \"But her time is almost at an end! Thanks to regular ingestion of some drugs that Kuzuryu found off the black market, every member of her organization has been incapacitated- all except for Tsumiki, who's body seems to have had the opposite of the intended reaction that taking the drugs should have had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given the current condition of their forces, I have decided that now would be the perfect time to decapitate their little group completely by breaking into Junko's hideout, extracting Tsumiki and anyone else who was innocently caught in our trap, and take over finishing Enoshima off ourselves now that she's powerless to stop us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a quick breath. \"Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually.\" Koizumi spoke up. \"Why are you dragging Saionji and I into this mess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I know that I can trust you two! The fact that you've managed to keep your girlish figures means that you have to have no association with Junko! Even the lowest ranked person in her inner circle sports a potbelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why do we have to 'storm the fortress' with you? You're a man, can't you take care of it yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but if you don't help me out, then you'll miss out in getting all of the fancy cameras she has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What sort of cameras?\" She asked, her interest peaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm not sure, but boy do they look expensive!\" He glanced around the room. \"Any further quesitons? No? Then let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator doors opened to reveal the most familiar room of Junko's lair, somehow looking in an even worse state than the last time Kirigiri was there. All of the lights were off, and Junko's master computer said was suspiciously missing from the monitor wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is disgusting!\" Saionji spat. \"No wonder all the pigs at this school hang out down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if waiting for someone to speak, one of the remaining monitors on the wall suddenly lit up, revealing the corpulent Tsumiki bouncing up in down in Junko's iconic office chair, the flesh exposed between her loose bandages jiggling violently with each movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe! Try and find me!\" She said cheerily. \"There are some flashlights over there for everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monitor went dark as everyone fumbled over to the indicated spot and grabbed a flashlight. As they got into position, the sound of the elevator departing upwards could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh. Guess she wants to fuck with us a bit.\" Kuzuryu snarled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, she just wants to play! Who doesn't love hide and seek?\" Komaeda responded with another smile. \"Now come on, let's split into teams and track her down. The sooner we find her, the sooner everyone can go home.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I can't believe we got roped into this,\" muttered Saionji and both she and Koizumi trekked down the dark hallways of Junko's secret base, flashlights in hand. When they'd been approached to deal with the rising weight of their fellow students, neither thought that this is what they would be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just deal with it, I'll even buy your some of those treats you like when this is all over. So long as I can have some of the equipment here, It'll be worth it for me.\" Koizumi's muttering from next to her brought a large grin to the traditional dancer, as she pictured some of the snacks her friend would be buying her for this excursion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I can't believe is how Tsumiki was the one responsible for all of this, that ditsy girl was useless up until a short while ago, and now she'd a part of some huge conspiracy.\" Koizumi's words reminded Saionji about how both she and her friend treated her prior to this whole mess. It's a wonder that both she and Koizumi hadn't been dragged into this mess and blimped up like the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, once we find her, I'll show that pig her place. She'll regret daring to cross the line she did.\" A sadistic grin came to the dancer's face as she thought of the torment she'd rain down on Tsumiki once she found her. The best part? Nobody would stop her! She'd be the good guy in everyone's eyes, punishing the bitch that dared to try and play everyone like chess pieces!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of the rather cruel thoughts going through her friends head, Koizumi just nodded and continued to search through the hideout, her eyes noting digital camera's lining the hallway. Making note to 'appropriate' them when the job was done, the ultimate photographer soon spotted a small light at the end of the hallway, hidden behind a door. Motioning to Saionji, the girl nodded to her friend as both made their way to the door, pressing their ears to the door, they listened in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound that greeted them was one of slight moaning as well as the sound of food behind stuffed into someones mouth. Now knowing that someone was behind the door, the two carefully opened the door and slipped inside, the sight that greeted them being not the one they were expecting<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in her girlfriends chair, the large Tsumiki had one hand shoveling pastries of all kinds into her mouth, a pleased look on her face, while her eyes stayed closed and a blush on her cheeks. The other hand however was inside the bandages on the front of her body, specifically between her legs. A moan and pant escaping the fat girls mouth every few seconds as the motion of her hand was sending ripples throughout her fat body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught both embarrassed at walking in on the girl masturbating, but also shocked at the sight of just how fat Tsumiki had gotten, both stood unaware of what to do; embarrassed blushes on their faces as Tsumiki seemed to finish herself as with a large groan, a wet spot appeared on the front of her bandaged and the new mastermind opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saionji... Koizumi... You found me~!\" Panting as she leaned back, the girl pulled a towel out from behind her as she wiped off her hand. \"You caught me with my pants down, as you can see, but it looks like you won this round! Hehehehehe!\" Giggling to herself, this gave the two girls the room to pull themselves together as Saionji moved towards the obese girl, her usual cocky smile on her face as she figured she could once more put the girl in her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on lard-o, it's over. Give up now and I promise I'll make things easier on you!' The petite girl cracked her knuckles in a threatening manner as the bandaged nurse put a sausage like finger to her chins and seemed to ponder this; Koizumi meanwhile had moved back behind her friend, letting the girl do her usual actions and preparing to offer backup if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsumiki meanwhile had dropped her rather cheerful persona momentarily as a look of utter outrage came to her face, memories of her tormentor coming to mind as she remembered Saionji's bullying. However a blank look came to her face next before a wide grin sprouted on it. Despite the action, the look in her eyes showed that clearly she wasn't all there and that Saionji and her friend were in for some trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna~! Besides, I don't have to listen to a child like you anymore.\" Came the rather childish reply from the girl as she stuck out her tongue, her insult hitting the child like girl hard as anger entered her eyes. \"You're dead!\" Shouted Saionji as she charged the girl, the large girl not even bothering to react as the petite girl almost sprinted towards her. fury clouding her mind, she jumped just moments before running straight into the girl and stuck out her legs in a double kick towards the girl; however upon impact all that came from it was a small ripple on the girl's belly, the force not all that much as Tsumiki just shrugged it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling onto her bottom, all momentum behind her attack nullified by Tsumiki's blubber, she turned towards her friend and called out to her to get the fatass out of the chair. Receiving a nod from the photographer, both girls began to grab onto the fatty folds of Tsumiki; Saionji just didn't have enough mass to her to even hurt the girl, while Koizumi just didn't have the fighting spirit inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring they could just grab her and take her back to the others, with Saionji thinking she could dish out punishment later to the girl, 'perhaps a baseball bat...' were the girl's dark thoughts as both she and Koizumi began to rock the girl back and forth, trying to get her out of her chair and to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever what neither of them realized was that while there were two of them, one was a rather childlike girl with almost no muscle mass behind her, while the other had perhaps only lifted some camera equipment at the heaviest; thus neither were prepared  to handle the strain of Tsumiki's bulk when the large girl launched forward and deliberately fell on top of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuried under the obese girl's fat, the two struggled to breath, only getting mouthfuls of fat as they tried to move from under the girl. However, Tsumiki kept both pinned under her, enjoying their movements as they squirmed under her until they passed out from lack of oxygen. Giggling to herself, the ultimate nurse rolled off the two and, using the chair, stood herself up with a great amount of effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you two got too tired after playing; oh well, I know what will give you plenty of energy!\" Dragging the two away by their clothes, the fat girl began to move them towards a secret area, the place that she'd helped her lover realize her full potential! \"How about a little snack...\" was the last words Tsumiki spoke as the three of them disappeared into the darkness of the hallway.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakura, Kirigiri, and Komeada walked down the hallway shoulder to shoulder, the combined illumination of their flashlights allowing them to see a good ways in front of them. Hanamura and Kuzuryu were taking up the rear, the suddenly affluent chef watching his (their) back while walking in the shadow of his tall bodyguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, who'd have thought that a place like this had been built under the school?\" He said to try and ease his nerves. \"I spend a ton of time in the cafeteria's kitchen and I had no idea that there was an elevator in the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you never noticed Junko's subordinates frequently coming into the room, disappearing for several hours, and then suddenly re-appearing?\" The detective replied, a trace of snarkiness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say?\" He shrugged with a sheepish grin on his face. \"I am a man who pours all of his focus into his craft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As someone of your Ultimate title should!\" Komadea praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, thanks...\" He responded weakly, taking a closer step behind Sakura in the process. <i>This guy's gotta be bi-polar or something. He seem's cool most of the time, but at the drop of a hat...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook the thought from his head as the expedition continued on through the implausibly long and wide tunnels. When was this place built exactly? It was like a secret fallout shelter made to house a few hundred, or even a few thousand people! And yet at the same time, it all seemed eerily empty and abandoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuzuryu spat on the floor. \"Anyone else feel like we're in a shitty horror movie all of a sudden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, pal.\" Hanamura rolled his eyes. \"That's exactly the thought I needed right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" Komaeda chuckled. \"I think this could be the setting for a very real and completely terrifying horror movie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if responding to his words, A light suddenly began flickering from a room they were just about to pass on the left, causing Hanamura to yelp and clutch Sakura's leg out of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It is alright.\" She reassured him as she brought her fists to bear. \"Nothing shall come to harm you... now would you please let go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh...\" He did as he was told, a small blush coming to his face as he realized the height difference between the two of them his view nearly level with her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir guards up, the five of them entered the room to find a rather luxurious sofa that could easily sit ten people centered around a table that had a video projector on it. As they crossed over to it, the projector suddenly booted up and sent a bright light over to the far wall. Within moments, that bright light coalesced into a live image of Tsumiki sitting in a room that could only be described as the laboratory belonging to the maddest of scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiiiiiii~\" She waved to them all. \"I know we were supposed to be playing hide and seek, but I got bored and decided to search for you instead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsumiki,\" Kirigiri balled her pudgy fists. \"Enough with these games. Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nowhere special,\" She giggled. \"This is just where I've started working on my pet projects recently now that I don't need to sleep anymore!\" She pushed off something and rolled her chair and self away, revealing the sight she had been concealing with her girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a sight it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrapped down in a row of rather comfy looking recliners were none other than their missing classmates: Aoi, Mukuro, Junko, and to everyone's horror, Koizumi and Saionji as well. There was also one more, one that Kuzuryu had never expected to see again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peko!\" He shouted as pure outrage at seeing her limp state filled him. \"What have you done to her you sick freak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sick?\" She paused in thought for a moment. \"Nope! I'm not sick at all!\" She gestured to her captives. \"Everyone else is! One day my all of my friends just stopped doing things and just started laying around like lumps on a log! So, being the most caring and considerate person ever, I took it upon myself to cater to their every need! After all, it's very important for sick people to eat to keep their strength up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the press of a button, a series of hoses dropped from the ceiling and slid down into their mouths while the chairs reclined upwards so that a thick tank of opaque fluid hanging from above, which Kirigiri recognized as the soup form of their cinnamon buns, could safely enter their throats without choking them. Sakura's mouth dropped in horror at the state of undress Aoi was in, her standard red jacket, white tank top, and short shorts replaced with a thin layer of bandages that barely managed to keep her decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mind is more twisted than a Gordian knot.\" She seethed. \"Why have you done this to Asahina? To all of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like I said! I'm just taking care of them until they get better!\" She made a motion of looking at her wrist as if checking the time, though it was apparent to everyone that she wasn't actually wearing a watch. \"Oh! Look's like it's time for dinner! Would any of you care to join us? I made plenty for everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited far too short a time for anyone to actually respond. \"No? Okay, more for my friends then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed two buttons on a remote in her lap, which signaled for the tubes attached to Koizumi and Saionji to start pumping their contents into the two girls. The flow was slow to avoid spillage, though the contents were thick enough that it slid down their throats and settled in their stomachs with a heavy thud. The camera zoomed in on the two of them, giving the audience a second by second look at how their stomachs were slowly bloating up with the melted buns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found these two earlier today, just walking around!\" She grinned. \"They got sick just a few minutes ago, and since they were so skinny to begin with, I had to feed them first so they wouldn't waste away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more fluid poured into them, causing her two tormentors to develop rather noticeable food babies that caused Koizumi's skirt to strain and threatened to undo the knot that kept Saionji's obi tight around her. She pushed her chair over and first gently, then forcefully began prodding their stomachs with her index fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! Drink it all up!\" Her grin widened, causing her to look even more demented. \"You have to keep your strength up when you're sick you know! If you don't, any meal could be your last!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose last words suddenly caused the detective's blood to freeze. <i>She's going to kill them!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" She shouted. Tsumiki spun her chair around to face the camera again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? did you say something?\" The nurse responded, a truly nightmarish look resided on her face now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...If your 'friends' got better, would you let them go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" She nodded. \"If they got better, we could have fun again!\" A fit of giggling took her for a few seconds. \"Not that I'm not having fun right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri turned to Komaeda. \"We have to give her an antidote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that definitely seems to be the only way out of this for Saionji and Koizumi.\" The albino boy mused. \"But if we did that then she would wake Enoshima, and then we would be right back to where we started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we do nothing, then we're just throwing them away!\" She retorted. Emotion rising in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we though?\" He turned to face her. \"They both knew the risks of coming down here. Their sacrifice has given us an idea of where Tsumiki and the others could be located, and I'm sure if we follow the <b><i>HOPE</i></b> in our hearts, we'll be able to track them down-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri grabbed him by the collar. \"I'm not going to play a game with other people's lives the line! We're going to make her an antidote, free everyone, and find another way to stop Tsumiki, understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thought after thought went through Komaeda's head as he thought of the implications of creating an antidote. Creating one would bring back Junko into the world, a force that would surly corrupt Tsumiki and unleash hell for this plan, but on the other hand. On the other hand, if he did nothing, two people would die, and Kirigiri would be against him, possibly others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a situation like this, one could only <i><b>HOPE </b></i>that things worked out, but as it stood, either decision would set his plans back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was near silence for a moment as Kirigiri continued to hold onto Komeda's collar as he thought about his plan. The only sound present was that of the girls being stuffed senseless on the screens, as well as the sound of the fabric on Koizumi and Saionji's starting to tear from their bellies fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirigiri,\" came Komaeda's voice, ringing out to those present. \"I have an idea, but are you sure you want to go through with this?\" The detective, turning her sight to see the straining bellies of her fellow students, quickly turned back and nodded. Instead of addressing her response, Komaeda turned towards Sakura. \"And you, Sakura, can I assume you will help as well?\" The once buff teenage girl looked over the fellow students, the sight of her friend Asahina in such a state sending chills up her spine. \"I shall as well, whatever the idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Komaeda removed himself from Kirigiri's meaty hands as he turned to face Tsumiki, putting a rather cheerful face on to address his once close friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsumiki, I think I have a solution to our problem~!\" The way he responded made the others think of Tsumiki's new persona, as his voice seemed to hold no malice whatsoever and even sounded rather childlike. \"How about we take some of your patients to see a doctor? I'm sure that they could help get you some medicine for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan seemed almost destined to fail, as Tsumiki immediately began to shake her head, the shock of which jiggled her belly and breasts, showing how against the idea she was. \"Nonononono, Can't do that. They have to get better before I can let them go~.\" Komaeda didn't seem at all put out by the response, as he instead began to  try and reason with the disillusioned girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if the sickness is too much and they don't get better? They could be sick forever, and you don't want that, now do you?\" A bit of doubt flashed in the insane girl's eyes as Komaeda immediately jumped on that. \"How about this, we take those two new girls and bring them to a doctor to see how their sickness is, we'll then bring some medicine down when we've cured them. How's that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven a novice poker player could see that the idea was starting to appeal to her, but it would still take a bit of work to convince her. \"But what's to keep you from taking them and not returning; I can't have you dining and dashing on me, now can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grin Komaeda spotted was enough for Kirigiri to know what he was planning, and judging by Sakura's small growl behind her, the detective knew that she'd come to the same conclusion as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a trade then? If they get sick, you can just take care of them until we get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Komaeda's mind, the plan was simple. Trade Sakura and Kirigiri for the two girls and once they were gone, bring down a cure later. Junko looked to be nearly immobile at this point, and even if she was brought back to her senses, with her and her sister so out of shape, for them to maneuver around would be dificult to say the least. Sakura and Kirigiri could handle the added food, Kirigiri already rather plump, while Sakura's body had been trained to handle extreme amounts of force for training. They could handle the pressure without dying, and in Kirigiri's case probably without any pain, until the cure could be made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tsumiki thought about the plan, the others gathered in a huddle, Kirigiri close to losing her composure and beating the crap out of the pale hope fulled student next to her. \"What was that, Komaeda?!\" came Hanamura's hushed voice as he hated the idea of losing his bodyguard to Komaeda's plan. \"Hanamura's right, how the hell are throwing Sakura and Kirigiri to the mad bitch gonna help this?\" Kuzuryu's angered voice followed, however that may be due to the fact that he just witnessed his girl being held hostage by a crazed nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two were silences as Sakura's hands fell on their shoulders, the two looking up and seeing the stone like visage on the warrior's face. Despite the fact she now looked like a girl (a rather hot one as Hanamura would say), she was still a warrior at heart, and would gladly put her self on the line for what was right. \"I'll do it,\" came the girls voice as she turned to look at Kirigiri, awaiting conformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the girls look, and knowing that this was the only alternative, she nodded her head to the girls silent question before turning to look at Komaeda. \"How long will it take to get an antidote down here?\" Hoping that it would be a short while, her plea was unanswered as Komaeda dropped the bomb. \"A few days, depends on how long it takes for me to reach my source and develop a cure. It could even possibly take a week if the chemical is as resistant as we designed it. All we can do is <i><b>HOPE </b></i>it doesn't take long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week, that was all Kirigiri could focus on. In just a few weeks weeks Asahina looked close to rolling around than walking, and now she'd have to subject herself to the same thing? Gulping a little and almost letting herself show her worry, she just silently nodded, her face remaining ice cold. Looking over at Asahina, she could see the same thing in the martial artists eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DEAL!\" Came Tsumiki's cry as she spun around in her chair, either not hearing or not caring about the conversation that had transpired in the group. The screen flashed to a picture of a map, as it began to point towards a room. As the group began to make their journey to what they assumed was the 'drop off point', Kirigiri felt as if she was walking towards her own execution.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately at home she could not achieve her dream, but on this island things were different. Still there was one thing that bothered her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat boy Souda. He was always staring at her with the desire of a child watching a Disney movie.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"We made it so far- we began to get past who we were; what we had done. All of us were monsters. But because of one boy, we were given a second chance, one that was nearly ruined by the same force that made us into the monsters we had become. There would be no shortcut to our redemption, but in the end we succeeded in breaking through who we once were, and saw again, the hope past the despair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{iUgh, what hit me?}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane Owari opened her eyes to a gray sky dominated by enormous black skyscrapers. The sound of  honking car alarms and construction work rang through the air, making the SHSL Gymnast's budding headache far more painful than it should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit, where the hell am I?</i> Owari picked herself off the block of sidewalk she was laying sprawled out on with a quick front flip and gazed around the street block. It looked like it could pass as any old downtown shopping strip, with the exception that every single building was some sort of restaurant. There was every type of food that Owari could even think of available: Italian pasta, Korean barbecue, Indian curry, American pizza... the list went on. So much so that Owari stopped taking note of them all and turned her attention back to the barbecue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey, meat actually sounds great right about now!</i> Owari licked her lips in anticipation and reached into her shirt pocket to grab her wallet. \"..Hey, where the hell is my wallet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gymnast quickly glanced around the city for anyone suspicious she could hopefully beat her wallet out of. Unfortunately there was no one who looked justifiably suspicious enough. In fact, there didn't appear to be anyone around at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Hello? Is anyone around? Some punk jacked my wallet and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwari's question tapered off as she saw a big, multi-story neon light sign, which read \"City council meeting- move fatasses!\" and had an arrow below that pointed around the corner of the block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah, that must be it! Everyone in town must be at that meeting... </i> Owari grinned at her successful deduction. She knew that figuring stuff out wasn't her strong suit, but whenever she did piece something together she was proud. <i>Well, I've never been good at politics, but someone there must know who took my wallet!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the gymnast rushed down another block of eateries and nearly ran head first into an enormous statue of what looked to be a stuffed animal pig with two short tusks jutting out from underneath the snout. Two such statues stood at the entrance of a large domed building which featured a dark brown double door with pig carvings on the handles, Corinthian pillars, and a huge marble staircase that led up to the ornately decorated entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh, fancy... a little too fancy if you ask me...</i> Owari shrugged and dashed up the stairs, kicking the large brown door open with far more force than was needed to simply open it. As soon as the door swung open, Owari saw rows of wooden benches that led up to a series of 7 raised seats at the back wall of the room that overlooked the rest of yet another overly designed setup. As she glanced around the room, Owari spotted the source of the conversation she had heard earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey guys!\" The SHSL Gymanst was exited to see that her friends from the island again, especially after her rather odd awakening. From left to right, Sonia, Saionji, Ibuki, Koizumi, Tsumiki, and Pekoyama stood gathered near one of the benches. All with various looks of confusion and concern on their faces. \"Any chance you six saw who took my wallet? That punk is in for a world of hurt!\" Owari cracked her knuckles in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wallet?! Your stupid face is worried about your wallet when we're stuck in some dirty city!\" The SHSL dancer childishly shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" The gymnast took a step back in shock. \"What do you mean we're stuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-exactly that! There's no way out of the city! No trains, no buses, a-and if you walk too far, there's just a wall of buildings blocking your path! I'm sorry I couldn't find a way out! Please forgive me!\" Tsumiki fell to her knees and began breaking down in tears<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up you worthless stupid head!\" Saionji gave the SHSL Nurse a kick to the side. \"No one wants to hear what you have to say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to antagonize her like that, there are more important matters to attend to.\" Pekoyama adjusted her glasses an folded her arms. \"Like finding where the young master and the others wound up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" Owari suddenly noticed the complete lack of their male associates in the room. \"Where's Nidai hiding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't think you need to worry about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a small black and white stuffed pig descended from the rafters and landed into the middle of the seven raised seats in the back of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-m-m-Monobear!\" Tsumiki screamed and huddled into a ball on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Where?\" The pig toy looked around the room. \"Oh, you're talking to me! Well, listen up toots, I'm not Monobear, I'm Mono<i>boar!</i> Get it? Isn't that just hilarious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonoboar waited about ten seconds, hoping for some sort of laughter or applause at how clever his name was. \"...Well anyway, the point is I ain't no bear! We're playing a new game now!\" \"What kind of game you ask? A game of gains, you might say! A play of plentifulness! A scrum of succulence! A-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonoboar paused to cough for a few seconds, before resuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, the point is you're all going to get really, really fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" All of the SHSL students asked simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! This series hasn't had a single fatty girl in two games. We owe it to our FA readers to show them some love! That's why I devised this little game for you all to play! The rules are simple: Eat as much as you fucking can and pack on those pounds! You all are now part of red team! And you're competing against you're fellow SHSL girls from the first game to see which team can push their waistbands out more! The team that fails to fatten the most will be on the chopping block each week, and then the losers will have to vote to punish one of their own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished, 14 banners unfolded along the left hand wall. The first seven depicted each of them over a red background. To the side of each of their heads was their SHSL title along with their current weight. Owari glanced at hers: 56 kilograms. A fine weight for her age and athletic level. Would she really have to get fat for a toy pig?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we refuse to play your game?\" Pekoyama asked, knowing full well what the answer would likely be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Refuse to play? Well shucks, I thought you all would just go along with it...I guess I'll just let you go then...\" Monoboar looked at the ground and teared up slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?\" Tsumiki nervously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! You're all trapped here until I decide to let you go!\" Immediately Monoboar jumped back to his impassioned rant. \"Look at it this way, all of you can try and keep your supermodel figures, but what happens if someone on the other team gains a single pound? Then you'll all be dragged here and have to vote to punish one of your own! You might all be friends, but can you trust the other team to think about your interests above their own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwari nervously bit her lip. This was bad. It was just like what happened back on the island. A lot of talk about trust and betrayal that she didn't fully get. She had always left the hard thinking to others. One thing she had learned though, was that attacking the toy head on would never work. A lesson she had learned at the cost of Nidai's human body; which he lost protecting her from a rocket. A sacrifice she could never forget...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, one last thing! The first person from either team to double their starting weight gets to be my mayoral assistant! What are the perks you might ask? A steady job, good pay, and complete immunity from being punished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the girls stood motionless in the room, overcome with a similar feeling of despair that had gripped them in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's everything girls! I took the liberty of passing out your Despair City passports while I was speaking. Boy, are these things cool! They get you into any restaurant in town, have a built in map of the city, and gives you a live display of your current weight and \"battle stats\" if you know what I mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwari patted her shirt pocket, and suddenly found a virtual book where her wallet once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonoboar suddenly sounded impatient. \"Are you all still here? Go on, schoo, scram! You're belly isn't going to stuff itself!\"</span></div></div>",

The other girls were in fact eating but not at a competitive speed, nothing to overly concern oneself over.  \"Yes, Monoboar did say that the team that puts on the most weight avoids punishment, so according to the rules we only need to weigh 1 measly pound more than those girls.\" reasoned Sonia displaying a reliving demeanor.  \"Yeah keeping our hot thin bodies shouldn't be too hard.\" Ibuki struck a rocker pose boasting her confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know just look at Junko.\" Tsumiki pointed a shaking finger at the ultimate fashionita sitting at a burger joint gleefully stuffing her face with burgers. The girls grew slightly anxious at the sight of Junko surrounded by empty wrappers. \"Umm look over there.\" Koizumi further dissipating their cool by turning everyone's attention to the swimmer Aoi enjoying herself at a donut shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there in a city consisting solely of restaurants, the girls grasped the gravity of the game. There were too many girls who were too happy to indulge to hope for winning by gaining minimal weight. Their team was going to have to gain some serious mass if they wished to avoid punishment, whatever horror that could be. Although that didn't mean that every girl had to gain, they could dump the responsibility on the other girls, or perhaps even one girl. That conniving thought ran through their heads. But than the first girl to double her weight would receive the benefit of becoming Monoboar's mayoral assistant which meant immunity from punishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lingering scent of barbecue flowed through the air. \"Man that smells damn good.\" Owari had been craving some succulent meat for a while now. \"Heh heh I'm gonna use this and get me some meat.\" Owari grinned as she pulled out her Despair City passport and ran over to the barbecue restaurant. For the moment Owari only cared about sampling some delicious hearty meat, the concern of gaining weight or the competition fretted her not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the other girls went off in search of nourishment, acknowledging the reality of their predicament.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane Owari enters the barbecue establishment and...</span></div></div>",

Having lived a life of poverty, Akane never managed to satisfy her voracious appetite until she became a gymnast. She even resorted to selling her panties. Owari was going to take full advantage of Monoboar's game, finally filling her bottomless stomach, a challenge Akane could never accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entrance, Akane noticed that the joint was completely automated. \"Huh? Where's all the people?\" Akane wondered gazing into a seemingly deserted restaurant. \"It's all automation.\" Akane turned to see who answered her question. \"The whole city is operated by machines. The only inhabitants are the female students of Hope's academy or rather  the contestants of Monoboar's game.\"  answered a purple eyed, lavender haired girl with a braid on the side. \"Well how am I gonna get my food?!\" Akane wasn't too sharp when it came to dealing with the unorthodox. \"Simple just insert your passport into the monitor and choose what you want.\" \"Sweet!\" Owari exclaimed swiftly activated the monitor and oogled the screen. \"Oh This one, this one! Ooh I gotta have that! Oh and that too!\" Owari squealed as she placed her order. Within moments Akane's order rolled in on a conveyor belt. \"Yummy!\" Akane picked up her meal and sat at the table were the lavender haired girl was. She was wiping her mouth after having eating a slab of ribs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was surprised by Akane's huge order, sure this was a weight gain competition but starting so big so early, how ambitious was this tan skinned girl? Akane plopped her huge meal down and dove right in. \"Hey how come you didn't take yer gloves off? Aren't you worried they'll get messy?\" Akane asked noticing the girl's unusual apparel. \"It is not a problem for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane rapidly consumed her savory barbecued meat. \"So who are you? You on the other team?\" Akane inquired after swallowing huge gulps of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed my name is Kyoko Kirigiri and like you I was also forced to participate in Monoboar's game. I just can't perceive why anyone would go to such lengths to make a bunch of girls fat. Considering an entire city and limitless food has been provided.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, all I know is that we get all the food we want for free.\" Akane muttered as she was biting into meat smothered in sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I intend to uncover what's going on.\" Kyoko got up and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You done already?! You barely ate!\" Akane yelled noticing Kirigiri's subjectively small serving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only intend on gaining enough weight to prolong punishment.\" Kyoko informed pulling out her Despair City passport to check her weight. \"110 pounds, up 4 pounds.\" said Kirigiri placing her gloved hand on her full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a light weight. I'm gonna eat til I drop!\" declared Akane initiating a voracious stuffing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Getting all this free food!\" she declared still shoving food in her mouth as the words left her mouth. Akane kept cramming more and more meat in her maw. It was quite the spectacle how much Akane devoured, she was literally inhuman. However Akane's voracity subsided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! That was tasty!\" Exhaled a stuffed Akane patting her swollen belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amount of meat that the tanned skinned girl filled her belly with would have sedated anyone, but given her inexplicable energy, Akane only felt invigorated. \"Oh yeah! I always feel so alive when I can stuff myself silly!\" Akane clenched her fists as her body surged with energy. Akane launched out of the barbecue joint, fueled by the urge to use her freshly acquired energy. Despite possessing a full stomach that rendered her shirt taut, Akane darted across the empty town in a parkour type manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stimulated girl sprinted throughout the town garnering much attention. Akane bolted by Kyoko who was caressing her satisfied gut. \"How assuring, the girl from the other team with a concerning appetite is victim to an unyielding drive. Looks like the competition won't be as difficult as expected if the girls burn off their calories.\" Kyoko said watching the auspicious sight. Akane than passed Peko who was sitting on a bench soothing her stressed stomach. \"What is that idiotic girl doing? Doesn't she realize this is a weight gaining game?\" Up next was Aoi lazing in a donut shop. \"Huh!? Why is she running around aren't we supposed to get fat?\" questioned the donut filled Aoi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes fell upon the exhilarated Akane, particularly those of her team. \"We've got to do something about Akane.\" Ibuki demanded placing her palm on her developing gut. \"I ate more than I planned and I don't want it to be for nothing.\" \"Indeed although having an impressive appetite, Akane also possesses boundless energy.\" added Sonia. \"If we could stifle Akane's energy, her hunger would quickly fatten Akane up.\" reasoned Koizumi. \"We'll just have to break her!\" Hiyoko balled her fists. \"But how do we extinguish Owari's vitality?\" Peko wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team decided that they would have to keep Akane eating at all times until her urge to exercise died. All sorts of plans emerged from eating with Owari encouraging her to eat even when she's full at the cost of the own girl's waistline. Then there was also force,perhaps force feeding her would be the best option or they could resort to energy killing drugs, that could be the most productive solution.

We'll take shifts, alternating turns after each meal.\" proposed Pekoyama. \"But how do we make sure Owari will eat with us rather than run off?\" questioned Sonia. \"Simple, we'll challenge her if we have to. Akane can't resist a challenge. Yeah!\" Ibuki stated sticking her tongue out and raising a fist in the air.  \"And if you fail I'll force the food down your throat!\" added the abusive Hiyoko aiming her threat towards the ultimate nurse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides any weight we gain will help us avoid punishment\" Pekoyama's truthful words reminded the ladies of the current situation at hand. \"Plus we should all do our fair share and put on some weight.\" Sonia encouraged patting her belly. \"But dude how much food will it take to bring that down? She's a machine.\" Ibuki pointed her finger at Owari swinging on a light post.  \"S-she'll out eat every one of us.\" trembled Tsumiki feeling weak in the knees. \"Let's not worry too much, if its food related, Owari will happily comply. Plus we are in a city made solely out of restaurants were everything is free.\" Sonia pulled out her Despair city passport, now reading 115 pounds (5 more pounds) stirring up some motivation in the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like Akane, the girls all enjoyed the comforts of food. Perhaps even subconsciously they loved the competition that was forced upon them. Finally they were given an excuse to indulge, given a reason to eat as much as they wanted, having the liberty to eat their favorite high calorie dishes. However they were burdened by the thought of their hard earned slender bodies becoming smothered in fat. Pressured to sacrifice their coveted figures just for some Monoboar's demented game out of the fear of punishment. This looming threat filled some of the girls with despair, especially since some girls appeared to be reveling in this city of artery clogging foods. Owari wanted meats, Aoi stuffed herself with donuts, and Junko seemed to be gorging on everything.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the plan of eating with Akane to suppress her activity established, the girls look at each other curious of who Akane's first partner will be.\"I guess I'll go first\" Koizumi signaled the pumped up Owari who was scaling a building. Koizumi took a big gulp \"Hey Akane how bout you and me grab some burgers?\"  The photographer's words attracted the gymnast and in the blink of an eye, Akane rushed to the red head.  \"Hell yeah that run got me starvin' let's eat!\" smiled Akane as she grabbed and hauled off Koizumi who begun regretting volunteering her stomach for this mission. The other girls watched on as Koizumi was dragged into the burger joint, clutching their full bellies in anticipation of their turn.</span></div></div>",

Akane's enthusiasm was noticed by all particularly catching the eye of a certain lavender haired detective. \"Hmm it appears that that Owari girl is hungry again.\" Kirigiri observed \"Hopefully she'll live up to her gymnast title and burn all of her caloric intake away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirigiri walked along the sidewalk, passing countless restaurants. The variety offered to the girls was nothing short of impressive. Clearly Monoboar (or whoever was was in control)spared no expense ensuring that the girls received all appetizing foods optimum for gaining weight. Anything their expanding stomachs could want, why would anyone go to such great lengths or rather how could they. Kirigiri was trying to ascertain a reason for Monoboar's urge to watch the girls of Hope's Peak Academy fatten up. Was it to humiliate them? to watch them lose any physical prowess? to make a statement? to alter women's weights around the world? Postulations were running throughout the detective's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking along the path, Kirigiri bumped into a fellow teammate. \"Ophff\" Kirigiri raises her eyes to see that she had bumped into a noticibly heavier Aoi. \"Oh sorry Kyoko.\" moaned Aoi. \"It's alright I was just lost in thought.\" Kirigiri admitted. \"Are you okay Kyoko?\" \"Yes I'm alr- Aoi!\" Kirigiri stopped mid-sentance as she caught sight of the swimmer's protruding gut. Aoi had an exhausted look on her face, obviously from an overconsumption of donuts. \"Aoi just how many donuts did you eat?\" Despite seeing Kyoko's concern, Aoi retained her nonchalant demeanor. \"Heh heh I lost track after the first few dozens.\" Aoi smiled raising her hand behind her head. \"Besides this is a weight gain competition Kyoko. And how could you expect me to pass up an endless supply of free donuts?\" smirked the tan swimmer placing her hands on her softened hips. Kyoko sighed \"Well I suppose the weight you've gained is beneficial for the team...\" \"But I plan on figuring out the true motives for Monoboar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd everywhere Kirigiri looked she saw her fellow classmates indulging. Were they really that concerned with Monoboar's demented game? Or was it simply an excuse to give in to some voracious instinct?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey where's my fifth order of cheese fries?!\" The two heard a familiar voice yell. Kyoko and Aoi turn their heads to find none other than Junko Enoshima sitting in a booth surrounded by automated monoboars. \"I need more chicken strips! And you better not skimp on the sauce!\" Kyoko and Aoi walk up to the window to further study Junko. Here was the ultimate fashionita shoveling numerous rounds of unhealthy dishes in her salivating mouth. \"Why is she eating so furiously? Could it be to double her weight and attain the position of Monoboar's mayoral assistant.\" Kirigiri pondered over Junko's mysterious motives. Kyoko than noticed Junko's straining top, each button nearing to burst, causing the detective to expect launching projectiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the detective smelled the tantalizing aroma of the burgers. <br>\r\nGRUMBLE<br>\r\n\"Hey sounds like somebody's hungry.\" laughed Aoi poking her friend in her belly. \"I already ate ribs at that barbecue restaurant.\" Kyoko said before getting interrupted by her insisting stomach. Kyoko blushed and capitulated to her hunger \"Well, a heavier weight is required to avoid punishment, so I suppose some indulging is permissible.\" Kyoko and Aoi, who herself suddenly found her appetite again, entered the burger joint were a gorging Junko was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Akane was shoveling burgers in her face while Koizumi desperately tried to keep up. \"Come on it's like you're not even trying.\" The words barely passed through the chewed burger in Akane's mouth. \"but this is my eighth burger Akane.\" Koizumi's exasperated words proved humorous to Akane. \"Ha ha Eight's nothing! Come on, eat up!\" a hearty Akane smacked Koizumi's back. \"Here I'll help ya out.\" the insisting gymnast forced a greasy cheeseburger in the photographer's freckled face. \"Too much\" Koizumi attempted to say but found her mouth stuffed by the overwhelming burger. Koizumi clenched her fists as she suffered the high calorie sandwich sliding down her throat. After both girls ate a few more burgers, Akane was satisfied with Koizumi left in a exhausted state possessing a dazed countenance unquestionably defeated by Akane's daunting voracity, no longer able to keep Akane eating.</span></div></div>",

Withholding the urge to beat her chest, Owari eyed the city as if it were a fun obstacle course overflowing with objects to jump on. Her teammates were waiting for her with Ibuki on standby to quell Owari's energy.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Hey Akane!\" Ibuki called out stopping Akane from initiating another calorie burning escapade. \"Wanna go get some more of these bombtastic kabobs with me?\" enticed the rocker girl holding a tasty looking kakab. Despite having just finishing off tons of burger calories, Owari drooled as the kabob's steam flowed into her nostrils. \"You bet! those look delicious.\" Ibuki leaped over to Akane and pushed the kakobs into Owari's lips, happy to accommodate the flavorful meat. \"Less talk more stuff face!\" Ibuki said heading off with Owari pushing her closer to obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there she goes.\" said Peko all too aware of the endeavor that Ibuki was about to endure. \"Good luck Ibuki\" prayed Sonia. quivered the worried Tsumiki. \"How is Koizumi faring?\" asked the silver-haired swordswoman. Just looking at the freckled red head's face made the nurse quiver. \"S-she's not looking too good. Her face is blue and her belly is huge.\" Tsumiki trembled. \"I'm okay.\" Koizumi softly uttered \"I just need a little time to digest.\" she panted pulling out her Despair City passport. \"117 pounds. I've put on over 15 pounds heh heh.\" she read aloud rubbing her bloated stomach. \"Fret not Koizumi, every pound you gain benefits the team.\" Peko's true words comforted the full girl. \"And you've brought Owari closer to sloth.\" Sonia added. \"I'm glad my eating help out.\" puffed Koizumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Owari was with Ibuki both savoring the skewered meats. \"Open wide.\" ordered Ibuki. \"Hit me.\" Akane replied with her mouth wide open, anxious for more. \"Yahoo!\" Ibuki yelled as she shoved a kabob in Owari's hungry chompers. Owari than excitedly munched on the juicy skewer.  Ibuki sunk her teeth into the pierced foods as well. Like Akane, Ibuki was hungry too and the excitement from eating with a girl like Akane only made the rocker more hungry. \"Whooo! I don't know about you Akane, but all of these crazy tasty meats are getting me stoked and totally hungry-mungry.\" Ibuki biting some meat off the skewer. \"Yeah, I'm gonna stuff myself like there's no tomorrow.\" declared the hyped-up gymnast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane and Ibuki than began gorging upon the succulent kabobs. Automated monoboars worked ceaselessly to supply the two women with herculean appetites. It was as if each girl fueled the other's hunger. Orders after orders were consumed by the ravenous girls until Ibuki met her limit. \"Uhh no more.\" Ibuki pleaded. \"Ha ha! You sure ate more than I expected. More than that freckled girl. I guess you aren't as weak as I thought huh.\" Akane praised the striped haired girl barely retaining consciousness, patting her on the back. Ibuki than caught sight of Akane realizing that both of them now possessed protruding bellies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane picked up Ibuki and helped her walk out. \"I bet we put on some major weight.\" moaned Ibuki. \"Eh who cares, all I care about is eating until I'm not hungry anymore.\" Owari lightheartedly admitted. \"But what about the competition?\"  \"Huh what competition?\" the absent minded Owari asked. \"You know Monoboar's game. The game to make all the Hope's Peak Academy girls fat. The game that pitted our class against the other SHSL girls. The very reason why all of this food is free.\" the musician further attempted to by whipping out her Despair City passport.  \"Oh yeah that thing! All I know is that this baby gets me free food.\" Akane stated pulling out hers as well. \"This doesn't just pay for our food it also tells us our stats, like you know our weights.\" Ibuki demonstrated \"See I'm 114 pounds.I gained 22 pounds since this competition started.\" Ibuki Mioda informed. \"Oh okay.\" Owari than takes a closer look at her passport \"Let's see what I weigh...152 pounds. Whoa I don't think I weighed that much before!\" Akane blurted out somewhat impressed.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the additional 29 pounds, the tan gymnast felt the urge to train, if only Nidai was there.

Tsumiki grew even more nervous as she glanced at Owari's expanded belly bursting underneath her shirt and hanging over her skirt \"You see I can't find the um you know, ice cream parlor..\" Owari's eyes glistened as a smile formed on her face. \"I help ya out.

The two were enjoying several pieces of cake and tea while ensuring Tsumiki prevented any exercise that Owari may perform. \"I have to admit I was a little worried that Tsumiki might've botched her mission.\" Peko commented as she dug into her cake with her fork. \"Ha she's such a screw-up.\" the harsh dancer criticized while washing down her cake with some sweet tea. \"Owari's appetite is the key to victory. As long as we stop her from her physical antics, we'll avoid that demented Monoboar's punishment.\" Peko explained while signaling an automated monoboar for more cake. \"And who would've thought that Mioda had such an appetite.\" Saionji added. \"Indeed, that was- oh thank you\" Peko's words are interrupted as a monoboar places a large cake on the table. \"That was a pleasant surprise.\" Peko finished now anxious slicing up the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see oh here it is! Score!\" rejoiced Owari standing beneath the ice cream parlor. \"Oh splendid. Oh I'm sorry. Did I get too excited?\"Tsumiki groveled. \"Huh? Who cares about that let's eat!\" Owari grabbed Tsumiki's arm and dragged her into the shop. The two were immediately bombarded by various flavors. \"Oh boy they all look so good!\" Owari licked her lips. \"Yes we should try them all. Sorry did I go too far with that suggestion?\" the nervous nurse apologized yet again. \"Stop with that apologizing and start eating.\" instructed Akane taking a cone from a helpful monoboar. Each girl began swallowing tonguefuls of ice cream, raising their stats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Aoi was fanning a very bloated Kyoko outside the fastfood joint from earlier. \"Jeez Kyoko I can't believe you ate that much. I mean you didn't save any room for donuts.\" \"I made the mistake of allowing myself to be distracted by Enoshima's voracity that I didn't realize how many servings I ate.\" confessed a shamed Kirigiri. \"I kept ordering more excusing it with Monoboar's weight gain competition without realizing just how much I was eating.\" the lavender haired girl looked down at her belly. The buttons on her shirt were nearing popping and the seams were close to ripping. \"I should have been more alert.\" groaned Kirigiri. \"Eating like this could be detrimental to my sleuthing abilities.\" \"Hey everybody makes mistakes, I ate way more than I thought I would. Plus Its a good thing we ate so much, it just means we're less likely to be punished.\" Asahina's words were soothing to the engorged Kyoko. \"Now whaddaya say we go get some yummy donuts.\" Aoi suggested. Kirigiri silently complied accompanying the swimmer to the donut shop all the while contemplating Junko's gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aoi led Kirigiri off, Junko watched with a devious smile on her face. \"Oh yeah Aoi, hungry girl, go you. Way to let your belly talk.\" Junko took a bite of fried chicken from the bucket she held between her soft side and her flabby arm staring at the two girls' swollen bellies.  \"Just you wait. This is like, only the beginning Kyoko honey.\" Junko muffled her mouth filled with the greasy fried food. Polishing off the bone, she tossed it disregarding wherever it landed. Reaching for another piece to nourishing her demanding belly, Junko found the bucket already emptied. \"Say what!? Empty already? gah la-ame. Whose bright idea was it to make these things so small!?\" Junko threw the empty bucket away. \"Hmmph whatever I was tired of fried chicken anyhow.\" Junko whined like a brat before suddenly changing into a more positive personality. \"Now to find something even more yummy-wummy.\" she said making a cute pose that one would expect of an innocent girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the ice cream parlor, Tsumiki was sitting in a chair staring at the ceiling. \"Ugggh I'm sorry, I can''t...eat...any...more.\" the overwhelmed nurse moaned. Akane was licking another ice cream cone \"Alright I'll just get another cone before we leave.\" It was astonishing how tenacious Owari's stomach was, consuming such massive quantities of food without succumbing. Akane walked out with Tsumiki, now walking a bit slower due to her accumulating weight even panting a little. To her team's joy, the gymnast was losing her physical prowess.   </span></div></div>",

Despite her regal status, she felt obligated to contribute to fattening Owari, even if that meant getting fat herself. \"Boy you're a light weight, getting full from a little ice cream.\" Akane boasted helping Tsumiki walk out. \"I'm sorry\" groaned Tsumiki still in character despite of her icecream filled belly. Upon setting foot on the sidewalk, Sonia saw the results of everyone's hard work. Akane was fat. The most apparent attribute was her bigger boobs, bursting out of her barely buttoned shirt. Then there was her huge belly swelling out from under her shirt. The tanned globe was firm from all of her recent feedings. Her limbs had developed a layer of flab, any muscle tone had now vanished beneath the newly formed softness. Even her ass, once tight, was now beginning to sag no longer retaining its petite form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you two enjoy your ice cream?\" Sonia asked. Akane finished her cone in a quick set of gulps \"Yeah I needed somethin' sweet to go with all the meat I've been eatin'.\" Akane answered unlike Tsumiki who remained silent, too full to reply.  \"Yeah Tsumiki here couldn't find the place so I helped her. Then I rewarded myself with a little treat.\" Akane slaps her belly. \"You know I was actually getting a little tired of meat. You can't always eat it even though it's tender, succulent, and savory-Oh man now I want meat!\" The girl made herself hungry by her own words.  Sonia seized the moment and attained Owari's attention by pulling out a steak house menu \"They say that this place has the best steak in town.\" Sonia's enticing words captured  the gymnast who now, in spite of already smothering her slender body with fat, found herself plagued by hunger yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust looking at the menu made Akane drool. \"Oh yeah! I'm ready to EAT!\" Sonia suddenly found herself in Akane's clutches being hauled off to the steak house. With her soft arm Akane fiercely pressed the Novoselic princess into her soft squishy rolls, with one of Akane's tits resting on Sonia's forehead. Having the gymnast exactly were she wanted her, Sonia couldn't help but find Owari's ceaseless hunger curious \"Um Akane are you really that hungry? I mean you've been eating so much since this game started.\" \"If you're hungry, than eat more. Eating's top priority y'know.\" a simple answer, one you'd expect from a girl like Owari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh here we are.\" Sonia said still being squeezed against Akane's warm chunky side with a boob still in her face. Akane was panting \"Meat, meat, meat...\" Akane jumped in the establishment wielding her passport for her free food. Automated monoboars were on hand, eager to feed the girls to their heart's content. \"Gimme meat! I'm gonna eat til I pass out!\" shouted Akane. Sonia was also looking forward to the steaks though finding Owari's overwhelming enthusiaism a tad intimidating. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kaede sat in the dining hall with Shuichi, Kaito, Miu and K1-B0, or Kiibo. Miu was flirting with Kiibo, pushing her body against his as he nervously tried to move away. Kaito was chatting with Shuichi. Kaede smiled, it had been a few days since Monokuma had been destroyed and the Kubs had all left the school. To make matters better, Miu, despite what Kaede thought of her, had created a distress beacon, and the signal had been picked up, with confirmation of rescue arriving in two weeks. Just like she thought, everyone was going to make it out of here alive together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaede turned to look at Shuichi, his cap taken off. Over the several weeks that they'd spent together, Kaede had grown to have feelings for Shuichi, and it was obvious to anyone with eyes that he had feelings for her too. He was so sweet and kind, and he'd done so much. It was because of his plan that they stopped Tsumugi from killing Rantaro or any of the rest of them, and, by extension, why they could be saved. He had done so much for her, she felt like she needed to pay him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment that they heard heavy footsteps running from down the hallway. Kokichi Ouma, the Ultimate Supreme Leader, sprang into the dining hall. He was sweating from sprinting a long way, holding something behind his back, and grinning mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oiiiii! I hope you don't mind, Shuichi! But I've taken the liberty of raiding your room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi sprang to his feet, a nervous look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Ouma! W-Why would you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just that you didn't properly shut your door all the way, and I was curious! I just HAD to look in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's besides the point! You s-shouldn't have done that regardless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaede raised her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! What gives you the right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaito stood up, enthused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! How dare you raid my assistant's room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaede, Kaito...\" Shuichi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiibo looked to Ouma as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct. You should not have done this, Kokichi. It was amoral.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKokichi put on a faux sad face as he whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I thought it'd be funny... Waaaaaaaaahhhhhh! You guys are so meaaaaaaaan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, Miu spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Shitlord! What, did you find his porn or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, Ouma's face lit up into one of glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi turned pale as Miu started cackling hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you found his porn mags? Kyahahahaha! Ah, you're so fuckin' lonely, Sluthara! See, what'd I say? Only perverts wear hats, ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi nervously tried to argue back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's not it! I-uh, A-Ah, no. I-I, uh-don't have anything like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaede sat, listening. She guessed that it wasn't surprising that Shuichi had magazines, although, that was assuming Ouma was telling the truth. However, as she looked at the fiercely flushed Shuichi, she knew Ouma was dead on. However, Kaede wasn't going to judge him for what he did in his private time, in fact, she was looking forward to finding out what kind of women Shuichi was into. Kaito spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Shuichi! It doesn't matter what Ouma says, I know he's just lying again! I believe in you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Kaito! I admire your optimism, but these are all 100% Saihara's! The contents may surprise you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was interesting, Kaede thought. Did such a quiet and nervous boy have deviant tastes. Kaede was watching intently, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi was taken back again, as he was less flushed and more pale, as if this had gone from embarrassment to fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Ouma, don't, please..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho ho! So you admit they're yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh- What? No, no, they aren't mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure <i>these</i> don't look familiar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuma pulled a bunch of magazines out from behind his back. They all featured something in common. The models on the covers all had, big, round, smooth bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi almost froze in place as Kaede observed the magazines. So, Shuichi was into big girls? She'd heard about that before. It didn't seem so bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was pierced by ear damaging laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYAHAHAHA! So, Sluthara likes fat chicks, huh? You're more of a fuckin' loser than I thought!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was when Kiibo chimed in, trying to be helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wait, Miu. I have heard this is one of the more common, um, 'fetishes'? Is that the word?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKey word being 'trying.' Kaito chimed in, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, this is all just Ouma's plan! I know my assistant, and I know he's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that Shuichi walked out of the room, blushing violently. Everyone was in stunned silence, except for Miu, who was laughing in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaede stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going after him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked past Ouma, she snatched Shuichi's magazines from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left the cafeteria, she saw Shuichi turning the corner, speed-walking away. She ran after him, shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Shuichi! Shuichi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped and turned as she came to as stop in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kaede?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, Shuichi! I'd just like to say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi interrupted, looking at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that I didn't say anything sooner, Kae-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I don't care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi was taken by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if you like your girls skinny or curvy or chubby or big or whatever! You're still the same boy that's been so sweet this whole time! I'd have to be a real cow for this to change anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi was taken by surprise as he blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaede...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, you've done so much for me, for all of us, I owe it to you to give it a shot, if It makes you happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm saying I'll let you stuff me, jeez!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuichi's face turned into a smile as he drew Kaede into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaede, t-thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drew away, he said...</span></div></div>",

The young detective was about to break it to his lovely girlfriend of a few years, Kaede Akamatsu, that he had a little bit of a fetish. This kink of his was that, well, he liked his women... larger, to say the least. Naturally, he was quite concerned as to how Kaede would react? Would she slap him? Would she dump him over this?! No, no, he needed to think straight. Kaede was understanding! She might not want to gain weight for him, but she certainly wouldn't break off a 3 year long relationship over something as silly as a harmless little fetish! Swallowing the lump in his throat, Shuichi entered the room in which Kaede was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kaede...?\" He stammered, still a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Shu? Something the matter?\" She responded, looking over at him from her spot on the couch. She was dressed in a loose pair of sweats and an old t-shirt that had belonged to Shuichi until she had promptly claimed it as her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, nothing like that! I was just wondering if I could tell you about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about something? Of course, take a seat, babe!\" Kaede gave him a caring smile, patting the spot next to her. Shuichi came over to her, sitting down next to his girlfriend. Kaede rested her head softly on his shoulder, causing a light blush to pepper the young man's cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what'd you wanna talk to me about, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see... I've got, uhm... I've got a fetish that I want to run by you, if that makes any sense...\" Shuichi's light blush became a deep shade of crimson as he uttered that sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, no problem! Sooo, what're you into then~?\" Kaede winked at him, playfully giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see... I've noticed you're getting a bit... chubby, lately, and I figured that would be a good excuse to break it to you that I sort of have a thing for heavier women...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... And, correct me if I'm wrong, you want me to gain weight, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, that's the gist of it... If you wanna break up with me, I totally understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, break up with you? Shuichi, I'm not gonna break up with you! I'll gain as much weight as you want me to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... In that case, how about...\"</span></div></div>",
