It speeds towards the North American continent as it rapidly approaches the surface.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Patrick and Karen have no idea what is going on, since they're in suspended animation, so they notice nothing of the bumpy ride to the planet's surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the spacecraft crashes in a small lake with a mighty plunge before it glides across the water at high speed. After a few seconds, it slides over the water and stops on the shore of the lake, due to the force of the impact, where it remains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe internal computer system on board had detected that the environment was safe and that the ship has come to a rest. The passengers could now be taken out of their state of suspended animation. As soon as this happens, Patrick and Karen open their eyes and wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" Patrick asks the ship's computer. It replies that they have landed somewhere in North America. Then the computer shows them a list of words in English, French and Spanish. Since these kids are super intelligent, they pick up on these words right away and they learn how to speak these languages fluently in just a matter of hours before they can leave the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the door to the space craft opens for the first time, letting the fresh air in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two children are dressed in red and blue jumpsuits and black boots when they walk out and down the ramp of the ship for the first time, not knowing where they are...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We need to get some food and something to drink, and a place to stay would be nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick then saw a tree with some thick branches. He wondered if he could jump high enough, so he could grab hold of the branch. Maybe he could get a better view from standing on the branch. He leaped in the air, and he suddenly started flying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaaa! Karen! KAREN!\u201d he shouted, as he soared across the sky. \u201cI\u2019m flying!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPatrick! Whoa! I wonder if I can do that, too!\u201d Karen wondered out loud. \u201cIt looks like fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Karen jumped up with her arms extended and started flying through the air as well! It took her a few moments to control her direction, but she got the hang of it, just like her brother did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHOOHOOO!\u201d Patrick cheered, as he soared over the trees. \u201cFollow me, sis!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two flying kids then ascended over the forest until they suddenly saw the highway, which ran nearby. There were many cars and truck riding on it, at high speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at that street! Maybe we can ask someone on that busy street to give us directions!\u201d Karen suggested, as she flew next to her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I hope so\u2026\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kids continued to fly over the highway until they spotted a car, which was parked along the side of the road, on the curb. A lady had just gotten out, and she was examining her front tire, which had a flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook! Look at that lady over there! Maybe she can help us!\u201d Karen pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren and Patrick landed behind the car so that the lady didn\u2019t see the kids fly and land, since she was bent down and trying to unscrew the nuts from the screws, which held the tire in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, would you like some help?\u201d Patrick said to the lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady was middle aged, tall and skinny. She had long, brown hair and she was obviously very frustrated at the fact that she got a flat on the highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi\u2026 Oh, yes, I could use a hand\u2026\u201d she replied. \u201cBut, where did you two kids come from?\u201d she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we just got here. We flew\u2026\u201d Karen smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou flew? In an airplane?\u201d the lady asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! We came in our spaceship!\u201d Patrick replied. \u201cHow can we help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpace ship? Oh my!\u201d the lady said. \u201cWell, umm\u2026 I need a jack\u2026 I have no way to lift the front of my car so I can get the tire off\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me try!\u201d Patrick said, as he walked over to the front and placed his hand under her front bumper. Then he gently lifted up and raised the entire front of the car about two feet off the ground, like the vehicle was as light as a feather!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God\u2026\u201d the woman gasped, when she noted Patrick\u2019s incredible feat of strength. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can get your tire off, ma\u2019am!\u201d Karen said, as she walked over and quickly unscrewed all the bolts from the screws. Then she pulled the tire off, like it was a toy. \u201cHere, give me your spare!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy spare is in my trunk\u2026\u201d the lady said. She could almost not believe her eyes. Where did these super kids come from? How did they get so strong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren opened her trunk and pulled the spare out, carrying it with one hand. Then she placed the spare on the screws and tightened the bolts over the screws, holding it in place. Finally, she put the hubcap back on. Patrick gently set the car back on the ground again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go, ma\u2019am!\u201d Patrick cheered. \u201cAll done!\u201d he said, as he put the old tire in her trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m very impressed with you two kids! You did that like it was so easy for you! You two are so strong! How did you do that?\u201d the lady wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just came from Xavalia. Ever since we arrived here, we realized that we could fly and now we saw that we\u2019re really strong, too. I guess we have super powers on earth!\u201d Patrick explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Xavalia?\u201d the lady asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a planet, very far away\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am\u2026\u201d Karen asked. \u201cWe\u2019re kinda lost. Can you take us somewhere where we can eat and drink and find a place to stay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! My name is Julie, by the way! I\u2019m going to my church service. What are your names?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Patrick!\u201d the boy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Karen!\u201d Karen cheered, as she rubbed her hands on her blue suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, hop in; I\u2019ll get you something to eat!\u201d Julie said. \u201cBy the way, we\u2019re close to the beach! Welcome to California! Maybe we can go swimming later! I can hook you up with some of the other couples in my church\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids got in her car and they drove off, leaving the space ship behind in the woods.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As they were driving, Karen and Patrick remarked how beautiful the area seemed to them, and how eager they were to go to the beach sometime in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh look at that building!\u201d Karen pointed out; as they drove by a large warehouse. \u201cIt is stocked with lots of toys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToys?\u201d Julie asked. \u201cHow do you know? We can only see the walls from the outside!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if I concentrate hard enough, I see through them and then I see all the stuff inside of the building!\u201d Karen blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I see it too!\u201d Patrick remarked, as he peered out the window from the front seat of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing\u2026\u201d Julie said. \u201cYou kids are amazing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s called x-ray vision. We both have it. Don\u2019t all other people have it, too?\u201d Patrick asked Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Patrick. Most people on earth don\u2019t have x-ray vision\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut they can fly, right?\u201d Karen wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Julie smiled. \u201cEarthlings can\u2019t fly, either. Only you two can do that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow\u2026 We had better be careful, Karen!\u201d Patrick warned his sister. \u201cPeople will know we\u2019re different!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 No earthling is strong enough to lift a car, either\u2026\u201d Julie added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, your car wasn\u2019t heavy! It was as light as a feather!\u201d Patrick protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPatrick\u2026\u201d Julie laughed. \u201cCars are very heavy! You have super strength! Oh! Here the place!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie pulled into the parking lot of a MacDonald\u2019s and parked the car in a spot near the entrance. She turned off the engine and then opened the door. The two kids followed suit and jumped out, closing the doors behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threesome stood in line and ordered their food before they took their seats at one of the tables near the back of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick started eating his hamburger before he ate his fries, but Karen first ate her fries. When she finally got to her hamburger, it had gotten cold. She removed the bun and took the lettuce and the tomato off, exposing the beef patty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy burger is cold! I wish I could warm it up again\u2026\u201d she said, as she stared at it intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, two red beams of light shot from her eyes, striking the beef patty, heating it up instantly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness!\u201d Julie gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh cool!\u201d Patrick cheered. \u201cYou figured out how to use your heat vision! I need to test mine out as well!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick them grabbed one of his French fries and held it before him, setting it on fire with his own heat vision, before putting the burning fry in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYumm! Nice and crispy!\u201d he grinned, as he ate the burning fry while the flame was still burning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 That was amazing!\u201d Julie said, with her jaw open wide. \u201cYou two can start fires with your eyes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for lunch, Miss Julie!\u201d Patrick said politely. \u201cIt was delicious!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three walked out the door, Karen turned around and hugger Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really like you, Miss Julie!\u201d she said. \u201cPlease let us stay with you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let me take you to church and we\u2019ll take it from there, alright? I live with my son, and maybe you can live with me for awhile\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids got in her car and Julie started the engine before she pulled out of the parking lot and headed to the church where she had a meeting to attend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Patrick wore a black suit and Tie, and Karen wore a pure white dress that came down to her knees, both their shoes where black. Julie would never admit it but all of this was costing her a pretty penny. Julie parked right outside the church, she didn\u2019t get out of the car. What was she going to do? What was she going to say to everyone including her son and husband? All she could do was wing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk guys, we\u2019re here.\u201d Julie said turning around and looking at Patrick and Karen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Listen I need you two to do me a huge favor.\u201d Julie said with a small smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you need miss Julie?\u201d Patrick asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you both to not use your powers out in public.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie did not know how the kids would react but she need to get them to understand that being different is not always easy. The last thing she wanted was for everyone to be running out of a burning church. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Julie we have already decided to not use our power, in front of other people.\u201d Patrick said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Julie said with a little surprise in her voice <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie did not know this but Xavalians were able to do complex thinking at great speeds, this was further amplified with Patrick and Karen being empowered by earths yellow sun. Both Patrick and Karen already thought about what would happen if they exposed themselves, and lets just say 95 out of 100% it would probably end badly, and worse they feared that Julia would be in danger. So they already decided to keep their powers a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry miss Julie we won\u2019t let anyone find out about our powers.\u201d Karen said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk guys let\u2019s go to church.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie and the kids get out of the car and walk into the church. The church was called Salvation Core Church, and Julie had been going to this church ever since she was Karen\u2019s age. Upon walking into the church Julie notices that service had already started and whispered to both Patrick and Karen to be quiet. People where sitting down in their seats listening to the pastor Doug who stood in the front preaching the good word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk guys follow me I\u2019m taking you guys to  children\u2019s church.\u201d Julie whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick and Karen followed Julie throughout the church, and soon they came to a wooden door. On the door was a sign that read children\u2019s church in colorful letters. Karen used her x-ray vision to see through the door and she saw about 25 children who where all gathered together sitting down in a circle. She was a little nerves, she proved this by hiding behind her brother. Julie saw this and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou nerves Karen?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little. These are the first kids we\u2019ve been around, what if they don\u2019t like me.\u201d Karen said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry they will love you, and my kids in their as well so he\u2019ll look after you.\u201d Julie said patting Karen\u2019s head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be with you as well.\u201d Patrick said grabbing her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie opens the door and all three walk into the room filled with children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJulie its good to see you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA women with short blond hair and a black dress walks towards Julie and gives her a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you as well Lana, I\u2019m just dropping off my kids.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie puts both her hands on both Patrick\u2019s and Julie\u2019s back pushing them both forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana looked confuse, did she just say kids. Lana had known Julie for a long time, she had never seen these kids before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie saw Lana\u2019s skepticism and she was a little worried. Lana had a lot of questions but for now she had children to welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Guys welcome to children\u2019s church.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The boy had short brown hair, and small freckles that kind of reminded Patrick and Karen of Julie. The boy had light blue eyes, that seemed to shine like diamonds when the suns rays bounced off of them, which reminded Karen and Patrick of the Vrakros mountains that rested on their home-world of Xavalia, which were made of Diamonds and other rare shining minerals. The boy also looked to be a little older than Patrick and Karen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello my names Patrick and this is Karen.\u201d Patrick said with a. Smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Patrick and Karen, what were you doing with my mom.\u201d The boy said with a little bit of irritation in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick and Karen stared at the boy nonchalantly, they weren\u2019t surprise to find out that the boy was miss Julie\u2019s son, he looked exactly like her in more ways than one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Julie she has been taking care of us.\u201d Karen said with a big smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTaking care of you???!!!\u201d The boy yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s my mom, you guys just stay away from my mom you hear me or I\u2019ll beat you up.\u201d The boy grabs Patrick\u2019s collar and raises his fist in anger, threatening to punch Patrick in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick looked at the boy with surprise, but to his incredulity he did not feel afraid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Christopher Meadow Carter!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the students turn towards the door and see Lana and Julie with there hands on their hips. The boy in  particular had a worried look on his face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom?\u201d The boy says putting his fist down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou let Patrick down this instant.\u201d  Julie yelled walking towards the boy named Christopher , with authority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher quickly lets Patrick go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had never heard miss Julie so mad. Patrick didn\u2019t want Christopher to get into trouble but decided to stay out of it. Patrick looks over at his sister and sees that she is paying attention to the so called bible lesson and therefore didn\u2019t hear miss Julie talking to Christopher. Patrick didn\u2019t know what bible study was but it did sound entrusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick and Karen learned many things about the earth religion called Christianity. They learned about Moses, Noah, Abraham, and even Jesus Christ which they learned was a very important figure in human history.Patrick and Karen were no stranger when it came to religion, back on their home planet Xavalia they also had religion, and even when the Xavalians made more and more scientific advancement their belief in their so called religion did not decrease. And unlike earth which had a dozen religions, the Xavalians had only one. The Xavalians had a polytheistic religion, therefore they believed in more than one god, and at the very top of this pantheon was the great god Phiysus, the god of the dawn. Patrick and Karen didn\u2019t know what to make of this new god, but this god did seem nice and merciful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher soon comes in and joins the class. Everyone stares at him as we awkwardly walks in and sits down, far away from Patrick and Karen. Miss Julie had left to join the grown up church. Christopher would give both Patrick and Karen hateful looks that only Karen didn\u2019t notice. Patrick really wanted to get along with Christopher, but didn\u2019t know how to get on his good side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day advanced the children including Patrick, Karen, and Christopher participate in different activities like drawing, coloring, and board games that have something to do with biblical knowledge. Patrick was about to walk over to Christopher to talk when he heard something loud, and a dozen screams that seem to emanate from the next room <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Karen asks looking at her brother <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear that?\u201d Patrick asked looking at his sister a little startled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHear what?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaren, I have super hearing, you should have it to just Listen.\u201d Patrick said using his X-ray vision to see through the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk I\u2019ll try.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren closes her eyes and begins to focus on her ears. She listened and she heard everything. Sound from everywhere started to attack her ears, and in time overwhelm her. Karen grasps her ears and bends over in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick realizing that his sister is in pain, grabs her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaren you have to focus, block out all of thoughts sounds as focus on my voice.\u201d Patrick whispers into Karen\u2019s ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took awhile but soon Karen could control her hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you brother.\u201d Karen said letting out a breath of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem Karen, can you hear that?\u201d Patrick said returning his attention to the noise he heard a few minutes ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, what is that?\u201d Karen asks using her X-ray vision along with her brother to find out where that noise came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What do they see)</span></div></div>",

Karen using her X-ray Vision see\u2019s miss Julie, who looked terrified and had her arms around a bearded man that Karen didn\u2019t recognize. The men had leather masks on to hide their identities but those masks did little to hide their faces from Patrick and Karen\u2019s X-ray vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Julie needs help.\u201d Karen whispers to her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick looks at his sister to see that she had a worried look on her face. The truth was Patrick was worried as well, whoever these men where they truly meant to cause harm, but what could he and Karen do. They couldn\u2019t act, not without revealing who they really are, but if they don\u2019t act miss Julie could end up dead. Patrick was a smart boy, but he was still 8 years old, he was still a child, this whole situation truly scared him. Patrick looks over at Christopher and see Christopher looking at him and Karen with a suspicious look, which left Patrick a little confuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPatrick are you alright.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana walks over to Patrick, putting her hand on his shoulder. Lana saw Patrick looking scared as if he had seen a ghost, this worried her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBANG!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door bursts open and two masked gentlemen walk in with guns pointed at the ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I could have everyone\u2019s attention.\u201d One of the men said with a polite tone that masked his true intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana gets in front of the kids in order to protect them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Lana says with a shivering voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question miss, what I want is all of you to be quit, don\u2019t move, and I promise no one will get hurt. The man said holding his hands up in a playful manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do me a favor miss and get down.\u201d The man said with that same gentle voice but with a little more authority in his tone this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana bends down and gets on her knees, still staying in front of the children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dare you.\u201d Lana said with anger in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth men look at her as if she were crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the house of god, how dare you come here with guns threatening peoples lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men laughed, but Patrick could sense a little bit of pain in their laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod.... yes I once believed in that name, I once believed in this religion, but let me ask you miss.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked man steps closer to miss Lana, getting on his knees he points his weapon at Lana\u2019s head, with death in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is god Hm? Where is he when people need him, people are suffering and god is no where to be found. Do you know why that is?\u201d The man asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause their is no god.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked man had hatred in his voice, and his calm demeanor became more threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Julie\u2019s  perspective)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie didn\u2019t know what was going on but she was terrified. This day had gone from crazy to crazier. First she had found alien kids down the high way to church, the next she was being held hostage in a church of all places. She looked at her husband Marcus (Mark for short), and notices he was just as scared as she was. Julie couldn\u2019t help but think of the children Christopher, Patrick, and Karen. She couldn\u2019t help but wonder if they would see each other again. Julie has told Mark a little about both Patrick and Karen, and even though he was skeptical about adopting these kids, he was willing to give Julie a chance, but now he might never meet them. 5 masked men had barged their way into the church holding large guns, but soon two of the men went towards the direction of the children\u2019s church.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u201d Julie whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen men, we are so sorry to just barge in like this, but we just can\u2019t let this stand.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the masked men said with joy in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all offer praise to a god that doesn\u2019t care about you, you give your selfs to a god that uses you, well we say no more. To hell withreligion, to hell with anyone who worships such a god.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked man shouts. Whoever this man was Julie knew that he was insane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, please. Do not shed blood here in the house of god.\u201d The pastor says with a worried look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pastor steps closer to the armed men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do not know why you are doing this, but please let me help you, god will help you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pastor wears a hopeful smile on his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp me, god will help me?\u201d The man asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes of course god helps all of his children.\u201d The pastor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pastor puts his right hand on the masked mans shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust put the fun down.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked man starts to put his gun down, Julie along with almost everyone starts to feel hopeful, they might actually make it out of this alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod will help me you say? Then let me ask you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man steps forward and puts his gun to the pastors face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he help my daughter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBANG!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked man pulls the trigger and fires the gun right into the pastors face. The pastor falls to the ground dead. The masked man turns around and looks at the crowd of scared people still sitting in their chairs, and begins to take off his mask. The man had curly light brown hair and a small beard, a large scare surrounded his left eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you see what we are?! Do you see what your god has made us?!\u201d The man yells towards the heavens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are not his servants, we reject the light, we reject his plan. We...... we are the forsaken!<br>\r\n(Back with Patrick and Karen) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother what are we going to do?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Patrick and Karen had a accelerated thought process, so they could think a million times faster than a human being. Patrick at this moment was calculating the likelihood of everyone coming out alive, and he didn\u2019t like the results. Patrick and Karen had over heard the man, they recognized as the leader of all these masked men, in the other room say how they were the forsaken. Patrick and Karen also saw the man shoot the Pastor in the head with his weapon. Patrick seeing this covered his sisters eyes, trying to shield her from the horrific event, little did he realize she could see through his hands with her X-ray vision. Patrick knew that these masked men were out for blood, and if what the man said was true then the likelihood of everyone coming out of this alive was less than 10%. Patrick understood that the most dangerous man in the world, was a man that had nothing to lose, these men fit that description. Patrick glanced over at Christopher, and saw how he looked scared along with all the children in the room. Patrick owed miss Julie a debt, for taking care of him and his sister, and trusting them with all of her heart, Patricks father had always told him to always pay back his debts, and right now Patrick intended to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Karen, we have to act.\u201d Patrick said, whispering to his little sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Karen asked looking at her big brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick looked around his surroundings and saw a black ski hat on the floor. Patrick slowly grabbing the ski hat used his heat vision to carve three holes into it without anyone noticing, making it a black ski mask, that robbers wear (Patrick doesn\u2019t know this of course).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Karen I\u2019m going to take down the bad men using this as a disguise.\u201d Patrick said showing Karen the ski mask he created. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk what am I going to do?\u201d Karen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou... uh... you?\u201d Patrick was a little lost for words, in truth Patrick didn\u2019t want Karen to do anything. This could be dangerous, and Patrick didn\u2019t want his little sister getting hurt, but if. Karen was one thing she was stubborn, she was to much of a good person to stand around and do nothing while people were getting hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou... your job is to protect everyone from the fight, make sure no one gets hurt, or caught up in the battle, ok?\u201d Patrick asked, looking for approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d Karen says with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick hiding behind a few of the children puts on the ski mask, and gets ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to move as fast as I can.\u201d Patrick thinks, concentrating on moving fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick staying low gets on his feet, but before he starts to move he realizes something. His surroundings, the other kids, miss Lana, Christopher, Karen, and even the armed men were all moving very slow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Patrick asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick stand up, and realizes that his body is being attacked by a lot of force, kinetic energy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime hasn\u2019t slowed down, no I\u2019m just moving very fast.\u201d Patrick says, thinking his currant situation through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I did want to movie fast.\u201d Patrick said giggling to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick looks at his sister and realizes that she is moving faster than everyone else, but not as fast as him. Patrick soon realized that Karen unlike everyone else was able to see him even when he was moving at such a remarkable speed, but the only problem was that Karen was still in real time. Patrick knew that Karen had the power to move at the same speeds but right now he didn\u2019t have time to teach her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looking at Patrick, saw her brother as a blur. Karen soon realized that her brother was moving very fast, so fast that no one could see him move, other then her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to move that fast as well.\u201d Karen thought Concentrating on her speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren after concentrating for a few seconds soon realized that her surrounding had slowed down. She had done it, she was moving as fast as her brother. Karen looked towards the direction of her brother with a smile on her face, but realized that he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick had started to attack the armed masked men, not realizing that his sister had activated her super speed as well. Patrick didn\u2019t want to stay in one place for to long. Patrick in truth didn\u2019t know how fast he was moving, and therefore wanted to eliminate any chance of someone seeing him. Patrick zigzagged towards the armed masked men. When he got to the first masked man, Patrick gently pushes the man with one hand. Patrick remembered how miss Julie had said to both him and Karen, how humans do not have super strength, Patrick knew he had to hold back, the only problem was that he didn\u2019t know how much he had to hold back. The man that Patrick pushed goes flying through the wall, with three broken ribs (unknown to Patrick). Patrick not resting, or slowing down run towards the second arm men, who started firing his weapon in surprise. Patrick sees small metal objects come out of the weapon and head towards the crowd, Patrick didn\u2019t know what this material was but he knew that it was destructive (they were bullets). Patrick soon notices were one of the bullets were headed. \u201cChristopher!\u201d Patrick yells running after the bullet, trying to reach Christopher, or at least get in the way of the bullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick running after the bullet sees something in the corner of his right eye. Patrick Turning his head sees his sister Karen jump in front of the bullet shielding Christopher from harm. Patrick didn\u2019t know why he was surprised, it was his idea to tell his sister to protect everyone, but he said that to keep his sister away from harm. Patrick knew that this metal moving at this speed was deadly to anyone, Patrick thought back to when he saw the pastor get hit by this metal, how the pastor died from the impact, Patrick would never be able to live himself if his sister died because of his stupidity. Patrick pushed himself forward, literally willing himself to go faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaren move out of the way!\u201d Patrick yelled at his sister, but no she stood firm, determined to protect Christopher, even if it costed her, her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren with her eyes closed, no longer concentrated on her speed therefore reverted back to normal time. Everyone was shocked to see Karen standing in front of Christopher, not sure as to how she got their when she was a few feet away from Christopher before, but their shock soon turned to fear as the armed masked man continued to fire his gun. Karen feels the bullet hit her chest, but to her surprise she feels nothing but a light tap and the loud sound of compressed metal. Karen opens her eyes and looks towards her dress to see a small bullet hole shaped mark on the dress that miss Julie had bought for her, but no blood, no injury. She was not hurt at all. Karen was invulnerable to the enemy\u2019s attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh cool.\u201d Karen said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher seeing Karen standing up grabs her arm and pulls her down to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Christopher asks looking at Karen with angry eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay down!\u201d Christopher demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick still using his super speed sees  that Karen was unhurt from the mans bullets. Patrick was no longer worried for his little sisters safety, but that didn\u2019t mean he could rest, his sister was invulnerable, not everyone else. Patrick moving as fast as he could prevents the other bullets from touching anybody else, and with quick hast runs towards the masked guns men. Patrick rips the gun form the masked mans hands and grabs the mans jacket with both of his hands. Patrick with great ease throws the masked Man out of a glass window, that led outside the church. Patrick wasn\u2019t worried that he killed the man, they were on ground level after all so the man didn\u2019t fall far at all. The man was  knocked out on impact with the ground, with a broken arm and a small concussion to the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick could breath a little easy now, but deep down he knew that his work was not finished. Patrick looks over towards his sister, who was sitting with Christopher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go help miss Julie, you stay hear and protect everybody.\u201d Patrick says still using his super speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally no human being would be able to understand Patrick\u2019s words, with him talking so fast, Karen on the other hand could understand Patrick just fine, and lightly nods her head as she sees Patrick super speed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis ends now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She along with everyone else in room saw their beloved Pastor get shot in the head. Miss Julie had known Pastor Doug, or as everyone else would call him Father Doug, her whole life. As the name would suggest, father Doug was a father figure to everyone, for better or for worse as soon as you became a member of the church you became his son/daughter, you became family. Miss Julie along with everyone else knew that the last thing that a kind and holy man deserved was to be shot in the head, especially if that man was father Doug. Miss Julie on the verge of tears hugs her husband, reverting her gaze from the horrific sight that was father Doug\u2019s lifeless corpse. She wasn\u2019t the only one everyone in the church had tears flowing from their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no don\u2019t revert your gaze, do not turn away from the truth!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Julie screams as she is forcibly yanked away from her beloved husband by the leader of the masked men armed with guns. The man wore no mask, his face was shown to all, the man had curly brown hair that looked like it had not been combed in weeks, and small messy beard, and over his left eye was a deep jagged scare. Miss Julie knew that this man was the leader of this horrible gang, and  she also knew that the fact that this man allowed everyone to see his face probably meant that this man had no intention of letting any of them live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at him.\u201d The man demanded as he forcibly held Miss Julie\u2019s left arm, as they both stood before father Doug\u2019s dead body. Miss Julie didn\u2019t want to look, she continued to revert her gaze from the horrific sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at him! Look at what your god has allowed!\u201d The man yells pointing his gun at Miss Julie\u2019s head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie turns her gaze to her husband Mark who tried to come to her rescue but was quickly restrained by two of the masked men, who both pointed their guns at his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at him.\u201d The man says again more quietly, but with more intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie for a moment looks at the man who was grabbing her arm, she looks him right in his light blue eyes that were cold and devoid of any emotion. Julie soon reverts her eyes to father Doug, tears started run down her cheeks. Julie seeing her friend dead felt sadness, but also anger. Julie\u2019s gaze returns to the man, the man who had taken her friend away <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is your fault.\u201d Julie says in a shaky voice, a voice not shaky because of fear, but because of her sadness and anger mixed together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo this is your gods fault, not mine.\u201d The man says looking at Julie with anger in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Julie yells <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeople are  dying around you, This is your fault and you know it!\u201d Julie yells, and with a her might slaps the man in the face with her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hall goes quite, everyone including the masked men where to shocked to even move. Julie and the man look at each other, Julie with anger, and the man with shock. The mans shock soon turns to a evil smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBehold your bravest.\u201d The man says finally letting Julie go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow behold her death.\u201d The man says pointing his gun at Julie, ready to pull the trigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBANG, BANG, BANG.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie closes her eyes as The sound of gun fire echoes throughout the building. Julie soon realizes that she felt no pain, and soon opens her eyes to look at the man with his gun pointed at her. She soon realizes that the gunfire didn\u2019t come from this man, or from any of the masked men in the room, Julie soon remembered that their where 5 masked men. Two of the men went in the direction of the children\u2019s church. Julie soon grew worried for her children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man puts his gun down and pulls out a  walkie-talkie from his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDango, come in what\u2019s happening.\u201d The man asks. Julie knew that he was using a code name when addressing his Ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir was nothing but static on the other line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in Dango, what\u2019s happening.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grew concerned, what could have happened. Julie had a idea, of what had happened but she wasn\u2019t sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning something bursts in from the right hand window, something fast and strong that appeared as nothing but a blur in people\u2019s eyes. Before anyone could get a good look at the moving object, the object jumps out of the other left hand window taking one of the masked men with him. Everyone could hears the masked man screams as he was pulled out of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?! Where\u2019d he go!\u201d The man says terrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie wore a little smile on her face, their was only two people who could move that fast \ud83d\udca8. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fast moving object appears again throwing another masked man through a window, and then disappearing without a trace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?!\u201d The man says with sweat falling from his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, maybe this is the work of god.\u201d Julie says with a smile as she looks at the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looks at Julie with anger in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry dude, but it looks like it is judgment day.\u201d Julie says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDie bitch!\u201d The man yells pointing his gun at Julie and pulling the trigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Patrick 3rd person) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick moving as fast as he could pulls two masked men outside of the beautiful church windows, but he saw using his x ray vision that the leader was starting to panic. He knew that he had to end this fast. Patrick hovers above the church, using his X-ray vision to spy on the last man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick soon sees the man fire his gun at Julie. Patrick could see the metal material speed it\u2019s way towards Miss Julie\u2019s head. Patrick races towards the bullet. Patrick  knew that his sister was bullet proof, so he should be to. It only took a few minutes for Patrick to grab the bullet, which totally surprised Patrick, he could really move very fast. Patrick\u2019s without waiting anymore time picks up the man and flys I<br>\r\nHim out of the church at super speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick with great care knocked out all of the men and left all of them on the front lawn of the church, and secretly made his way back to the children\u2019s church before anyone noticed that he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Julie 3rd person) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe all of the men where gone in seconds. No one knew what had happened, no one other than Julie. Julie looks at her husband, who was looking at her in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, have you ever thought of adoption?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Patrick makes sure to blend in to the crowd of children as Miss Lana comforts the kids, and makes sure that the armed masked man, Patrick sent flying through the wall was completely knocked out. Patrick seeing Karen by Christopher walks towards her with a smile on his face. Karen seeing Patrick runs towards him and gives him a massive bear huge, that would have completely crushed any normal person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank the almighty Phiysus you are ok.\u201d Karen says with tears in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick and Karen remain silent for a few minutes as they hold each other in a warm embrace, after a few seconds Karen breaks the hug and looks at Patrick with a series expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs Miss Julie ok, And of course everyone else?\u201d Karen quickly asks, looking at her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, sister everyone is fine, the bad guys have been taken care of.\u201d Patrick says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d Karen says taking a breath of fresh air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Patrick and Karen talk with one another, Christopher walks over to them, looking angry \ud83d\ude21. Patrick soon sees Christopher walking towards both him and Karen, and he couldn\u2019t help but get a bad feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk you guys have a lot of explaining to do.\u201d Christopher says pointing his finger at Patrick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Patrick asks, looking at Christopher a little surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys have been acting strange ever since I\u2019ve met you.\u201d Christopher says getting even more angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat how?\u201d Karen asks, getting a little mad \ud83d\ude20. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick looks at Karen and Christopher as they both stare at each other with dagger like eyes, and quite frankly he was a little nervous. Christopher and Karen didn\u2019t seem to get a long with one another very well. Patrick Knew his sister and the one thing she had was a temper, her stubbornness only added to that fact. Patrick knew that his sister would never hurt anyone, but when it came to anger, and these new powers they both had to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow? You are really asking me how?\u201d Christopher asks sarcastically, as he stares at Karen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell their was the time you were grasping your ears like you where hearing something very loud, also the time when you both were staring at the wall, and I don\u2019t know \ud83e\udd14, maybe the time when you where standing up in front of gunfire.\u201d Christopher says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick hits his head with his right palm. Apparently someone had noticed both him and Karen when they where using their powers, Christopher. They must have looked so stupid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Christopher.....\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to explain our selfs to you!\u201d Karen yells cutting Patrick off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick and Christopher where taken back from Karen\u2019s little outburst. Karen was a strong willed girl, and Patrick knew that, that strong will, was going to be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaren calm down.\u201d Patrick says looking at his sister with a little worried look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I, he\u2019s being mean.\u201d Karen says glaring at Christopher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said calm down.\u201d Patrick says with a cold tone that shook Karen and Christopher to her core.\ud83d\udc7a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren lived by three rules that she learned over time, one honer and love the gods with all of her heart, two Liston to her parents, and three never make her brother angry. If their was one thing you didn\u2019t want to do was make her brother angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d Karen says looking at her brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks Christopher I know you have a lot of questions.\u201d Patrick says,  returning to his normal friendly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you are going to have to be patient.\u201d Patrick says grabbing Christopher\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher looks into Patrick\u2019s eyes for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea whatever.\u201d Christopher says walking away from Patrick and Karen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day passed with great hast. The police\ud83d\udc6e Had arrive in a matter of minutes, and the 5 armed men where all arrested, without much trouble. Patrick, Karen and Christopher where reunited with Julie and Patrick and Karen got to meet Julie\u2019s husband Mark Grayson. Everyone was currently outside of the church talking with one another. Lana had already left for home, as soon as she said good bye to Julie, and not many people where left at the church. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo these are the kids you where talking about?\u201d Patrick asks with a little smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep these are the kids.\u201d Julie says wrapping Karen and Patrick around her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick wondered how much miss Julie had told Mr mark about him and Karen, but by Marks behavior Patrick came to the conclusion that Julie didn\u2019t tell Mark about Karen and his origins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you Mr. Mark.\u201d Patrick says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you to Patrick.\u201d Mark says holding out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick stares at Patrick\u2019s hand for a little while, Patrick never ever heard of a handshake \ud83e\udd1d so he was quite confused. Mark confused takes Patrick\u2019s hand and shakes it. Patrick soon relived that this was a form of greeting between earthlings, and was amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you to Karen.\u201d Mark soon reaches his hand towards Karen expecting another hand shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren, having come to the same conclusion as he brother grabs marks hand and shakes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for taking us in.\u201d Karen says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTaking them in?\u201d Christopher asks feeling a little confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Julie look at each other, and they soon shift their gaze to their son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChristopher buddy, me and your mom are thinking about adopting both Patrick and Karen.\u201d Mark says getting down on his knees to look at his son Julie right behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristopher could believe this it was like his whole world was falling apart. He didn\u2019t like Patrick, and he absolutely hated Karen, now, now he might have to spend the rest of his life with them, oh hell no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair!\u201d Christopher yells running to Marks white Toyota truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick, Karen, Mark, Julie watch as Christopher runs to the truck. Karen couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for Christopher, maybe this was a bad idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie tells Patrick and Karen to wait by her car while Julie talks to Mark. Patrick could tell that Julie was going to tell Mark their secret, and he thought it was the right thing to do. The conversation lasted for a few minutes, and Patrick and Karen hears Julie call them over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick and Karen looking at Mark sees that he is a little bit hesitant. Julie had really did it, she. Had really told Mark the big secret, but both Patrick and Karen could tell that Mark didn\u2019t really believe it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Patrick, Karen could you guys Show Mark one of your many gifts.\u201d Julie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick and Karen look at Julie for a few seconds and soon look at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaren follow my lead.\u201d Patrick says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren nods her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick could tell that their was still a lot of people around so they could put do anything to flashy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick closes his eyes, and Karen realizing what her brother was doing closes her eyes as well. Patrick and Karen open their eyes, and Mark could barley stand up after witnessing what he saw. Both Patrick and Karen\u2019s eyes where glowing red from their heat vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man it looks like I have Alien children.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They would soon discover that Earth's yellow sun would cause the Xavalian children to possess superhuman strength, speed, and other incredible powers as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese children are soon discovered by a loving couple and raised by them. They use their powers for good. They may decide to become super heroes, or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two children are a boy and a girl: Patrick, who is 8 years old, and Karen, who is 6 years old. After they land and emerge from the ship, they discover that they have super strength, they're invulnerable, they have super speed, and they can fly. They also have all the super senses, like super hearing, x-ray vision, heat vision, and super breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids are completely omnipotent on earth and have no weaknesses at all. Luckily, they aren't evil. On the contrary, they're shy, timid and curious and very helpful. They are willing to help anyone they meet, and who is willing to help them for they are homeless and have no place to stay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease: No killing, no sex, and no foil language permitted.
