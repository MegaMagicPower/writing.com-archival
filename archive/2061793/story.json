            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All right let's start with fairy tail best know female mages. It the only way to start of course and remember if you don't know what the girl looks like new tab and google are your go to place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1st Choice: Lucy Hearfilla, most fans will call her either the blonde bombshell of the guild or the cry baby that just won't stop crying over every little thing. Still here's what you need to know about Lucy Heartfilla. She has brown eyes and shoulder length blonde hair that is usually tied by ribbons in a variety of colours in a small ponytail to the right side of her head with the rest of the hair loose. However, in the year X791 she appears to keep her hair up more often in pigtails. She is buxom, and has a curvaceous body. Her (presumed) measurements are: bust, 91 cm; waist, 59 cm; and hip, 88 cm (36 in, 24 in, 35 in)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2nd Choice: Erza Scarlet. The female badass of the guild this sword wielding women has down more foes then I have drank tea (And that's a lot) So lets see what you need to know about this powerful women. a young woman with long, scarlet hair and brown eyes. She lost her right eye as a child and now has an artificial one which was created by Porlyusica. She has a slender, voluptuous figure that Lucy Heartfilia described as \"amazing.\" Her most common attire consists of a custom-made armor by Heart Kreuz smiths, a blue skirt, and black boots. Her Fairy Tail stamp is blue and is located on the middle of her left upper arm. Erza's specialty in Requip Magic allows her to requip not only armors but different outfits as well, enabling her to change her attire at any given time. Erza is a very strict person, often criticizing the bad behaviour and habits of the other guild members, causing most of them to apologize, fearing that they might invoke her wrath.[11] She is also very impatient, disliking people who don't answer her questions quickly enough. This, coupled with her own tragic childhood, caused many of her guild mates to avoid her due to her social awkwardness. However, she has a great sense of justice and pride in being a member of Fairy Tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3rd Choice: Mirajane Strauss. The demon women if you know what I mean. Still let's see what you need to know. Mirajane is a slim young woman of below average height. She has long, white hair which curls slightly at the ends, with two bangs framing her face and reaching down to her chest; her hairstyle's most distinctive trait is a short, upward ponytail obtained by gathering and tying the hair covering her forehead. Due to her always adopting such fashion, her hair seems to have adapted to it, with the hair on her forehead remaining pointed upwards even when not tied. She has large blue eyes and a curvy, voluptuous body, with large breasts. Her white Fairy Tail Stamp is located on her left thigh. Mirajane is widely known for her beauty, being Fairy Tail\u2019s drawing card and having posed many times for the Sorcerer Magazine. Mirajane\u2019s most commonly seen attire is a sleeveless, ankle-length maroon dress with a pleated skirt. The chest is adorned by a large, pink bow, and similarly coloured trimmings frame the rather ample neckline, acting as straps, and circle around the waist. Mirajane also wears high-heeled shoes that match her dress, and accessorizes with a small chain necklace with a blue oval gem attached to it, and a bracelet made of white flowers circling her right wrist. She is a loving and caring person who treats her friends, and even strangers, with kindness. Mirajane plays a motherly role within the guild, and is often seen running the bar at the guild hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4th Choice: Levy McGarden. The book worm of the guild and yet quiet popular with fans. Let see what you need to know. Levy is a rather young, petite teenage girl of a slender build who stands at a rather below-average height for her age. Her shoulder-length blue hair, which has eyebrow-length bangs, is normally tied up with a colourful bandana around her head. While initially portrayed as having rather straight hair, her hair has slowly gained a more wavy, wild look, with more locks hanging down the sides of her face. Levy has a variety of outfits, but her most preferred type of attire appears to be dresses and tank tops, both of which reveal the guild mark on her left scapula.When performing tasks such as researching, she wears a pair of Gale-Force Reading Glasses and tends to tie up her hair to keep it out of her face. Levy has a cheerful and upbeat personality, and as such she is, rather easily, able to get along quite well with her guild mates. Her kind spirit is shown through her reluctance to get involved in the many brawls the guild has together, as she is too nice to fight \"just for fun.\" She is also a very forgiving person, as she reconciled with Gajeel Redfox for torturing her and her teammates before the start of the Fairy Tail-Phantom Lord war, and later allowed him to become her partner for the S-Class Promotion Trial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5th Choice: More choices. That's right we going through the fairy tail guild first. So more fairy tail ladies coming up. (Cana, Evergreen and Lisanna. etc.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A magic which I am going to leave the reader to decide how power it is but like any author allow me throw a suggest into this piece.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jake was completely broke and desperate. Worst of all, everything should have gone according to plan. He could join a guild, use his magic to go on quests, and earn himself tons of money. Simple, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, not exactly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd arrived in this town after spending his money on transport and food, leaving him with only a few savings. Hence he joined the fist guild he came across. But this proved to be a mistake, as the guild required him to pay an entrance's fee. Then it became clear after a while that the guild was a scam all along; thieves who'd made him think they were a mage guild. And he fell for their scheme like an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed by, Jake tried to get a plain job to earn himself some money, but no one wanted him. Granted, his skill set wasn't really extraordinary. Jake could be booksmart, but physical activity was... not his best point, to say the least. He was of average height, and rather plain, plus he was a bit on the skinny side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man slammed a hand on the table, barely drawing any stares from the other patrons. The tavern wasn't really stacked this hour of day. It was already getting late, and he could be considered lucky to at least have lodgings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should use my magic to get what I want. Damn ethics are just holding me back, while others laugh at my misery.\" Jake grumbled morosely to himself, taking another sip of his drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jake considered himself booksmart, he didn't exaggerate. He'd managed to learn a rare magic art; mind control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many variations of mind control, such as hypnosis or making someone see illusions. Jake's magic was better though. By simply looking into a person's eyes, using his mesmeric gaze, he could put them under a trance and completely rewrite their mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErasing or editing a person's memories? Piece of cake. Changing a person's personality? It would take only a minute. He could even implant certain triggers, which would cause the victim to react as previously instructed. Jake knew his magical abilities were impressive, and worthy of respect! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus he grew increasingly furious with his current predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sighed. \"Sooner or later my funds will run out. Going to need a solution; fast.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell chimed softly as someone entered the tavern. Having nothing better to do, Jake looked over to see who the newcomer was. He blinked several times to see if he was dreaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a girl. A beautiful, blonde-haired girl with the body of a fertility goddess. She couldn't be any older than twenty with that youthful appearance. Her long, golden hair was styled into two ponytails. The beauty wore quite the outfit; a tight blue vest, a short white skirt, and black tights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what really had him panting like a dog was her enormous bust. He'd never seen such tits before! Well, in porn magazines maybe, but still. The girl's breasts were massive, resembling cantaloupes glued to her chest. They bounced and wriggled in the confines of her vest. Her ass was big too, and those hips were nothing short of childbearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake couldn't hear what she was saying to the bartender, but he seemed to nod and accept the money she gave him. However, he did notice the set of keys on her belt. They were easily recognizable; celestial spirit keys. Only a celestial mage used those, summoning powerful spirits for help, and judging by the numerous golden keys, this was a powerful one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes drifted to her hand, finally identifying her guild mark as that of Fairy Tail. Now, this explained a few things. It made sense that such an accomplished mage -- jealousy surged like a nasty monster within Jake -- would be part of said mage guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, the mark explained why she was so beautiful. Even he had heard the rumors of Fairy Tail's female mage population. They were supposed to be some of the most gorgeous, sexiest and voluptuous girls in the business. And this girl <i>definitely </i>belonged to its top tier members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, so lucky...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA guy like him would never have a chance with a girl like that. She had a guild, comrades, a source of income and was beautiful. It was everything one could desire. He certainly did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, maybe he could get what he wished for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde mage left the bar, heading upstairs to her recently rented room. Jake's eyes never left her. It wasn't until she disappeared that he chugged down the rest of his beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, he had played by the rules. He never stole, cheated or used his powers on anyone for his own gain. But where did that get him? The answer; nowhere. It was about time he took some initiative! Screw being the good guy! If people thought he was just going to sit there, drown all of his sorrows and stay a loser with morals, then they were in for a big surprise! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake put down the empty mug, and followed the girl. He had his own room, so the bartender didn't even bat an eye as he left so shortly after the female mage. And Jake would take advantage of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, all guest rooms were on the same floor. He easily found out which room she'd taken, and after checking the coast was clear, he made his way over. Jake steeled his nerves as he knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming!\" A pretty voice answered him. Seconds later the door was open, allowing him to properly see the gorgeous mage. \"Can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, as a matter of fact you can. My name's Jake Rose.\" The young man greeted her like a friend. \"It's a pleasure to meet you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled kindly. \"Lucy Heartfilia. Nice to meet you too. So, do you need help or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll help me out all aright.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could react, Jake activated his magical ability. His eyes began to glow an ominous red, which was quickly mirrored by Lucy's eyes; the white of her eyes now equally glowing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer entire body went slack as if she spontaneously relaxed. There was no longer an intelligent look in her eyes. They were dulled, just like her senses. Jake grinned, happy to see his abilities hadn't dulled at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you hear me, Lucy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" She spoke softly, devoid of any emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will allow me to come into your room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy nodded numbly, and stepped aside. He leered lecherously at her huge tits, which were still hidden in that tight vest of hers. Still, he controlled himself for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door was locked, he chuckled at the sight of Lucy; still in a trance. Now he just needed to decide on what to do with her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time for our next choices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1st Choice: Cana Alberona. The women who could drink anyone under the table let see what you need to know about her. Cana is a tall, slim, young woman with an ample bust and tan skin. She has long, mid-back length brown hair with varying shades of colour, having been seen as bright brown,black, and, ultimately, plain brown. Two shoulder-length strands of hair frame her face, with the left one starting from a prominent, high fringe. Her hair is curlier in the manga than in the anime, in which it appears more thick and wavy. After the S-Class Trial, Cana was momentarily shown with her hair tied in a high ponytail.Cana has large brown eyes and visibly long eyelashes; Cana's face is noticeably sharper in the manga compared to her appearance in the anime.She possesses a very voluptuous figure, with large breasts and curvy hips, which, over time, steadily become more defined. Her black Fairy Tail stamp is located on the lower left part of her abdomen, right above her hips. Cana's fingernails, while usually shown to be cut back and uncoloured are sometimes kept long and adorned by nail polish of different colours.Cana's shapely upper body is usually left largely exposed, with most of her attires being distinctively scanty: her standard outfit consists of a light blue bikini top which features a camouflage pattern, a pair of capri pants, with two bands hanging from each leg and a light belt covered in heart motifs loosely tied around the waist. She completes her general outfit by wearing a pair of high-heeled sandals. She also had a pair of metal bracelets adorning her biceps, bearing an incision composed of many \"A\"s, and three simple, round metal bracelets on her right wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana has a great love for alcoholic beverages such that it borders on addiction. Oftentimes, she is often seen drinking directly from a large beer barrel.She started drinking at the age of thirteen, two years before the legal age, and the frequency of her drinking has grown to the point where thirty percent of Fairy Tail's liquor budget goes down her throat. Despite her drinking and somewhat laid-back attitude, Cana is one of the more serious members of the guild: she hardly ever goofs off (except when she's drinking), unlike the majority of the other members.She is very focused on the situation at hand. In the guild itself, Cana often assumes leadership in dire situations, such as during the fight against Phantom Lord, and assesses situations in a logical manner. She is extremely loyal to the guild and its members, regardless of how new they are or what their background may be.In addition, Cana always stands up for her dreams (to become an S-Class Mage) and is rather tenacious, as shown when she attacked Freed, despite being unable to defeat him in the past, without hesitation during their S-Class Mage Promotion Trial battle. However, the S-Class exam showed another side of her. She demonstrated a very selfish side, one which was willing to betray her teammates to become an S-Class Mage. This goal and selfishness of hers caused her to even put her own guildmates in peril. This desperation actually stemmed from her desire to confess to her father. However, upon realizing her mistake she became deeply depressed and tried to rectify her mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2nd choice: Evergreen. The stone women that's all I have to say. Lets see what you need to know about her. Evergreen has light brown hair, dark brown eyes and visible pink lips. She wears oval glasses and has a very voluptuous figure paired with very large breasts and curvy hips. When she first appeared, her hair was arranged in a sidewards ponytail and she wore a gray dress (green in the anime) that had movable wings on the back of it. She wore navy blue stockings along with white sandals, and carried around a feathered purple fan with three hearts on it.Her green guild stamp is located on the right side of her bosom. Evergreen is a woman who loves fairies, and her childhood dream was to become one. She greatly admires beauty and elegance. When first introduced, she came off as a vain and arrogant woman who had no problem with turning the people that were supposed to be her guild mates into statues, all for the sake of Laxus. She battled and revealed her longtime resentment of Erza Scarlet, all for harbouring the name Titania and not even particularly caring for the title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvergreen is shown to care very, very deeply for Laxus and her teammates, and she appears quite fond of them, and they of her. She said once that they'd been together for \"a long time.\" As such, they were initially the only people with whom she interacted. After Laxus' exile, she and her teammates began to open up to the guild more and more, and she's seen around the guild hall on numerous occasions. While quite vain and prideful, she is not without regret, as seen when she and Elfman were defeated, and she tearfully apologized to him, blaming the entire ordeal on herself.Her caring side towards others has been shown, as exampled when the 8-Island Restaurant was attacked and she constantly called out for Yajima, and began to cry when she realized she was helpless to rescue him from his apparent demise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3rd Choice: More.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Here we go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBisca Connell: The shooting female of the guild. Here's what you need to know for this cow girl. Bisca is a young woman with long, straight green hair that reaches down to her lower back, and a set of long bangs framing her face. She has brownish purple eyes, large breasts, and is always seen wearing red lipstick. After the time skip, Bisca seems to have gained sharper facial features, and has developed a curvier physique. The lower section of her hair is now tied into a thick braid.Bisca's attire mirrored that of a fictional cowgirl, with a Western-style hat always visible on her head, a light, polka-dotted neck scarf, and a pair of reddish brown boots. Her body was covered by a short, strapless one-piece dress decorated by spiraling motifs (portrayed as plain blue in the anime) with darker, striped edges (portrayed as plain white in the anime). Bisca is a determined girl who loves Fairy Tail and is willing to fight for the good of her comrades. She is very loyal to her guild and will stand up to fight for them, even if she is unable to prevail. She demonstrates a headstrong personality when facing most of her fellow guildmates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisanna Strauss: The demon lady little sister. Boy family huh. Still let's see what you'll need to know about her. She wears a light-blue striped shirt, with green short-shorts and sneakers. Her member stamp was originally red and was located on her left arm just below the shoulder,however, as she was being sucked into the Anima, her member stamp disappeared. In Edolas, she changed her stamp to white and it is now located on her left thigh. When Lisanna was younger, she was very kind like Elfman was as a child. She wanted to help Natsu Dragneel raise an unknown egg to see what comes out of it, being a little more knowledgeable than Natsu. After seeing a softer side of the usually flamboyant Natsu, she stated that he was a lot like her sister and joked that perhaps later she should become his bride/wife which predictably freaked him out.  Whilst raising the egg with him, he learned it was \"impossible\" to win in an argument with her.] Lisanna apparently likes animals (especially cats) but she hates studying. Because of her personality, she can easily adjust and be accepted by anyone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3rd Choice: Finally the last two fairy tail girls ( Juvia and Laki) </span></div></div>",

Lets see what you need to know about her. Laki is a slim young woman of average height with straight, pale lavender hair set in a bowl cut-like style, with her fringe covering the left part of her forehead, and the right side exposed. She has also been seen sporting longer hair in other instances, with two bangs framing her face and her forehead being covered by her fringe. She has brown eyes, and a large, dark-colored ribbon adorning the top of her head. She is always shown wearing a pair of simple glasses with oval lenses. After the 7-year time skip, the only noticeable changes in her appearance are the hair, whose style is reminiscent of her previous long cut, but wavier, with the bangs framing her face and going down to her shoulders being undulated, with a triangular tuft covering her forehead, and larger breasts. Her ribbon now marks the spot where Laki\u2019s hair is tied in a long ponytail, reaching down to the middle of her back. As of the year X791, Laki sports a red mantle, held closed on the front by a ring, over a strapless, dark dress, with a revealing neckline and a series of light-coloured squares adorning its lower part, which has a light belt circling it around Laki\u2019s waist, with three bullet-like objects attached to it on the left side, and dark boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaki likes glasses and wears them as well, and she has a strong dislike towards perverts. Laki also expresses herself in strange ways, for example, she refers to getting a haircut as \"chopping hair\", eating as \"feeding your stomach\", and sleeping as \"whittling away the defenseless hours. She seems to have a slightly sadistic side, as she keeps a large amount of torture devices in her room in Fairy Hills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Choice: Juvia Lockstar the final choice before we move on to other guilds. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Here she is the final choice for the fairy tail guild section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1st Choice: Juvia Lockstar, The water women. Let see what you need to know. Juvia is a slender, young woman with blue hair, dark blue eyes, pale skin and a curvaceous figure. Juvia is first introduced with long hair, tightly curled at the base, wearing a navy blue coat, a fur shawl with a teru teru b\u014dzu attached to it, as well as a Russian Cossack hat. Upon becoming a member of Fairy Tail, she cut her long hair and began to wear more revealing clothing. However, after hearing about Gray Surge's crush on her Edolas counterpart, Juvia reverts to her original appearance, with the exception of the teru teru b\u014dzu, instead wearing a Fairy Tail emblem. Juvia's Fairy Tail Guild Stamp is above her left thigh,being blue in color. Her Guild Stamp color later changed to white in X792. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the time of the Grand Magic Games, Juvia starts wearing a knee-high dark dress coat which is adorned with four, symmetrically placed, light-coloured buttons on the chest. The coat is garnished with fur trimmings around her sleeve cuffs and neck. Juvia wears a matching, dark, Russian-style hat, stylized with a light-colored butterfly clip, which, in itself, is attached to the fur trimming garnishing her hat. Juvia completes her outfit by fastening a light brown belt around her waist and wearing complimenting, dark brown, thigh-high boots. She also no longer curls her hair, instead letting it fall in thick waves past her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia is first introduced portraying an emotionless face, seeming more secluded from everyone, including members of the Phantom Lord Guild. After she joins Fairy Tail, she develops a happier demeanor. She is obsessed with Gray Fullbuster to the point of considering anyone who shows affection towards him a rival. And when Meredy threatened him, Juvia loses her calm demeanor and entered a somewhat satanic-appearing state that frightens Meredy and even Erza. Juvia also seems  to have a slight masochistic side; upon making a mistake, she asks Gray to spank her as punishment, saying it's her \"hobby\". She's also very polite towards other, typically addressing others with honorifics, though she addresses Gray as \"Gray-sama\" only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia tends to refer to herself in third person, and often says \"drip, drip, drop\" due to the rain she used to constantly bring everywhere with her. Juvia has a wild imagination in which she tends to fabricate relationships and love rivals. By X792, she also appears to have affectionately adopted or picked up Gray's habit of shedding clothes spontaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2nd Choice: Other Guilds. That's right its time to add more names and info about the other guilds female members. (Hooray)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
