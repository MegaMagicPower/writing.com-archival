The editor of the Daily Tombstone paces on all fours and lets out a stressed out meow. \u201cAnother day,\u201d she moans. \u201cAnother disaster waiting to happen. When is that Tim going to get in here? I can\u2019t take the anticipation. I know he\u2019s gonna make something bad happen. I just know it.\u201d The sphinx groans and lowers her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It was a wonder that you managed to score a job in a monster city like Fearfield. However, you had little to no choice. You were a jinx. You managed to mess up every job in your hometown in the human world so badly you were exiled to the monster world so you wouldn\u2019t be a danger to anyone else. You found yourself in Fearfield, a city said to me the most dangerous monster city for any human to live in. Once in Fearfield, you saw a poster on the Daily Tombstone building that said they were looking for a photographer and you decided that since you were quite skilled with a camera, you\u2019d apply. The only problem, you had no idea that the editor in charge was an 850ft tall man eating sphinx. Lexi\u2019s secretary let you in to see the sphinx, the only day she was glad to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon meeting you, Lexi didn\u2019t see you as a potential employee so much as a meal and was circling you with a sinister grin. \u201cSo?\u201d asked the sphinx. \u201cA human applying for a job meant for monsters? That\u2019s a laugh.\u201d \u201cNo ma\u2019am, I\u2019m completely serious. I\u2019ve lost so many jobs and I saw the offer in your window so...\u201d Lexi licked you before you could finish that sentence. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a raw human in years. What to do? What do I have to lose? Seeing as I\u2019m a sphinx, I\u2019ll cut a deal with you. If you can answer my riddle, I\u2019ll give you a job, heck, if by some miracle you get it right, I\u2019ll give you the best job security you could hope, n matter how badly you might screw up. Answer incorrectly and...\u201d Lexi snapped her jaws to show you how dangerous she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do anything you say ma\u2019am,\u201d you said. \u201cI\u2019ll take your challenge.\u201d Lexi circled you before getting ready to announce her riddle. \u201cOkay my little snack, here\u2019s my riddle...\u201d By some miracle your bad luck worked to your advantage that day because a clock tower rang loudly. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d asked Lexi. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s quarter to one.\u201d You replied. Lexi looked at her watch. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Wait... I mean... that.. D\u2019oh!\u201d \u201cToo late, I answered your riddle correction.\u201d Lexi banged her head on the ground. \u201cDamn it all! Welcome to the Daily Tombstone.\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d you yelled in victory</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the present day, Lexi lets out a groan. \u201cMe and my big mouth. Who would\u2019ve thought that one little human could cause so much damage and destruction. Suddenly, Lexi hears Kiki calling her. \u201cLexi,\u201d she says. \u201cTim is here.\u201d \u201cSend him in.\u201d It was at this moment, you walk in under Lexi\u2019s door and wave at your employer. \u201cStay away from me,\u201d warns Lexi. \u201cYou\u2019re a jinx. Don\u2019t come another step closer.\u201d As Lexi backs up, her glasses fall off and she lets out a grunt. Lexi tries to walk up to her glasses, but you get there first. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Lexi,\u201d you say as you walk forward. \u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d \u201cNO!\u201d yells Lexi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you pick up Lexi\u2019s glasses and shake your hand. \u201cLooks like they haven\u2019t been cleaned in weeks. I\u2019ll take care of it boss. You grab a piece of cloth hanging from a nearby table and by tugging on it to clean Lexis glasses only to knock over a hot container full of coffee all over Lexi as the sphinx screams in pain. \u201cHOT!\u201d \u201cSorry!\u201d you yell. \u201cLexi, your glasses.\u201d You walk forward and try to hand Lexi her glasses as she\u2019s recovering from the coffee but then you accidentally trip and fall forward shattering the glasses as Lexi lets out a groan. \u201cThat was my last pair of glasses.\u201d She moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had happened a lot since you started working at the Daily Tombstone. You were so much of a jinx that even the monsters weren\u2019t immune. You spilled the ink you were supposed to load into one of the printing presses and caused it to break down one time. Put several monsters in the hospital due to chain reaction disasters and they even had to replace thirty security cameras because you managed to damage them unintentionally while cleaning them. The fact is, you were bad luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, sorry Lexi, I was just trying to...\u201d Lexi gives an angry look but cracks a forced smile. \u201cAccidents will happen,\u201d she says in a restrained tone. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d You let out a sigh. \u201cSo what\u2019s my job today boss? Oh, I could empty out the ashtrays.\u201d \u201cOh no,\u201d growls Lexi. \u201cI remember what happened last time you cleaned the ashtrays. Why do you think I banned smoking from the building.\u201d \u201cCheer up Lexi, your fur grew back after three weeks.\u201d Lexi just growls at you and you step back. She was forbidden from eating you due to the contract, but she could still get mad. \u201cLet me just give you today\u2019s assignment,\u201d she says with a sigh. \u201cAnd then we won\u2019t have to see each other until the end of the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d You say in enthusiasm as you salute your sphinx employer. So what are you going to do today?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ll be working with Mazee for today\u2019s mission.\u201d \u201cAlright,\u201d you say. \u201cThanks Lexi.\u201d Lexi lets out a purr and tries to look happy for you despite her dislike of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you\u2019re done speaking with your sphinx boss, you go to find Mazee, your girlfriend. Sure she was a skyscraper sized rat who would be as big as a sumo wrestler had she been human sized, but the wererat was the most loyal monster to you in the entire building. A lot of people wondered what you saw in the rodent giantess, but many monsters asked Mazee what she saw in you so it evened out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember how you met Mazee. You were on her desk cleaning it under Lexi\u2019s orders when you slipped and fell on a piece of cheese pizza and got stuck. Mazee took the slice and you seriously thought she was going to eat you, but instead she picked you off and sure enough you two were steady. You considered yourself lucky to have such a caring girlfriend even if she was a rat. It was just as well one of the monsters was your girlfriend, that gave you some protection from predators like Aurelia and Grace and unwanted suitors like Beth and Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you\u2019re thinking about your mission with Mazee, you suddenly remember how much bigger the hallway was to you than it was to the monsters. The only reason you got far enough to Lexi\u2019s office today was because Willa gave you a lift. You figured Lexi was too busy managing the repairs to the building to put in human sized walkways. You let out a sigh but then you feel tremors. A monster was coming. Before you could find out which one, you feel something tapping on your head, it looked like a giant worm but you knew it was in fact, Mazee\u2019s tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed a ride pipsqueak?\u201d asks a voice behind you in a friendly tone. You look behind you to see a pair of giant black furred clawed feet with jean covered legs bigger than skyscrapers. You look up closer to see the sky obscured by a huge furry belly and you realize that Mazee had come to you. The giantess wererat bends over and smiles to you as she swings her tail. You still cannot believe how beautiful the rat giantess was. From her shiny midnight black hair that reached down to her mountain sized butt cheeks to her generously sized chest and belly big enough for you to live on, this rodent was a bombshell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard Lexi screaming and I thought you\u2019d be here,\u201d your girlfriend says as she lowers her clawed finger for you to climb on. \u201cWhy do you torture her so?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d you say nervously. \u201cI just want to help.\u201d Mazee rubs your head as if you\u2019re a pet and smiles, showing her buck teeth normal for a rat. \u201cI\u2019d be careful if I were you Tim. I think that sphinx is out to get you.\u201d \u201cNo way Mazee, she can\u2019t eat me, besides, why would my boss want to kill me? She did say I was the best photographer she has.\u201d Mazee rolls her eyes. \u201cYeah, hard to find a photographer you can just hide in your pocket. Speaking of which, where should I keep you for today\u2019s mission?\u201d\u2028<br>\r\nMazee rubs her chin before she decides to place you...</span></div></div>",

Let down your hair.\" Mazee laughs at your joke as you start to climb up into the black jungle that is your girlfriend's head. You hold on tight and grab hold of a tree trunk sized lock as Mazee begins walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but sniff the aroma of her hair. It sort of smelt like blueberries. You take it Mazee's been using a new shampoo. \"I don't know why people are always calling rats dirty. I've never smelled better.\" Mazee blushes slightly as she gets in her red muscle car and starts to drive away. \"Don't forget Tim,\" your girlfriend says. \"Mom and Dad are visiting tonight.\" You gulp and hold on tight to Mazee's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they still not thrilled about their daughter dating a human. After all your sisters still see me as a snack.\" Mazee lets out a sigh. \"Don't remind me, I regret letting Brianna borrow my cookbook.\" You shiver on your girlfriend's head. \"I can never eat sushi again. So Mazee, what's our mission for today my goddess among vermin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh,\" says Mazee as her tail twitches in her seat. \"You're extra sexy today.

She had red skin, long black hair, and green eyes. She had the horns, ears, and from what you could see, legs of a goat. But that was not what caught your attention. What caught your attention were her breasts. They were gargantuan. They had to be at least twice the size of yoga balls. Those must have been too heavy for her to move on her own power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cali Denverson?\" Mazee asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's me. Come on in.\" Cali replies as she wheels away from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee thanked her and walked in. As she did, you noticed that Cali had an elevator in her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is your friend?\" Cali asks, looking at you through Mazee's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is Tim. He'll be working with me. Shall we go to the living room?\" Mazee asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCali nods and the three of you head into the living room. Mazee sits down on the couch and, taking you out of her hair, sets you on the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee pulls out a tape recorder. \"Why don't we start the interview by having you introduce yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCali nods. \"My name is Cali Denverson. I am... was a doctor and Fearfield General Hospital. I was studying LOS, hoping to find ways to improve the strength of werewolves with it, when something happened. I can't remember what, but somehow, it gave me LOS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised. LOS, short for Lactose Overload Syndrome, was a condition that caused women's breasts to become extremely large and fill with milk that they can't lactate. But it only affected werewolves, succubi, and gargoyles. How did Cali, a satyr, get it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I become unable to properly do my duties, but I was given the opprotunity to work from home. I now give medical advice on Fearfield General's website.\" Cali continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry.\" You say. You felt bad for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It gets worse. These things?\" She says, referring to her breasts. \"They're still growing. I've run tests. They will never stop getting bigger. But it's not all bad. I'm a spokeswoman for the condition now. And being a satyr with a condition that only werewolves, succubi, and gargoyles get has made me a minor celebrity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee smiles. \"I'm glad you've turned you're condition into something good.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next two hours, Mazee continues the interview. As she did, you learned more about Cali. She was a nice woman, and she did want to help people, though she missed her job as a proper doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end, you got up to use the bathroom.

This should be a top page.\" Cali smiles and waves. \"Come back anytime Ms. Robinson. Mr. Mertins.\" Mazee takes you and gets into her car before driving away. \u201cWell that is a rarity,\u201d said Mazee. \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought it would be possible for a monster other than a werewolf, gargoyle or succubus to get LOS.\u201d \u201cThat poor woman,\u201d you say. \u201cAt least succubi have magical powers and gargoyles are strong enough to carry the weight.

I\u2019d kill my back.\u201d You hold your nose as you imagine Mazee with LOS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you cough because you\u2019re desperate to change the subject. \"Oh. I'm looking forward to getting back to the Daily Tombstone with this story.\" \"I'm not looking forward to you getting back,\" says Mazee. \"Not with those vicious man-eaters working there.\" \"Mazee, aren't you overreacting.\" \"Tim,\" says Mazee. \"Aurelia got a new cookbook for her birthday a few weeks ago and I think she's itching to try some recipes with human in them. I also saw Grace eating a breakfast burrito that was screaming.\" \"Come on, Mazee. You're worrying too much. Those two are the only two predators.\" \"One predator is enough. One day, either that fat-bottomed werecheetah or that sneaky werejackal is going to chomp you and spit out your bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip nervously. \"Well, when you put it that way, Mazee.\" At that moment, you and Mazee come to a red light. However, that was when there's a sudden \"THUD!\" sound and Mazee yells as the car is jerked forward. You fall off Mazee's shoulder and land in between her toes. You immediately plug your nostrils from the stench of Mazee's feet. Given that Mazee's a rat, you don't want to know what those toes have been touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee pulls you out of her toes and places you back on her shoulder before she looks in her mirror and sees that she was rear-ended by a black car. Mazee bites her lip and puts her car in park before she goes out to confront the driver. She angrily pounds on the black car and chatters her rat teeth. \"Hey you moron!\" she yells. \"What's the big idea speeding at a red light!?\" Out of the car comes a young (you'd say teenaged) male orc in a blue shirt and gray pants. Surprisingly, this orc is shorter than Mazee. He sees Mazee and is beyond scared at the angry wererat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. It's only a little scratch. No need to lose your temper.\" However, Mazee points to her car hatch and shows that the door is bent, the rear lights are shattered and the mirror is cracked. \"That is more than a little scratch! You owe restitution!\" The orc boy just twitches his fingers. \"I'm broke. But there is something I can give you.\" The orc holds up a bottle that appears to be shaped like a pair of butt cheeks. It was as big as a barrel to a human like you. \"I just bought this potion from a werehippo sorceress. I was planning to use it to get revenge on a cheerleader who turned me down on a date. Just one drop will make a monster's butt expand to 8 times its owners' size. You can use it on enemies.\" Mazee takes the potion and gives a look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What use would I have for such a....\" That was when Mazee got an idea. \"This could be just what you need, Tim?\" \"Huh?\" you ask. Mazee then glares at the orc. \"You got yourself a deal. But this had better work.\" Mazee gets back into her car and soon arrives back at the Daily Tombstone. \"Mazee,\" you say. \"That's a terrible deal. It will cost hundreds of skulls to fix your car.\" \"Tim,\" says your wererat girlfriend. \"Think. This could be just the thing. There's only enough for one predator but if you use this on Grace or Aurelia, it will make them too heavy to chase after you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee hands you the vial and you grunt as you try to hold it. When you finally get a grip, you realize something.This could actually work out in your favor. But who to use the potion on?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At that moment, Aurelia has bent over as she works to fix the printer. \"Anna-Maria really did a number on this machine,\" she says as she growls. \"As if I didn't have enough to fix with Tim running afoul of everything. Makes me wonder what I'm going to do when I finally eat him. Oh well.\" Suddenly, Aurelia grumbles and her good eye twitches. \"Ra Almighty!\" she yells. \"I think I've got a wedgie. Cree must've shrunk my panties in the wash! That's I what I get for trusting somebody who doesn't wear clothes at all to do my laund... urgh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe potion works instantly and Aurelia's butt in seconds is as wide as she is tall. The jackal giantess looks back and sees her ginormous booty and drops her jaw as she wiggles her minuscule tail. \u201cWhat the... whoa!\u201d Aurelia has to grab onto the printer in order to hold her balance as her butt is shaking and threatening to knock her to the ground. \u201cHoly cow!\u201d you yell in surprise. \u201cThat stuff really works!\u201d Into the room walks Beth who drops her jaw. \u201cWhat have you been eating, Aurelia?\u201d she asks. \u201cYour butt is bigger than mine and Fate\u2019s put together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelia gives a growl. \u201cCan it, Beth! I didn\u2019t eat anything different today than I usually do. Alright, so maybe I did eat a drug addict human yesterday but all he did was leave me holed up in the bathroom for half an hour.\u201d Aurelia then holds her stomach again and then her butt expands again to the point where it\u2019s three times as big as her. Since Aurelia\u2019s body is very skinny, she was having trouble holding her balance and slipped slightly, crushing the printer and splattering black, cyan, yellow and magenta ink all over her butt, leaving a huge stain that looked like a monstrous face with evil eyes and sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how it happened,\u201d growls Aurelia. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure it\u2019s Tim\u2019s fault. Oh well, looks like it\u2019s time to break for lunch.\u201d Aurelia gives an evil smirk and shows her sharp teeth before licking her chops. You gulp as you see the amazingly pear-shaped jackal moving towards you. But as Aurelia steps forward, her butt keeps getting bigger, to the point where it looked like it belonged to a MUCH larger monster girl. It looked three times too big for a werehippo\u2019s behind, to say nothing of a werejackal like Aurelia. The big fleshy pair of spheres was even dragging across the ground. Aurelia gives an evil laugh as she's about to close in on you but then grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt had gotten so large, it was stuck in the hallway. You let out a laugh as the predator crosses her arms and growls. Mazee gives a smirk. \"Serves you right for always trying to eat my boyfriend.\" Aurelia grit her teeth. \"Quit gawking and get me out of here, Mazee. Ouch!\" On the other side, Tara is literally kicking Aurelia's butt. \"Aurelia! Get your big butt out of the way!\" \"What do you think I'm trying to do, carrion-face!\" Tara angrily kicks Aurelia again and Aurelia grabs her stomach in pain, right before she lets out a massive fart into Tara's face and makes her scream. \"I've been poisoned!\" \"Well <i>excuse</i> me!\" yells Aurelia angrily. \"If I knew this would happen, I would never have eaten that burrito for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelia then heard a creaking noise. \"What the?!\" You and Mazee gasp and Mazee grabs you before running off as the floor begins to sink. At that moment, the hallway explodes as Aurelia's butt swells to 10 times its owner's size. Aurelia screams and falls back as the floor breaks and she falls through several floors. Lexi hears the commotion and runs to check it out. \"What the film flam!? Oh my gosh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelia was at the bottom floor and had landed...</span></div></div>",

Both of you laughed, and headed for the stairs to go see her better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you two a few minutes to do so, since Aurelia had fallen all the way to the basement floor. When you got there, the sight was unbelievable. You had to squeeze in because Aurelia's butt filled up half of the room, and actually was poking out of the hole in the ceiling. Poking out from under the mountain of ass was Aurelia's hands and head. And she was very angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unbelievable. You've really done it this time, Tim.\" Aurelia said, furious. \"My butt's so gigantic and heavy that I'm pinned under it. I'd need 12 cranes to move this much ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee laughed. \"Hey, at least Cree might get some fun out of it.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurelia growled, but before she could say anything, Lexi walked into the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL DID YOU THIS TIME, TIM?

However, Not once does Aurelia's behind get any bigger, making you and Mazee very confused. \"I don't understand,\" you say. \"Her butt is supposed to enlarge to the size of a monster truck.\" Mazee grits her teeth. \"I know what happened,\" she says. \"That orc kid ripped us off so he wouldn't have to pay for damaging my car!\" You let out a sigh. \"Oh well,\" you say. \"I'm really sorry, Mazee.\" Mazee lets out a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what neither you nor Mazee knew was was the potion was a delayed effect potion and you had left it out near Aurelia\u2019s cup of coffee. At that moment, Fate comes walking by and sees the potion, not knowing what it was. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d asks Fate as she picks up the vial. \u201cHmmm. It looks like a sweetener of some kind. I remember seeing Aurelia here earlier. This must be hers.\u201d Fate then sniffs the potion and then rubs her double chin. \u201cIt sure smells good. I don\u2019t think Aurelia would mind if I used some of it.\u201d Fate brews a pitcher of coffee and pours in some of the potion, believing it to be sweetener. The purple gargoyle pours herself a cup and walks away drinking the brew right before Harley comes in and rubs her head. \u201cAye, aye, aye,\u201d says the wereboar woman. \u201cI got overzealous and drove all the way to Dreadberry before I realized what happened. I need a drink. Rapido.\u201d The Latina wereboar spots the cup of coffee that Fate had just brewed and then poured herself a glass. \u201cGracias, Fate.\u201d says the goddess-sized porcine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Harley leaves, Emma is walking by. However, she doesn\u2019t notice the coffee pot, mostly because of her frankly terrible eyesight. The polar bear giantess notices the potion and squints before she licks her lips. \u201cI thought we were out of honey.\u201d Said the bear giantess. Emma dripped some of the potion into her mouth and lapped it up as Pan-Li walked by the pick up a donut from the box. As Pan-Li takes one bite into the donut, Emma taps her on the back. \u201cPan-Li,\u201d says Emma. \u201cYou have got to try this honey. It tastes like ambrosia of the gods.\u201d Emma pours the potion on Pan-Li\u2019s donut and Pan-Li takes a bite before she moans in delight and then devours the rest of her donut. As Emma licks up a few more drops of \u201choney\u201d, she pours it on five more donuts before she and her fellow bear titaness walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the bears were out of the way, Tara the vampiress and Bea the succubus came in. Tara was scratching the scarred half of her face and groaned. Beatrice rolls her eyes before she takes a potioned donut and Tara pours herself an extra large cup of the tainted coffee. \u201cYou know, Tara,\u201d says Beatrice. \u201cYou seem stressed out. I know a good spa in Dreadberry that we can go to after we punch out this afternoon. Perhaps Prima and Atlanta can do something about that face.\u201d Tara gives a growl before downing her coffee. \u201cMy,\u201d says Bea as she bites into her donut. \u201cAren\u2019t we nasty today. Well, the offer still stands. I just hope that Lee isn\u2019t there. That woman is a tramp with no control over her libido.\u201d Tara gives a scoff. \u201cThis coming from a succubus? Ugh. This coffee tastes a little off.\u201d Lee swallows before speaking and walking away. \u201cSo does this donut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the succubus and vampiress leave, Yulong and Blake come in. Blake took a donut and bit into it as Yulong poured herself a cup of coffee and then put some herbs in it. She sniffed it and noticed it was a little cool and then blew flames from her mouth to heat it up. \u201cYulong,\u201d says Blake to the elderly Chinese dragoness. \u201cYou\u2019re old and wise. What am I doing wrong?\u201d \u201cYou are referring to Tim, right?\u201d asks Yulong to the weretiger. \u201cMy advice is to find somebody else. He\u2019s already dating Mazee. Trying to steal another\u2019s lover will only end in tragedy.\u201d Yulong drinks her coffee as Blake finishes her donut. \u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d says Blake. \u201cYou and your husband have been happily married for 200 years.\u201d Yulong shakes her head and she and Blake both leave, leaving Cleotiti and Hecate to walk in. Both were dressed in leg warmers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleotiti was panting to herself before she poured herself some coffee. \u201cCome on, Hecate,\u201d she says weakly. \u201cI agreed to join you for your new exercise regime, but don\u2019t you think you\u2019re overdoing it? We jogged 27 blocks before we got to work.\u201d Hecate eats one of the same tainted donuts that Blake and Bea ate before speaking. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cleo,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been getting pudgy lately and I don\u2019t want to be as big as my mom any time soon.\u201d \u201cAnd how big is Diana Howler, anyway?\u201d asks Cleo. \u201cUgh. Bad coffee.\u201d Hecate lets out a sigh. \u201cLet me put it this way; if she was human-sized, she\u2019d weigh half a ton. I don\u2019t want that to happen to me. Most of the girls in my family are blimps.\u201d \u201cSays the wolf who just ate a glazed donut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the wolf and mummy leave, Ari comes forward and looks at the coffee pot. The weresheep looks around before she grabs the entire coffee pot and slurps down the entire contents before quickly leaving.\u201d As Ari leaves, Willa comes forward and growls. \u201cRoot!\u201d yells your bunyip landlady in her Australian accent. \u201cThat selfish sheep yobbo drank all the coffee. I guess I\u2019ll just have some milk.\u201d Willa picks up some milk and pours herself a glass and then grabs one of the donuts that was covered in the potion, leaving only one left. She dips the donut into her milk and then bites into it before drinking the milk. As Willa leaves, Lexi shows up and your boss gives a growl to herself. \u201cLast donut again,\u201d says Lexi. \u201cBetter grab it fast before Grace sees it.\u201d Lexi has no idea about the potion on the donut and then bites into it before gagging. \u201cYuck!\u201d yells the sphinx editor. \u201cGarbage!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi growls as she walks away. She then tosses the donut in the trash in disgust before stomping away. Mazee comes around the corner with you on her shoulder. \"Well,\" says Mazee with a sigh. \"I'll just call my auto club and... hello!\" Your rodent girlfriend picks Lexi's donut out of the trash and shakes her head. \"Somebody threw out a perfectly good donut.\" Mazee bites into the donut and you look in shock. \"Mazee!\" you yell. \"That's trash!\" Mazee gives a scoff. \"Tim,\" she says. \"I'm a rat. What do you expect?\" What neither you nor Mazee could possibly know is that Aurelia was indeed under the potions power and it would be an hour until the potion took effect. However, Aurelia was only one of 15 girls to be affected by the potion.</span></div></div>",

The succubus was driving her car all the way to Dreadberry while Tara rode in the backseat inside of a coffin to protect herself from the sun. \u201cThis is the last time I carpool with you, Tara,\u201d says Beatrice as she wags her devil-like tail. \u201cI feel like an undertaker.\u201d \u201cI already had half my face burned up in the sun because of that moron, Tim,\u201d says Tara with venom in her voice. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to let the rest of my body burn as well. This salon better be worth it, Beatrice. After all, it\u2019s in Dreadberry. I\u2019m a city girl, born and raised. These hicks better know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Bea just lets out a sigh and then grunts and scratches her large throbbing purple backside with her sharp red fingernails. \u201cGee,\u201d says Bea. \u201cI must\u2019ve shrunk my underwear in the wash. I\u2019ve got one killer wedgie.\u201d Tara is feeling similarly uncomfortable. \u201cOh,\u201d groans the vampire giantess. \u201cThis coffin is feeling tight. I knew they ripped me off. I\u2019m going to complain to Mattress Titan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn\u2019t long until both nocturnal monster girls reached Dreadberry. Dreadberry was a small town in the countryside. The town was so small that they had a sheriff rather than a large police force. Fortunately for Tara, the sky was rather cloudy and she could leave her coffin, albeit with a lot of effort. Her upper body had no trouble, but her lower body wasn\u2019t budging. Bea had to grab Tara by wrists and pull her out, causing both of them to fall down in front of the door to a spa that read \u201cPrimordial Earth\u201d. \u201cOutgrowing your coffin are you?\u201d asks Bea. Tara gives a hiss. \u201cAre you saying that I\u2019m fat?!\u201d Beatrice lets out a sigh and then rolls her eyes. \u201cNever mind,\u201d she says. \u201cNever mind.\u201d Both the succubus and the vampiress try to go through the door at once but fail to notice that their butts have gotten rounder and they both struggle as they try to squeeze through. \u201cOut of my way!\u201d yells Tara. \u201cYOU get out of my way!\u201d yells Bea. Both of them wind up bending the door as they both squeeze in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028There were two stylists in the salon. First was a large pink-skinned and purple red haired leviathan, a type of aquatic dragon with thin glasses and an hourglass figure. The other stylist, to Tara\u2019s surprise was a titanic and obese woolly mammoth with long with hair dressed in an outfit that made her look like a pachyderm version of Storm. Tara looked at the mammoth woman who was getting a chair ready and then looked back at Bea. \u201cMust be a loxodon subspecies.\u201d Beatrice and Tara walked forward, not noticing that both of their rears were much bigger than they remembered. Beatrice\u2019s behind was too big for her skirt to hide and exposed her screaming soul print underwear, whereas Tara\u2019s purple jeans were coming apart at the seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d says the mammoth in an African American accent. \u201cWelcome to... oh my gosh!? What happened to your face!?\u201d Tara gives a growl. \u201cNone of your business. Can you fix it.\u201d The leviathan bites her mouth. \u201cBaby,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re beauticians, not plastic surgeons. From the look of your face, I\u2019d say it\u2019s beyond help.\u201d Tara gives a hiss and then Bea has to run in to calm her down, unintentionally knocking the leviathan woman down with her butt that was now as wide as she was tall and was touching her upper back. \u201cCalm down. We\u2019ll just take the works. My friend is very stressed out.\u201d The mammoth gives a scoff. \u201cThat was obvious. We\u2019ll start you up with a massage.\u201d Both Bea and Tara lay down with their large behinds up in the air. The stylist chairs must\u2019ve been reinforced with solid steel given it could still hold them. Tara\u2019s pants had just about been murdered, showing Batgirl-print underwear while Bea\u2019s behind was so big that her tail looked undersized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeil!\u201d yells the leviathan giantess. \u201cGet out here!\u201d \u201cI heard you!\u201d Both Beatrice and Tara look in surprise as the leviathan comes back with a human man who looked like he was in his forties, albeit his hair had already turned gray. The human man looked up in surprise at Tara and Bea\u2019s massive rears that now dwarfed the rest of their bodies. \u201cUh,\u201d said Neil. \u201cYou two young ladies wouldn\u2019t happen to be related to a Mngwa named Michelle would you?\u201d Both Tara and Bea (who obviously hadn\u2019t noticed the transformation) both blink. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d asks Bea in confusion. \u201cUh,\u201d says Neil. \u201cNever mind.\u201d Tara gives a growl. \u201cDon\u2019t think you can literally walk all over me, human,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you hurt me during the massage, it\u2019s down the hatch.\u201d Tara points to the inside of her mouth as Bea looks on in embarrassment. The leviathan just gives a smug smile. \u201cHer,\u201d she says. \u201cI like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Who does Neil get started on first?</span></div></div>",

It shouldn't be a problem getting her to drink this potion.\" You nod your head. That made sense. Grace was the food critic at the Daily Tombstone for a reason. She had a voracious appetite and you didn't know any kind of food that she'd outright refuse to eat. That's why you were afraid of her. You knew that there were some restaurants in the monster world with humans on the menu, which meant that being a human devouring monster was technically Grace's job. To make matters worse was that she acted so friendly. You didn't like the idea of being sent to assist a giantess who could decide to eat you at any moment's notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, when you and Mazee return to the Daily Tombstone, you hear a scream and then you witness from the shadows on the wall, Grace dropping an unfortunate human victim into her awaiting mouth. You gasp and turn pale white as Grace walks from the corner, having swallowed her prey as she was now licking her lips and tapping her stomach as she shook her already quite large behind from side to side. \"Hey, Tim,\" says the cheetah giantess as she walks away. \"Mazee.\" You shiver as she walks by and then you notice her pear-shaped figure. \"Are you sure we should be doing this, Mazee?\" you ask your giant rodent girlfriend. \"Grace already has a very big butt. I'd say only Fate and Beth outmatch her in that department.\" Mazee gives a scoff. \"And yet she's still able to move as fast as your standard werecheetah. We need to put some extra weight on her to keep her from catching you. She's taking a break for lunch before she reviews another restaurant. Now's a good a time as ever to feed her this potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Grace was in the cafeteria chowing down. She had quite a spread in front of her, including 9 hamburgers, 5 hotdogs, a large basket of nachos, and three Polter Colas. She wasted no time starting her lunch. \"Good grief,\" says Mazee. \"That werecheetah must've ate a black hole. How could anyone eat so much?\" \"Says the same girl who ate 5 whole cheese pizzas in a single sitting?\" you ask. \"Ha-ha,\" says Mazee sarcastically. What we need is to slip this potion into Grace's binge before that cheetah can be the wiser.\" Mazee gives a smirk as she crouches down on all fours just as Grace bit into a hotdog covered with ketchup and mustard. Once Mazee was close enough, she slipped the potion into Grace's...</span></div></div>",

I understand you two are dating, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to work with another field reporter. She definitely deserves a break from you. Everyone does. What she could possibly see in a boyfriend the size of a breath mint I\u2019ll never know.\u201d You nod your head. \u201cSounds fair. So, who am I working with today instead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to shake. There were five other field reporters beside Mazee. But most of them made you nervous. The exception being Willa Bong. Willa is Mazee\u2019s best friend and also your roommate, or rather house. The bunyip was a marsupial type monster and you lived in her pouch. Sure, she made you pay rent, but she was reasonable about it. You don\u2019t bother her and she doesn\u2019t bother you. But she was confused as to why a big monster like Mazee would have a tiny human boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next of the field reporters was Anna-Maria the kraken. She wasn\u2019t malicious, but you didn\u2019t like the idea of working with a skyscraper sized woman with the legs of a squid who keeps insisting she has psychic powers. Given all the spelling mistakes you have to correct for her, you don\u2019t see how she could be psychic with her brain power. And she was a total slob. Her work area was completely disorganized and she had a bad habit of spraying squid ink that you found totally foul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Pan Li, a pandaren. This monster took the term giant panda to a whole new level. But she only spoke Chinese, a language you couldn\u2019t understand and you had no idea if she was friendly or vicious towards humans. For all you knew, Pan Li could love filling her fat belly with tiny people, but she hasn\u2019t shown any malice to you... yet. But there was a rumor she served time in jail and you have no idea why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the most dangerous coworkers was that vampiress Tara. She has it in for you since you broke that window and exposed half her face to sunlight. You were lucky she wasn\u2019t killed, but Tara most likely wants revenge on you for that scar on her face. You couldn\u2019t even say anything nice about her because she\u2019d take it the wrong way and blow a fuse. You once saw her bite the head off a human who told her he never seen such a giant vampire because she thought he made fun of her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly was your least favorite field reporter and coworker in general, that weresheep Ari. You considered her a snake in sheep\u2019s clothing because she published information in her reports that wasn\u2019t true and managed to hide it from Lexi. You wanted to report the sheep giantess and get her fired for fraud but Ari warned you that she would swallow you whole if you snitched on her and she was serious because you saw her eat humans before. You were terrified that a sheep would actually eat people. That sheep also treated you like you were her slave and pushed you around whenever she got the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi opens her mouth to tell you today you\u2019re working with...</span></div></div>",

You immediately run out of the office and Lexi's eyes pop out. \"I can't believe it,\" she says with a smile. \"Tim was just in here and nothing broke. This must be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CRASH!\" Upon hearing that noise, Lexi's smile turns into her usual frown. \"Kiki, whatever you do, don't tell me what that was.\" Once you reach the cubicle area, you look around for any sign of Willa. Willa was Mazee's best friend and also the reason you get to work on time everyday. You gotta admit people would call you weird for living in her pouch, but Willa was a marsupial monster, didn't have any kids and she was obviously okay with it seeing as you paid her rent. You're just glad she was reasonable about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where was she, you'd think it would be easy to spot a 500ft hairless green kangaroo with the face of a fanged frog. As you're looking for Willa, you see a giant dragonfly buzzing overhead. The dragonfly lands on the table above you only for you to see something big, long and pink snatch it up. You knew where Willa was, in the direction the tongue was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you reach her desk, Willa is chewing on that dragonfly like bubblegum before she swallows it. The bunyip giantess puts her laptop away just as she looks down and sees you waving at her from between her clawed toes. \"Should've known I'd see you again soon mate. Guess I lost that lotto.\" You laugh at Willa's comment, thinking it's a joke and then the bunyip girl picks you up and stretches open the pouch in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Willa drops you, you land with a thump and a grunt in your recliner in the center of her pouch. \"Good thing I moved my easy chair.\" You say. Outside Willa rolls her eyes and then she hears a clicking noise. You had just turned on the TV and it was a kaiju movie. Willa lets out a sigh and starts to walk off with you in her pouch. \"What?\" you ask. \"I might as well do something until we reach our job.\" Willa lets out a grumble before she goes to the parking lot to get to her moped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Willa drives off, you start to lay down in your chair and yawn. \"Say Willa,\" you say. \"What's our mission for today?\"</span></div></div>",

And in the center of that crowd, was Satana herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was a chupacabra, standing at 850 feet tall. Her yellow eyes were blazing behind her red mask.

You flap your wings and brace for impact when you land with a splash. You surface and see that you're in a cup of ramen noodles the size of sea serpents. Pan-Li, the pandaren titaness is directly above you and looking down in confusion as she sucks on some of the noodles. \"Uh, hi there Pan-Li.\" Pan-Li greets you in Chinese. You still couldn't get why she didn't speak English since it was clear she understood it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to stand up but you trip on one of the noodles and splash back in the water. Pan-Li lets out a laugh at you as she brings her chopsticks down and grabs you by the leg. \"Pan-Li!\" you yell. \"Hey! What are you...!\" Pan-Li takes you up to her face and licks you slightly. She speaks in Chinese again before she places you on her shoulder. You wish you could understand what that literal giant panda says. But you were slightly afraid of her. Mazee, Yulong and Willa assured you that Pan-Li was friendly, but Emma, Kiki and Anna-Maria told you humans were her favorite food. But since you never saw Pan-Li actually eat a human you didn't know if this was true. You also remember hearing that Pan-Li was in Under Gloom but you didn't know what crimes she was charged with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan-Li sucks down the rest of her ramen before telling you in Chinese that it was time to go.

Pan-Li unlocked the door to your cage as you shook in place. You try to run to the back of the cage, but the female panda grabs you and lifted you in front of her bright white face with her black masked eyes and started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly set to work on something: Removing your clothes. You yelped as she tore them away easily, the size difference and her claws making short work of what you were wearing. You use you hands to cover your privates, making the ursa laugh again before she carried you,  the bear giantess swinging you back and forth by the ley that's between her fingers, into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't like this, and your feelings of foreboding was proven true when the black-&amp;-white bear spoke to you in Chinese, then set you down in the tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarning bells went off in your head, \u201cBATH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan-Li grabbed one of the water temperature knobs, then...WUSH! A waterfall of water comes right down over you, intently knocking you off your feet. \u201cAHHH\u201d\u2026you scream before you are submerged in the rapids. You feel yourself being washed away and your limbs hit against the hard surface of the tub. You just spin around and around. You manage to get your head above the waves and gasp in air but you see the black maw of the drain getting closer to you, you\u2019re going to go down the drain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't do anything against the current, the water is turning too rapidly and you try to fight but you can't make any distance. Your arms and legs are screaming from kicking and paddling trying to get you away. PLUNK! You turn from your swimming and see a giant hand come down out of the sky and insert the plug in the gaping blackness that was going to suck you under. But you are not safe yet, with the water no longer going down the current almost instantly shifts this time sending you backwards to the other side of the tub. And the water starts to rise. As it did, the took a large plastic bottle and opened it and poured some of the pink liquid into the filling tub then let the currents build up a good lather. Bubbles start to instantly form and multiply in their pink lavender-smelling foam while the pandaren kept her eyes locked on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tumbling water grows stiller, enough for you to get to the surface and gasp in several lungful of air. Panting, you look around. You're facing the other end of the tub. You hold yourself up and paddle around until you can turn and with shock you see the iceberg like bubbles growing from the other end while still paddling and kicking to stay afloat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne black-furred leg entered the hot water and stirred it, speeding the spread of all the bubbles. Pan-Li smiled sweetly at you as she bat her eyes as you while she slides into the tub, making the water level rise slightly around her. She turned the water off and leaned back, sighing in contentment as she relaxed in the warm, sudsy water. Now where was...Ah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break the surface of the water again, gasping. You look up to see Pan-Li smiling at you again, most of her was submerged so you could only see her from the waist up, You had to forcibly keep your gaze locked on her face, because the oanda woman before you was without any hint of shame in her expression. You   jerk as you're suddenly raised from the water by a huge object from under you. As you are lifted, you realize its a huge claw tip--one the the size of a skyscraper. You cling to the point for dear life and look to see just where you were. Your eyes widen as you saw you were on the claw of Pan-Li's big toe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan-Li giggled as she wiggled her toes, making you cling to her claw tip with a yelp. She did it again, and this time you fell down and landed between her big and second toe, the wet fur feeling thick and constraining around you before the toes close in around you tightly and the foot was quickly dunk back underwater before it was brought back up. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou see the pandaren smiling at you warmly. She definitely didn't speak English, and you definitely didn't speak Chinese, but it was obvious she was enjoying herself. This whole thing with using you as a bath-toy was just a warm-up and you both knew it. The she-bear then plucked you from between her toes and Pan-Li started rubbing you against a bar of soap, lathering you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soap gets into your mouth and eyes, but before you knew it, she stopped rubbing you against the soap bar and you were suddenly slammed into what felt like thick, wet cords. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan-Li's Fur! She was gonna...?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first part of her body she scrubbed was her chest, taking care to rub you especially over her full breasts. You moan as your body is dragged through the wet fur and strokes along the soft flesh underneath. You were moved further down, going to work on her stomach next. She pressed your head against her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan-Li pushed your head into her belly button and began to rotate you around. She popped your head out after her belly button was clean and lathered you up again. You were ragged and tired from your trip down Pan-Li\u2019s chest and wanted a small break to catch your breath. However,  you had no say in the matter, especially since there was that damned language barrier that made you and Pan-Li understanding one another impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan-Li looked you over quickly, her eyes sparkling, expression wide-eyed and a little crazy, like she'd just had twenty espressos and ridden a roller coaster. She was LOVING this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're plunged down again, passing above her pussy lips. You think that your next areas to clean will be there, but you move past the lips towards Pan-Li\u2019s feet. She lifts her foot off the bathtub floor and starts with the sole first. She worked her way to her heel, and then pushed you back across her sole. You are moved next to the balls of her foot before proceeding towards her toes. Pan-Li uses your head to scrub between each toe, much to your carnage. You\u2019re worked harder between the toes, first her big toe then each of other toe individually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan-Li pulls you up, her feet clean and you worn out. She had been pressing you a little too hard and your body ached. Looking up weakly, you look into the panda\u2019s eyes and see a fearsome lust directed down towards you. What you had just gone through was foreplay for what she had in store for your puny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Pan-Li got out of the tub and threw on a towel before setting you on the sink counter and unplugged the drain to the tub. As the water went down, she opened a drawer in the sink and pulled out a washcloth and wrapped it around you, and dries you efficiently and roughly with the hand towel. As she does so, she carries you through her place again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were no longer being rubbed and can see more than the fabric of the towel, you were set down and you gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO WAY! NOT HERE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in...</span></div></div>",

She looks at your puny body so close to her mother's enormous crack. You try to beg with the panda-woman, but it wouldn't have made any difference.  She drops you right on her left asscheek. You sigh, \"Thank God... She missed...\" She hadn't missed. She put you where she wanted you to land right there. As you try to stand up, you fall right back down and fell the ground.

You struggle to grab onto the fur surrounding the gigantic ass, but the strands were still slick from that bath she'd done as foreplay, and you can't get a grip.  As you slowly fall, you struggle harder but that only causes you to fall down faster. You gulp as you see her ravenous crack grow larger with each second...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan-Li giggled as she felt the slight irritation at her ass from your vain struggles. She decides to shake her ass a bit to get a better reaction and that slight shake caused her mountainous ass to smack you around and you fall off her cheek only to fall headfirst into her asshole. The light grows dimmer and you see one last shot at life and grab onto her ass hair. As you grab on, you see her anus. It's at least fifteen times bigger than you and it seems hungry for you... You gulp and hold on for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirm to break free but her crack's grip on you is too strong. All it does is cause her cheeks to jiggle and smack your face. It's almost as if the cheeks were mocking your futile efforts as outside, the behemoth moans deeply as she closes her butt cheeks up after feeling you sink deep in her ass!  You feel your whole world compress around you as the massive Pandaren clenches her butt a few times in response to your struggling before she gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan-Li moaned and she stood and stretched like a cat, shaking her butt the whole while to get a feel for you then reaches back and pokes a finger into her back side hole... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the hole that served as the way out widen slightly before something blocked it and you hear Pan-Li moaning and something jobbed into you.

It also smells of fermented Chinese style raochu, a type of liquor. You look at what little light you have from an opening as big as your finger and you see monster feet of all kind moving across the ground. There were feet from Chinese and Japanese dragons, kappas, jiang-shis, phoenixes, white weretigers, nues and even driders. Given the rapid movement of the feet, you were in a dance club. Outside, Pan-Li was dancing as well and shaking her booty, in turn jostling you around as you groan and have to hold on tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were even flame juggling Chinese dragons, singing cockatrices and guitar playing wereboars.

There was no way you could survive the fall from Pan-Li's butt to the ground, and even if you did and were somehow unhurt (which, with you being you, wasn't going to happen, you'd have to avoid getting stepped on by one of the other patrons of the club! Besides, as it stood since they were here and they were already planning to replace you, even if you MADE it to Mazee's sisters, Brianna and Cameron would most likely just give you back to Pan-Li once they learned you had been brought here by her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike it or not (and it most assuredly was the 'not'!)

As you look out, you're completely horrified. Both Brianna and Cameron are already talking with the red furred minotaur they mentioned and shaking his hands.

With her walking around so much, swaying her hips and jiggling her cheeks every step, you are bounced around heading deeper in her bowels. She is now laying on her belly so it is a 90 degree climb out of her ass. Her walls are slimy and hard to grab on to. You just pray that you can make it to her anus before she gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could just get to the beginning of Pan-Li's fur, you'd be able to climb out much easier and get away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n An hour passes and you were half way from where you started to her anal opening. If you could just get to her fur, this escape would be so much easier. After hours, you finally feel the tree trunk-like strands of fur outside of Pan-Li's fur and hastily grab it. The first breath of fresh air is truly beautiful as you manage to at least pull yourself from the waist up out of the infatuated Pandaren's butt crack. You take a deep breath and savor the air, it almost made you want to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so delighted that you didn't even notice how quiet the room was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...quiet...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that means...OH CRAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and pale at the sight of a massive hand-paw coming towards you! Shit! You took so long getting free, that Pan-Li had time to wake up and recover from the hangover! Dammit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirm, but all that causes is a moan from the Ursidae, who then plucks you from between her back cheeks with pathetically laughable ease and brings you around to her face. You continue to squirm in her grip before she brings you up to her lips and begins to make out with you, despite you tasting of her rancid bowels. Pulling you away, Pan-Li smiled at you and said something in Chinese, then laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up and stretches, making a show of it, you guess for your \"benefit\", before setting you down on her nightstand and heading to her bathroom. You hear the shower running and almost long for it yourself after so long in Pan-Li's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of waiting, Pan-Li emerges, fully dried off and wrapped in a towel, winks at you, then heads to her closet and after a few moments, comes out dressed in a pair of workout shorts and a tank top, along with some tennis shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp as she picks you up and...</span></div></div>",

From the looks of it, she was leaving and didn't remember about you. \"Thank goodness.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you realize something. You were still in a nightclub for monsters. This place was downright dangerous. There were all manners of monsters dancing about and as the nue bartender was cleaning a glass, you saw a cobra based naga slithering to the bar stool and climbing it. You yell and slide down the naga's coils as she takes her seat on the barstool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're on the floor, you have to immediately run out of the way as a cockatrice and a weresheep nearly trample you beneath their feet. You then pause as a weretiger and a shishi twirl in the direction where you were going to be walking. Then you have to slide to safety and then look up to see that red ox like minotaur, the very same one that Brianna and Cameron wanted to hook Mazee up with. You grit your teeth but remember you have to get out of that nightclub and maybe you could find some way to get to the other side of Fearfield and reach Mazee and Willa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you find yourself being kicked to the side by an oblivious dragon man and you bounce off the wall before landing in the glass of a flying pig woman. You spit out the tequila before you slip out of the glass and slide down it before you could be swallowed. You then bounce off the pig woman's stomach and groan because you accidentally wounded your foot and then you start to walk forward with a limp, dodging the fast moving feet of a qilin, wererabbit, kappa and phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each step your pain gets worse but you're almost to the door and you can get out of this nightmare nightclub.</span></div></div>",

God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came from behind you but you'd recognize Brianna's voice anywhere. You didn't bother turning around, you just tried to limp faster. It was no use as your girlfriend's sister snatched you in her paw easily and brought you up to eye-level. Cameron leaned over to see what her sister had grabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, is that a human? In a monster club? It must be the dumbest person alive,\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna laughed. \"You're not wrong! Take a closer look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron saw your fragile form and her eyes widened in surprise. \"Tim?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. \"Hi Cameron... hi Brianna,\" you said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here Tim?\" Brianna asked. \"You look a lot less deceased than what your obituary said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you loved Mazee, her sisters terrified you. They were monsters who'd rather have you for a snack than for a possible brother-in-law. It was no wonder you trusted them about as far as you could throw them... And since you couldn't even lift one of their pinkie toes, that wasn't saying much. You'd much rather have escaped and risked the dangers of the city streets rather than ever have to ask two of them for help. Right now though, there was no choice. You'd have to tell them what happened and pray they'd have mercy on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see the drunk panda at the bar?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna and Cameron looked over at Pan-Li. Your former captor was drinking and shaking her ass to the music, blissfully unaware that you'd escaped her foul prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She works with me at the Daily Tombstone. Lexi sold me to her to get rid of me! She made up that whole obituary so she could cover up what she did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna sighed. \"I should've known we'd never be lucky enough for you to be trampled in Chinatown. Couldn't you have stayed a prisoner of that panda and let everyone think you're dead? For Mazee's sake? Then she could've gotten a real man instead of kept pretending someone at the bottom of the food chain is good enough for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as that hurt, you didn't fire back. Brianna seemed to think they were obligated to return you to Mazee and there was no way in hell you would've said anything that could've endangered that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... sorry,\" you said reluctantly. \"May you please take me back to Mazee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Brianna grumbled. \"Let's just--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron cut her off with a loud, put-upon sigh. \"Really, Brianna? Take him back? You're lucky you're pretty because I obviously got all the brains. Think about it. Lexi wants him gone, Mazee thinks he's dead, no one knows we have him. This is the perfect chance to get rid of him once and for all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh!\" Brianna squealed in happiness at the realization. \"Good thinking, sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please! You can't do this!\" you cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna casually put her thumb over your face muffling your pleas. She licked her lips menacingly. \"I've been waiting for this day for a long time. I've been saving a recipe for just this occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait a minute!\" Cameron said. \"Why do you think you get to eat him? Without me, you'd just take him back to Mazee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm the one who found him in the first place. It's only right I get to eat him. You'd just waste hours giving him a makeover and ruin all his natural flavor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing would ruin his flavor more than being eaten with that garbage you prepare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna puffed in outrage. \"How dare you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the twins argued, you furiously squirmed in Brianna's grasp, trying to break free and run. This was exactly what you feared. Instead of getting help from Mazee's sisters, they just decided to put you on the menu. You were wondering how this could get any worse when you noticed black-and-white movement from the corner of your eye. Pan-Li was on her hands and knees around the bar. She'd finally realized you escaped and was looking for you. Other people in the club were starting to notice the twins heated argument. If they kept this up, Pan-Li would notice soon. Drunk or not, when she saw two wererats arguing over who got to eat a human they found, she'd put two-and-two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was worse, you wondered. Getting reclaimed by that psycho panda or ending up in the gut of one of these bloated rats?</span></div></div>",

Just when you thought you couldn't feel any lower, the two titans before you were planning both your execution and your replacement. You may have lived in a world of monsters, but these two <i>literally were monsters.</i> You struggled harder, not just in fear, but in actual anger now. The twins noticed and snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, poor Timmy-wimmy,\" Brianna said in baby talk. \"Does it make you sad that you're gonna be melted down into flab while Mazee gets hot and heavy with a real man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should feel grateful,\" Cameron said. \"We're going to make sure she gets a lifetime of happiness, something she could never get from you.

With another giggle she dropped you into it. She then pulled out a pot, filled it with water and put it on the stove to heat up. She grabbed a pack of noodles and placed it beside your glass. Pan-Li pointed at your miniscule form and said something to you. In spite of the language barrier, her meaning was obvious. \"Don't move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked out of the kitchen, swaying her hips as she did, and before she passed out of sight she gave you one last sultry look over her shoulder. The moment she was out of sight, you tried to escape, but the walls of the glass were too high and too smooth, and no matter how hard you tried to climb, you'd just slide down without making any progress whatsoever. \"I gotta get out of here,\" you thought. \"Who knows what she'll do next?! I could be part of those noodles she's making! No, no,\" you said to yourself. \"I'm being silly. She obviously likes me, so she can't be planning on eating me... Right? Damn it! How is my best case scenario here that I'm going to be savaged by a lovelorn panda?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed, and you could hear the sounds of Pan-Li getting ready. She began singing that damn song again as the water began to boil. Eventually she returned. She was wearing a new dress, similar in style to her old one, only this one was dark red with golden flowers on it. She had reapplied her make-up and black lipstick. Her hair was dry but still undone from her typical bun. She paused in her song to blow you a kiss before heading over to the stove and preparing her noodles. You watched her with a lump in your throat and every now and then she would look over at you to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not gonna eat me,\" you thought, trying desperately to reassure yourself. \"She's not gonna eat me, she's not gonna eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeated that mantra for several minutes until her cooking was done. She prepared a single plate with a massive portion of noodles for herself, then grabbed your glass and a bottle of wine, and sat down at her table. She tipped you out of the glass to fill it with wine, and caught you in her giant paw. Despite the admittedly wonderful smell of the meal she'd prepared, it was only when she looked at you that she licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour knees nearly gave out while standing in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not gonna eat me, she's not gonna eat me, she's not gonna eat--\"</span></div></div>",

She looked at you with seeming tenderness then raised you to her puckered lips. It surprised you how delicately she handled you as she kissed you, pressing you lightly against her lips. After several seconds the smallest tip of her tongue poked out and touched your face. She pulled you away as you gagged on her spit. She looked at you sultrily, with half-lidded eyes, and for just a moment you thought that the giant panda really did care about you too much too harm you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Pan Li said the only sentence you ever understood her say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim, yummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wink, she tipped her paw, causing you to fall directly into her bowl of noodles. It was like falling into a bunch of sticky ropes. You struggled to get free but the more you squirmed, the more trapped you became. Not even a minute later, you had somehow completely tied yourself up in noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan Li laughed and raised her chopsticks, clicking the tips together in a way that was both playful and menacing. To your relief, she didn't grab you right away. Instead she selected noodles near the edge of the bowl. Maybe she just wanted your fear to build up. If that was the case, it was definitely working. You watched as Pan Li brought the noodles to her mouth and greedily slurped them up. Despite how elegantly she was dressed, her table manners were atrocious. She chewed loudly, with her mouth open, and made almost obscene moans of pleasure as she devoured her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept trying to wriggle free of your bonds, or at least crawl out of the bowl, but to no avail. You must've looked ridiculous as Pan Li kept laughing at you as she continued eating. Quickly, the amount of noodles in the bowl got smaller and smaller. Even if you did miraculously get free, you knew the edges of the bowl were too high for you to climb. With amazing skill, Pan Li managed to finish off every noodle in the bowl, except for one final cluster in the center where you were imprisoned. Pan Li licked her lips in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pan Li, please!\" you cried out desperately. \"I thought we were friends! I have a girlfriend! Think of Mazee! She's always been nice to you! You don't have to do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan Li paused as if considering, then lowered her head to the bowl so that her face was all you could see above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan Li unleashed a disgusting belch into the bowl, washing you with a wave of stale air that reeked of noodles. Her face blocked any fresh air from entering and you coughed at the stink. Pan Li laughed as if it was the funniest thing she ever saw in her life. Wiping away a tear from her eye, she decided to get down to business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chopsticks descended with a grim finality, clutching the edge of the noodles entrapping you. She raised their end to her mouth and began to slurp. You were tied up on the other end, and struggled to get free. Slowly you were dragged closer and closer to the greedy hellhole that was her mouth. As you writhed, you were amazed when one arm finally got free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" you cried out triumphantly. Pan Li didn't seem concerned however, she kept eating at the same steady pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't underestimate me,\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you got the other arm free, then a leg. Pan Li's obscene munching continued. She was practically on top of you! With a final burst of strength, you got your other leg free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSUCCESS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and began running from your gluttonous doom... Only for your foot to snag at the last second on the final noodle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan Li giggled cutely, and you screamed as you were dragged up into the air, and were slurped into her mouth. Once you were inside, Pan Li dropped her chopsticks and leaned back in her chair. She moaned in satisfaction, tasting her wonderful prize. Inside, her mouth smelled just as foul as the belch she unleashed on you not a minute ago. The air was hot and moist, and though you tried to run to the front of her mouth, her tongue slammed into you, squishing you between it and her cheek. Pan Li was in ecstasy as she sampled your taste, running your puny body over hill sized taste buds. Her saliva soaked through your clothes, and bits of noodle still stuck to her tongue clinged to you instead. For several minutes you suffered her savage tongue lashing, until at last she relented. Your battered and bruised form laid defeated on her tongue. You were too weak to try to escape. You knew what would come next, and so did she. Maybe Pan Li didn't want to swallow. Maybe she wanted to enjoy your taste forever. But you both knew that was impossible, and, almost reluctantly to part with your flavor, he colossal tongue arched backwards and sent you sliding to the back of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan Li gave a final gulp and you were gone, sliding down into the depths of the panda girl's giant stomach. You landed with a splash in the tingling juices of her stomach, and found just enough strength to swim over to a semi-solid glob of rice. You collapsed on top of it, panting. Pan Li gave off a colossal belch even bigger than before, nearly deafening you inside her stomach, then patted her tummy happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this really the end?\" you thought. \"Digested inside a giant panda? Can't believe that bitch Lexi is actually going to win... I'm sorry Mazee...\" you thought, blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Pan Li gave off another, smaller, belch and smacked her lips, happy to have the taste of you in her mouth again even if it was fleeting. Tim was certainly the most delicious little human that Pan Li had ever eaten in her entire life. She knew from the moment she first saw him at work that she needed to have him inside her. It was just lucky that none of those other gluttons had snagged him first. That wererat certainly didn't know what she was missing, just dating him instead of devouring him. Pan Li sighed. She was sad that her and Tim's time together was over. Her only regret was that she could only eat Tim once, because she'd certainly eat him every day if she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final gulp, Pan Li finished off her wine and went to get ready for bed. She still had work tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

Pan-Li puts some incense in the room before she continues to laugh wickedly and started to unlock the door to your cage as you shake in place.

Pan-Li just smiled at her little living property as she continued to twist your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! No more!\" you pleaded, not caring that she couldn't understand your words, as she would clearly understand their meaning. But you started screaming again as Pan-Li smiled and shook her head 'no' and continued to twist your arm and break the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with one snap, your arm was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears were sent to your eyes and yells, shouts and cries of pain came from your mouth. As your screams died down, Pan-Li was still clutching you and was laughing; enjoying seeing the pain and suffering in her prey and started to squeeze you with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed a few more times, breaking some of your ribs before she spun on her heel and threw you like a fastball, making you feel like your flesh was going to rip from your bones from the G-force and the wind. before you slam into the back of a padded chair and bounced off it and landed with an impact that you were surprised didn't kill you onto the cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...the...HO SHIT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan-Li waddled right towards your direction and loomed over you, laughing as she looked down on you before she turned around and your view was filled with her massive, wiggling rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to move, but when you did, pain from your recent injuries shot through you and left you helpless and incapacitated as Pan-Ll slowly lowered her butt down and you whimpered when it looks like it will hit you. Surprisingly though, the booty freezes just before it crushes you. You look up to see Pan'Li's butt moving upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if she changed her mind when THUD! Pan-Li slams her booty down on you like two meteors of Armageddon and started bouncing up and down on you, as well as squirming in her seat as if trying to get a feel for you, causing you further pain as you scream as she shifts around on top of you. You HAD to get away from this or she could kill you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing your good arm, you reach up and clung to Pan-Li's stubby tail, which was big enough for you to live on. You couldn't get a very good grip and you're forced to have one hand support your entire body weight, but you were at least able to pull yourself free from being directly under Pan-Li. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan-Li stopped with her booty-play as she stopped hearing you screaming and she stood, checked the seat,  then grinned as she retched back with her hands and started searching to make sure you weren't dead.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou gulp as you watch her hands trail through the fur on her butt cheeks, hunting for you. you shuttered in terror at the thought. PLEASE don't let her check her tail! Finally, finding nothing, the hands pull away and out of your sight. You let out a breath you didn't realize you hand been holding, when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAA!\" You let out a scream of pain as a sudden shock runs through your body from Pan-Li's shock collar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all it took to make to loose your delicate grip and you fall. As everything zooms past, a massive black blur suddenly moves and you feel like you'd been struck with a freight train and you zoomed away and sent you flying where you smacked into the back of the padded chair's cushion again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel hurt and disoriented, but you can hear Pan-Li's laughing over the ringing in your skull.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPan-Li had kicked you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you feel the world stop spinning, you look up to see the female panda grinning at you, seemingly impressed and amused at what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she says something to you in Chinese that you can't understand. But you knew it wasn't good, if anything she was telling you what she was going to do to you now.  </span></div></div>",

As you start to become even more terrified for your life just as Pan Li used her knee to throw out your back as you yell and even spit out a tooth. Then the panda does a spinning kick to knock you with a grunt into the ceiling. As you're falling the bear giantess jumps and initiates a flying kick and knocks out a few more of your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're flying you recognize those attacks as kung fu moves. You were a training dummy for this sadistic panda. Panda then utilizes a jujutsu kick and you land hard on the ground before she punches the ground and pushes you into the wall.

You really wonder what she has planned for you but you'd be terrified to know to be perfectly honest. As you're wondering what will happen, Pan-Li speaks to an unknown person in Chinese. You start to bite your nails. As Pan-Li finishes the call she laughs and speaks in Chinese before slamming you back into the cage. You're biting your nails and it isn't long before things get much much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the front door and then Pan-Li answers it, revealing three monsters that were as big as Pan-Li. In the center there was an monster resembling a purple and frilled skinned clam with razor sharp teeth in a vertical mouth and six eyes running down her chest as well as a deep gray shell on her back. She was a shen, a shapeshifting mollusk monster. To the right of the shen was a bunyip that resembled Willa except she had lumpy teal skin instead of Willa's smooth yellow-green skin. To the left of the shen was a bright orange furred monster resembling an oragutan with clawed fingers but blonde hair and an aggressive face. She was a skunk ape judging from the yellow skunk stripes on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shen gives an evil smile and stretches out her mouth. \"So this is the new meat?\" she asks as you looks into your cage. Then the skunk ape girl lowers her head showing her sharp teeth and breathed at you. Her breath smelled like death. The bunyip even flicked her long tongue at you before speaking in an Australian accent. \"He's too small to make a decent snack, but I'd bet he'd make a good plug.\" All three of these monsters laughed at you and Pan-Li spoke in Chinese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the shen understood her. \"Pan-Li says she wants to introduce you to us,\" the shen says. \"My name is Nancy. I did time in Under Gloom for identity theft.\" Nancy then shape shifts into an evil smiling version of Mazee and then turns back to her humanoid clam form. The skunk ape girl smiles at you. \"I'm Rika,\" she says. \"They caught me running a telemarketing scam.\" Then the bunyip licked your body as you scream. \"And I'm Mildred. I was in for GTA.\" That's when you realize something. Pan-Li really did do time in prison and these must've been her friends from the hoosegow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Pan-Li,\" says Rika with a belch. \"Who gets to help you torture the bug first. I have some repugnant plans for him?\" \"It will be me,\" says Mildred as she grits her teeth. \"I want to swallow him whole, regurgitate him and repeat the process again and again.\" Nancy even shows her teeth as Pan Li laughs. She then speaks in Chinese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did she say?\" asks Rika. \"She says Rock, Paper, Scissors,\" says Nancy. \"And I like it.\" The clam giantess, the skunk ape and the bunyip all hold up their hands. \"Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho wins the chance to help Pan-Li torture you first?</span></div></div>",

As Mazee walks away, she sees Harley, the were boar delivery girl walking out with a stack of papers. \"Hey, Harley.\" Says Mazee. However, Harley looks at Mazee in concern and lets out a squeal before turning her head.

Is this another scheme to steal Tim from me?\" Blake just lifts her head and lets out a sigh. \"No need to worry about that, Mazee,\" she said. \"You don't have to worry about that ever again.\" Mazee was slightly worried but didn't think much about Blake's statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked away however, she bumped into her best friend and your roommate, Willa the bunyip. \"Oof.

I really hate to tell you this but... but....\" Mazee gave a worried look. \"Willa?\" she asks. \"Where is Tim?\" Willa just lowered her head as Mazee looked in horror. \"Mazee,\" said Willa. \"Tim is dead.\" Mazee gave a look of shock and dropped her coffee pot on the ground where it shattered right before she grabbed Willa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had both tears of sorrow and tears of rage in her eyes. \"Who was it?! Aurelia?! Grace?! Tara!? Who did...\" \"I don't know!\" yelled Willa. \"Lexi said that she sent him on a mission with Pan Li but says that when Pan Li wasn't looking, he fell off her shoulder and somebody in Chinatown trampled him to death.

The body was child girlish like, and was wearing clothes that any young girl would have wore. It was a shocking scene to see that a young girl was murder today, and you take a look at the wound, and it is just nothing but bloody. You had to hold your breath just as you walk into the bloody scene, while also not messing up anything that could screw the whole case. Then you notice something, there was a bullet right in the area, and it was a big one, perhaps big enough to a monster size to shoot down any head and blow it all together. It is now really disgusting to you as we have a child that is killed in the scene, but we got the bullet that can lead to who is responsible. \"The scene was downright bloody, but I found the bullet that killed the child.\" you shouted up to Tara, and she sighed annoyed again. \"Just bring it over you slave, I will take a look at it.\" she ordered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not you get yourself over here? You know, being small and all has its disadvantages you know.\" you complained to her, and then she relucantly walks over there and looks at the bullet. \"Oh man, oh man... it's really distrubiting piece of evidence right there..\" Tara said, noticing how disgusting the scene is right there and then. \"This is a pretty bad blood bath scene here. This is one of the monsters that got killed, and there is another one in the area not far from here. I don't know if this is a terrorist attack or not. Or perhaps one of those town fights between the cities of Horrorville, Terrordale, Fearfield, or whatever, who knows, but we got to for sure report this in.\" you told Tara, and you hope she isn't annoyed this time, and she smiles. \"Well, if it is one of the other towns, then I agree with you, and terrorist, say... you are quite useful.\" she smirked at you, but then spit at you. \"For a spit target.\" she mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great....\" What happens now?</span></div></div>",

Me and my partner are helping the police with this case. We were hoping we could ask some questions.\" You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it helps catch the assholes who did this, go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember much. I was sitting at the bar. I had just closed the bike shop. It was me and the other 4. The minotaur and the gorgon were talking about a potential job for the minotaur, and the succubus was flirting with the basilisk. Then I heard 5 shots. I black out after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did your senses pick up anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't see anyone and my ears were ringing from the shots. But I did smell something. It was a lilac scented perfume. No one in the bar was wearing it, so it had to be the shooters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know anyone who would want to hurt you or anyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I never met the gorgon or the basilisk. I saw the succubus in a few music videos. The minotaur was a regular, but we never talked. As for me, I don't go out much, so the only person I interact with is my wife, Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's all I got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara picks you up and takes you out into the hall. You look up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we know one thing. Whoever was shooting, they had lilac perfume.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't help much. We need more. What do you want to do now?\" Tara asks you.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps you two can persuade her to divulge the information.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a gulp and begin to shake, but then Tara squeezes you and shoves you in between her breasts as you groan and then squeezes them tight. \"Don't worry Boss, we'll get an interview out of Ms. Delilah.\" Tara takes you out as Lexi turns her head and giggles to herself. \"I can't lose. Either Tara will murder that pest, or one of the Under Gloom inmates will rip him to pieces. Prepare to die Mertins.\" Lexi lets out a roaring laugh befitting a lioness based monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara is about to walk out the front door when she looks up at the sky. She rubs the scared half of her face with anger. The scar burned the left half of her face to the point where her lips and eyelids are missing on that side. Tara doesn't want to take any chances since sunlight is fatal to her species and takes out an umbrella as she walks towards a bus stop to head for Under Gloom. \"I-I don't know about this Tara, Under Gloom is the most dangerous woman's prison in the monster world. The guards are barely better than the inmates. Aurelia's wife works there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara hisses. \"I could care less what happens to you in that prison after what you did to me you bug? If they don't eat you, I'll do it myself. Don't worry you pest. Fate's mom is the warden there. She won't harm you unless you're wearing a prison suit. But don't press your luck.\" \"Oh, well, I'm surprised you're not worried. You've got serious guts for accepting such a dangerous mission.\" Unfortunately upon hearing this, Tara blows her top and grits her fangs. \"So you think I'm fat little human?!\" \"No, I said you have guts.\" \"So you admit it! You think my belly is an oversized Thanksgiving Balloon?! How about I show you some real balloons you sausage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a gulp and soon enough Tara is on the bus with you and she has you been beneath her fat ass as you groan in pain. It takes an hour to reach Under Gloom and along the way the vampiress giantess even bounces up and down on you. She seriously didn't like you. By the time you get to the prison, you're plastered in Tara's crack and she has to peel you out. \"Next time you're dead meat.\" She warns. You make a note to keep your mouth shut as Tara walks into the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are four guards awaiting. There was a giant blue harpy resembling a snow bird complete with a beak. This was Icy and she lived up to her name as every flap of her wings created a chilling wind. Next was a monster resembling a baboon with tiger arms and legs and the tail of a snake. This was the Nue Simone. The third guard was a green elephant woman with the flap of a cobra and a snake for a nose that hissed as she trumpeted. This was Clover the Grootslang. The last of the guards was the one you heard of, Cree the werehyena, Aurelia's mate. She was naked as a jaybird, morbidly obese and had a psychotic grin on her face with her long tongue sticking out. All four guards looked really aggressive and crawled up to Tara ready to search her. Tara actually gives a concerned look as they all close in on the vampiress.</span></div></div>",

Cree growls at Clover. \"Step off hose nose, my wife has dibs on <i>that</i> human.\" \"You wanna try me furball?\" Simone just lets out a monkey like shriek. Tara is sweating and it looks like those brutes are going to strip Tara when they hear stomping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off you four! She's a reporter, not an accomplice.\" The guards step to the sides in utter fear as the warden stomps forward. You look up and see a bright blue skinned gargoyle with long pink hair and her wings wrapped around her shoulders like a cape. She was surprisingly hourglass figured considering Fate's body. This must've been Warden Destiny. \"You must be hear about Delilah,\" she says in a casual voice. \"Sorry about them. Those four are the most bloodthirsty guards I have. Sometimes I wonder why I keep such psychos employed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara follows Destiny in and you climb out from behind Tara's hair to get a good look at Destiny and Destiny finally notices you. \"You must be Tim. My Fate has told me a lot about you. How exactly does one manage to set a water cooler on fire.\" Obviously Fate warned her mom about your incompetence. \"Uh,\" you say nervously. \"I still haven't figured that out myself. Say, you know something Warden, you look a lot like...\" \"Demona,\" says Destiny in an annoyed tone. \"I know. Don't remind me, they've been making that connection since the 90s. If I get compared to a cartoon character one more time, I'm gonna blow a gasket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeesh, no wonder Fate wasn't any fun to work with. \"Like mother like daughter\" you think to yourself. \"Right this way.\" You look to a part of the prison that's not lit up. \"Hey Warden,\" you say. \"You forgot to turn on the lights in that area.\" Destiny turns to you and gives a stern look. \"That's the Dark Side. We keep the most vicious, most vile, most irredeemable wastes of monster flesh in there where they'll never see the outside again. If you wind up in there with one of those beasts, don't bother calling for help. You won't get the chance.

But look at this burn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara lifts you up and you get a front row seat to the half of her face that was charred by sunlight and you almost throw up because you can make out some exposed muscle and even some veins. \"You took away my face human, which is why I'm taking away your life!

Nobody will be surprise if one of the inmates just happened to devour you.\" \"But Tara, I don't think you're supposed to throw humans at the prisoners.

When you get to the other side, tell them Tara sent you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara squeezes you and covers your mouth with a finger to make you shake and grunt.

You were in the same cell as one of he worst criminals in the monster world and shiver. \"Warden!\" you yell. \"Destiny! There's a slight problem!\" But then you hear foot steps. This was great, you woke up whatever monster was in this cell with you.

That's who! A Frankenstein.\" Tara snapped.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Frankenstein? As OTHER PEOPLE'S plastic surgeon?!  This was so ironic you had to fight down a laugh!  \"Ok...and if things go well, we could report it to make it so they get more business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara sniffed disdainfully, but nodded stiffly as she parked. Snatching you up, Tara squeezed you and you yelped before she went into the office and up to a doctor, a  BRIDE of Frankenstein Monster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a good seven-hundred feet tall even, multiple skin tones, her eyes were two different colors, one was a blue eye and the other was purple. And she had a tall tower of black hair. She was dressed in a doctor's outfit and rubber gloves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...I take it you're my 1:00 O' Clock, then? Tara Gordon?\" she said. \"I'm Doctor Amane Sinew.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip at her last name. Sinew? This just got more and more amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara nodded. \"Yes. And what happened is obvious. I need my face evened out again to look like it ISN'T a bacon-wrapped meatball.\" Tara said, pointing at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmane nodded, then noticed you in Tara's other hand. \"Ho? And who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara growled. \"The one who broke the window and CAUSED my disfigurement! He'll be covering the bill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSAY WHAT?!   As much as you wanted to make amends for what happened to Tara, that completely blindsided you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....well, my services don't come cheap, as I'm sure you can understand. But...I think I have an idea as to an alternative way to the cost of fixing you up, Ms. Gordon...\" Dr. Sinew said thoughtfully, eyeing you in a way you didn't like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but payment upon delivery.\"  Tara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surgeon nodded and Tara followed her into her lab, setting you down on a counter, \"Careful...he's a jinx like a plague.\" the vampire said, laying on the operating table as the stitched-up woman pulled out her instruments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a lot of nipping, tucking, poking, prodding, and stitching, Tara was handed a special vampire-showing mirror and she leap to her feet cheering.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! YES! YES! Sayonara Two-Face! Tara Gordon is BACK! AH~HAHAHAH!\" Tara laughed, delighted as not a trace of what happened to her remained, it was like you had never caused that broken window accident at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whistled. Impressed.\"Damn Doc, you're pretty amazing with a scalpel, Gotta give you that!\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmane nodded. \"Yes...I am. Now...for the payment!\" she said, picking up a face mask that had a tube attaching it to a  fuel Tank of some sort and she slammed the mask over you, trapping you under it and turned a valve on the tank, causing a hissing sound to fill the mask.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was gas! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scented fumes made you dizzy and you're whole body tingled like pins and needles were all over you and you blacked out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen you wake up, your whole body hurt like you couldn't believe, and you felt...different somehow. You pushed yourself to your feet and held your head, dizzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! As much as I HATE agreeing with Tim, he was right about you with a scalpel!\" Tara cackled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you see Dr. Amane and Tara looking at you. What were they talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Frankenstein monster held a mirror in front of you and you almost blacked out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing from your back were a pair of jet-black wings with feathers that had the color of everlasting darkness, which spanned sixteen feet from wingtip to wingtip. Fully feathered like a bird's, the wings felt like they had a very flexible skeletal structure, You tried flapping them, as a bird did, and your eyes widened when they actually flapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were...you were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Fallen Angel!\" The surgeon and Tara both laughed as you looked like you were about to faint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at them and the doctor held up a needle and ran it along the underside of your feathers at the bottom of your new wings, making you wince and back away from it. Undoubtedly, they were sensitive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a masterpiece. The wings have a very flexible skeletal structure, enabling him to press them to the back of his torso and legs with only the slightest bulge visible under his clothing. His wings have superhuman strength and can create enough lift to enable him to carry aloft at least 500 pounds in addition to his own weight. Furthermore his entire anatomy is naturally adapted to flying. His bones are now highly dense bone structure, but it is also hollow like a bird's, making him weigh far less. His body is virtually devoid of fat and possesses greater proportionate muscle mass than an ordinary human does.<br>\r\nHis eyes are specially adapted to withstand high-speed winds which would hurt the average human eye. He possesses a special membrane in his respiratory system enabling him to extract oxygen from the air at high velocities or altitudes. He's able to fly by flapping his wings, as a bird does. He can reach a height of 10,000 feet with little effort. With severe strain he can reach the altitude of 29,000 feet above sea level, but he can only remain that high for several minutes. He can fly nonstop under his own power for a maximum of approximately twelve hours at the very least.<br>\r\nAnd while the normal resting heart rate for a skilled and conditioned athlete is 40 beats per minute, but his active heart rate when he's taking things easy and not trying to push himself is now 55 beats per minute...once he'll actually start to actively strain himself, it'll reached 240 beats per minute, the same as a racehorse. Furthermore, the caloric energy consumption of his body is now only 9% whereas that of normal person's would be 70%, leaving him surplus energy. Finally the results of the modification to his blood tests on him has resulted in an antibody system that is resistant to all known diseases and several poisons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear what the sewn-up woman had done to you, and you gape at her. \"WHAT?! WHY'D YOU DO THIS TO ME!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmane smiled as she leered at you. \"I wanted to prove I could. A human being completely rebuilt from the ground up with my skill as a plastic surgeon, and using MONSTER-sized surgery tools, no less? NO ONE had EVER even attempted anything like that before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara snickered \"This'll make you renowned for sure, Doc! I'll PERSONALLY see to that!\" She glared at you and held up her camera, \"Say cheese, short-stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flash blinded you for a few seconds before something like a contact lense slid over your eyes and everything suddenly looked like you were looking through sunglasses. WHAT THE HELL?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...I almost forgot! I added a darker-toned inner-eyelid membrane, keeps bright light and wind out of your eyes!\" Dr. Sinew said, sounding delighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why...?\" you asked faintly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara shrugged  \"Her changing you was the alternative payment. Wanted to prove she was THAT good at her job!\" she smirked. \"Don't expect me to like you any better since you're no longer human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt you knees give out. This...this couldn't be HAPPENING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara and Amane Sinew shook hands. \"Marvelous, Doc! I'll be recommending you quite often now!\" your coworker said.  \"If there's anything I can do for you, just say the word!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I was also wondering if you could leave him with me.\" Amane said, eyeing you. \"It'd be a shame if something ruined his new body. I'd like keeping an eye on him myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara looked at you and then back at Dr. Sinew \"Well...not sure I can do THAT, They're expecting him back at the office. And Everyone there could see your works on both of us there and put it in the news so you could EASILY end up rich before the week is out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at Tara, horrified.  Looks like until you learned to actually USE these new black wings of yours, what happened next was all up to the one who hated you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

In the back room, you see all kinds of animal parts; skins, organs and bones in jars. There are even some weird face plasters in the side of the room. The doctor was right. Your new heart really is beating faster and it's beating faster and faster as you look around your new surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shift into that inner eyelid membrane and you can see through Dr. Sinew and you wish you didn't. From the looks of it, there were wires attached to her organs in place of veins and she appeared to have two beating hearts. You knew because you could hear the beatings and you cover your ears. But that doesn't work because you could hear all kinds of sounds, from flies buzzing to the sounds in the waiting room coming from the monster patients. \"I hope Dr. Sinew can do something about these cheeks,\" says a splinter cat woman. \"Me, a splinter cat of all things getting butt implants. How embarrassing.\" \"2000 skulls for a tummy tuck?\" asks one purple haired fairy woman in a regal attire. \"Heck of a way to lose weight.\" Then you start to hear something that a male hobgoblin isn't even saying but <i>thinking</i>. \"What's taking the doc so long?\" he asks in his mind. \"The insurance company thinks I'm dead. I've got to get this face rearranged fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a scream as Dr. Sinew looks down on you. \"It seems that the auditory system I gave you needs a little fine tuning. You must be hearing all sorts of things going on at once. You continue to hold your head and you start to hear Dr. Sinew's thoughts. \"I wonder if I might have given him telepathy. I truly am a genius. If this works, I might even score a medical award. But I have to keep an eye on him. His scars are still fresh. The new skeleton I gave him needs time to settle in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're legitimately afraid and didn't know what to expect from the Frankenstein giantess. Then you hold your head and start to hear thoughts that appeared to be coming from Tara. \"The beauty queen of the Daily Tombstone is back baby, and I've gotten rid of that little pest. I hope the doctor takes his brain apart.\" You shiver and then hear more thoughts that appear to be coming from the Daily Tombstone. The first one comes from Ari, that dishonest weresheep. \"I need a good lie for the next headline. How about that aaaaautomobile company Faxanatos Enterprises. I could convince people that the engines are made from recycled heaaaarts.\" The next thought appeared to be coming from Hecate. \"Jeepers,\" thinks the wolf girl. \"Is my butt getting bigger. Mom's genes must finally be taking over.\" Then you grunt and hear some thoughts that appear to be coming from Kiki. \"I really hope Lexi doesn't realize I forgot to call that new intern she was expecting. But it's such a drag to call every single monster that wants to work here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pant and pant as your ears are burning. \"Oh dear,\" thinks Dr. Sinew. \"It appears that I have to make a few adjustments.\" Then Dr. Sinew turns her head and calls for her assistant. \"Geraldine,\" she says. \"I need you to run a few tests on our latest patient.\" In walks in a 700ft tall were boar woman. She had pinkish white skin, long reddish brown hair and four bright white tusks with pure red lips. She was very obese befitting her species with a monstrous booty and massive breasts. Geraldine was wearing a skin tight eggshell-white Totally Spies-esque unitard that was tight on her porcine body along with a nurse's hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeraldine then smiles at you. \"Certainly, Amane,\" she says as she picks up the jar with you. \"I'll run the tests on his body to see if his new organs are working the right way.\" You tap on the jar as Geraldine takes you further into the lab and Amane tends to her other patients. \"P-Please let me go,\" you say. \"My girlfriend is waiting for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeraldine lets out a squealing laugh. \"I'm afraid this is for your own good. NOBODY has ever tried something like this before. We have to make sure those wings won't make like Icarus and fall off or if your heart explodes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn pale white as your vision shifts to black again and you scream.</span></div></div>",

You're in absolute pain and from the look on her face, Geraldine is enjoying every second of it. \"I love this job.\" The pig giantess says. Geraldine then picks you up by the hair as you groan. \"Hey! Watch the hair!\" \"Sorry,\" says the boar woman. \"But we can't risk damaging your new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat actually made sense because your wounds were aching and felt like they could reopen any minute. You then start to hear Geraldine's thoughts. \"I didn't think that she'd actually be able to do it. A fallen angel's not the choice I would've chosen. I wonder what Amane would be able to do with a girl human. I keep telling Brittany that it won't hurt a bit. I do hate lying to her though. When I come home tonight, I'll ask her if she wants to become a harpy or a mermaid.\" You were now very afraid. The wereboar woman apparently had a human girl at home and was planning to subjugate her to the same horrible treatment that happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeraldine then looks down and smiles, it's a psychotic grin that is even more terrifying with those giant tusks. \"It sounds like he's reading my mind,\" she thinks to herself. \"Good. I think I might introduce you to Brittany after this. I'm sure she'll want to meet you. Providing you survive the tests.\" You shiver in your jar before you look out to see a laboratory area with what looked like a maze or obstacle course meant for lab rats. A very ironic choice of words given your choice of girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeraldine lays you down on the main table and Amane walks forward and looks down on you. You look around and see several strange machines like a treadmill of some kind and then there was a machine that looked like a smoke chamber of some time. You didn't even want to think of what that tested. \"Thanks for bringing him,\" says Amane. \"Now remember Geraldine. We need to test Tim to make sure that his body can handle his new skeleton and organs. \"New skeleton!?\" you ask in horror. Amane nodded her head. \"As your body structure was before, you needed some replacement parts in order for it to accept your new wings. But Geraldine and I are going to test you to see whether or not there are any problems or complications. But before we test your wings, we need to see how well your body is. Now, what to test first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and see Geraldine laughing wickedly at you. Exactly what do they do first?</span></div></div>",

She seems to actually consider it and Tara gives an evil smirk your way as you shiver. \"Actually, Doc,' she says with an evil thrill in her voice. \"I think I'll take him back with me to the Daily Tombstone. I want to see how his girlfriend reacts to the new him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of relief. \"Alright,\" says Dr. Sinew. \"Just try to be careful with him until his bones fully set in. Those scars are still fresh.\" Tara grabs you and then walks out as you struggle in her grip. She's sure to place you in a jar in the glove compartment so you don't cause any trouble. You couldn't believe this. How were you supposed to explain this to Mazee? You feel your wings twitching and it is driving you crazy. All your new scars are itching and it feels as though you're going to fall apart. You moan in pain and then let out a scream as your eyes kept flipping from normal to darkened iris mode. It's fitting you were turned into a fallen angel because this hurts like hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara only stops once and its to reload her car with gas. Outside, there are four male monsters including a gremlin, a phoenix and a Thetis Lake monster all ogling her and her new face as she smiles seductively. Guess she was starting to attract men again. You heard that Tara was considered the most beautiful face in the Daily Tombstone before her face was burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you grab your ears because you can hear something from several monster kilometers away. They sounded like police sirens. \"Hands in the air!\" Then you hear several gun noises and scream before you hear something else. There were moaning noises. \"Harder. Damn, it's like you're not even trying.\" You pant slightly before you hear a sound that sounded like the laugh of the Cryptkeeper. \"Make it stop!\" you yell. Your ears were being assaulted by several sounds all at once. Tara looked in amusement as you were holding your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was driving again and the sounds just didn't stop. \"You lying two-faced bitch! We've been together for ten years and then you pull this on me! And with a freakin' spriggan for the love of Ra!\" You begin to cry before you hear something else that sounds like a baby's crying. \"Congratulations. Four heads. She's gonna be a healthy hydra.\" You bang your face on the glass You wished you were death. Who knew fallen angels had such acute hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara then takes you out as she parks the car and you hear several wolf whistles at once from passersby. \"Hubba, bubba. Look at that can.\" \"Forget the can, look at that face.\" \"That girl can suck my blood any day.\" You then hear several sounds coming from inside the tower. First sounded like it was Aurelia's voice. \"I told Cree one hundred times, I want nothing to do with that damned sister of hers. I don't care if it is her parents' anniversary. I'd rather eat a bowl of spider webs than go to any town that's home to that bigoted piece of...\" You cover your ears but then you hear Beth and Fate speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fate,\" says Beth. \"Have you lost weight lately? Girl, please tell me you're only going to maintain your weight from here. I mean, there are a lot of gargoyle guys who like big girls.\" \"Fat, thin, I really don't care how I look, Beth. Mom would kill any man that comes after me anyway. Perhaps you should think about losing weight.\" \"Are you kidding?\" asks Beth. \"I'm a behemoth. I'm supposed to be fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear Yulong on the phone. \"I don't know what you're making a big deal of, James,\" says Yulong. \"Topaz is 16, I'd say she's ready to date.\" \"But Mom,\" says Yulong's son on the phone. \"Your granddaughter is dating a European dragon.\" \"James,\" says Yulong. \"I know that western dragons are... less than desirable in behavior... but George sounds like a nice guy. I didn't complain when you married Hay Lin.\" \"Mom, Hay Lin is the same type of dragon as you and me.\" You then let out a grunt before Tara takes you out of your jar and grasps you in her hand. \"Oh,\" she says. \"Let's show them the new us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara walks in and all eyes are on her and her face. Grace nearly chokes on her Chinese food at the sight and Yulong even holds down the phone. \"James,\" she says. \"I'm going to have to call you back.\" Emma squints to get a good look at Tara and then gasps. \"Tara,\" says Harley. \"You look spicy, chica.\" Harley even lets out a squeal of delight. You always knew the sow was a lesbian. \"Wow,\" says Mazee. \"Your face looks amazing, Tara.\" \"I agree mate,\" says Willa. \"It looks like how it did before Tim... burned it off.\" \"I take it the mission was a success?\" asks Lexi as she walks in.\" Tara twirls her hair and smiles. \"Mission accomplished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee then smiles nervously. \"Now, Tara,\" she says. \"I hope there's no hard feelings between you and Tim now.\" Tara gives a laugh and then unfolds her hand to show your new look. Everyone looks at you in surprise and Lexi bursts into laughter as Mazee stares in pure shock. \"Jumping dingos!\" yells Willa as her jaw drops. \"Is that Tim?\" asks Emma as she squints her eyes. \"Aye carumba,\" says Harley. \"Look at those wings.\" Grace bends over and gets a good look at your wings as she licks her lips. Blake lets out a purr. \"Now that's a canary I wouldn't mind eating up.\" Beth smiles at you as well. \"I always knew he had the face of an angel.\" Says the behemoth as she shakes her hips. \"That's a fallen angel,\" says Bea. \"Trust me, I'm a succubus. I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look nervously. \"It's not so bad having wings, Tim,\" says Fate as she holds down her own wings. \"If they get in the way, you can always fold them down into a cape.\" Cleotiti smiles nervously and even strokes you. Guess that now you're not completely human, she finds you less scary to her. Yulong is completely silent. It seems that even she can't give you any appropriate advice for this situation. Ari simply smiles at you smugly as Aurelia looks uneasily. \"I'm going to get back to work,\" she says. \"Angel food never agreed with me anyway.\" Hecate stops to draw your new form as Brandy rubs her single eye in surprise. Kiki of course couldn't care less and Anna Maria bends over to get a good look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim?\" asks Mazee as Tara hands you to her. \"Is that you.\" You smile at your girlfriend nervously. \"So how do you like the new me, Baby?\"</span></div></div>",

You grin and fall back onto Tara's palm in relief. \"Did you think I wouldn't like the new you?\" she asks as she pets your head. \"I don't know, maybe? Its kind of a big change.\" you tell her. \"I wouldn't say that. You look like the same old Tim. You just have wings now.\" she says reassuringly. \"I wouldn't say he's exactly the same.\" Tara says with a laugh. Mazee tilts her head so you explain. \"I apparently have better senses now.\" you explain. \"On the way hear my hearing was out of control and I was getting blasted from all directions.\" Your girlfriend gives you a sympathetic look and goes to pick you up. As she does her fingers accidentally grab a part of a wing and you wince. \"Ahh!\" you exclaim, causing her to pull back. \"Sorry!\" she cries. \"Its okay, they're just sensitive because they're new. The doctor said they'll set in a couple of days.\" Tara says. \"The doctor?\" Mazee asks. The vampire shrugs. \"Yeah about that...she fixed my face free of charge in exchange for experimenting on Tim. \"You used him as a guinea pig?!\"Mazee says. \"I'd say he's more of a bird than a pig.\" Tara jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the commotion dies down everyone disperses leaving just you, Mazee, and Tara. Mazee picks you up, being careful of your wings this time, and places you in her paw. \"Well, I guess this makes us even.' Tara says. \"Maybe being an angel will cure his bad luck.\" She then walks away, leaving you with your girlfriend. \"Are you sure you're okay with this?\" you ask her. Mazee kisses your head. \"Of course, I love you.\" she says. \"Thanks, I don't know what I would do without you.\" you tell her. Suddenly a shadow appears over you as someone stands next to Mazee.\"You could always come to me Timmy.\" they say. You look up and see that its Blake. \"Not now Blake, he's been through a lot.\" Mazee says annoyed. The weretiger shrugs and walks away. Its weird though, while she was there you felt strangely aroused. You don't know what to make of this but the feeling went away when she left. As Mazee walks toward her desk she passes Kiki, who is dozing off. When she approaches the tanuki you feel yourself getting drowsy. When Mazee reaches her desk she looks down and sees you dozing off. \"Tim?\" she asks as she prods you with a finger. You snap to attention and shake your head. \"Whats wrong?\" she asks concerned. Deciding that this could become a problem you explain these strange feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the feelings just went away?\" Mazee asks when you finish talking. You nod and she scratches her head. \"Maybe we should ask someone for help. The first choice is Yulong, since she's the wisest monster you know. Once the two of you explain things to her she scratches her chin. \"From what you're telling me it sounds like its related to the seven deadly sins.\" she suggests. \"Particularly lust and sloth.\" You and Mazee listen intently. \"You say it happened near certain monsters?\" she asks. \"Yeah, when Blake was flirting with me and when Kiki was...being Kiki.\" you tell her. The dragon ponders a bit more before speaking. \"Well a human becoming a fallen angel has never been done before, so maybe this is a side effect. Being a fallen angel could be making you sensitive to those who exhibit the seven sins.\" she says. \"Meaning?\" Mazee says. \"Meaning that if someone displays a sin it could make Tim feel it as well.\" the dragon finishes. \"But thats just a guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that crazy doctor even manage this?\" Mazee asks. \"Beats me, I was out like a light.\" you tell her. \"Still, it is quite impressive.\" Yulong says. \"Well thats what the doc was going for.\" you say. \"Don't worry, we can get through this.\" Mazee says.</span></div></div>",

I'll think of something.\" You gulp because you really hope that Mazee is right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you and Mazee are at the door of Mazee's apartment building. At the front desk is Mazee's landlady, Cynthia. Cynthia was a giant pear-shaped lich woman who dressed in a purple outfit with a cape, shorts and knee-high high heels. Being a lich her body was decayed and the lower have of her face had her jawbone exposed and you could see her ribs from a hole in her large belly. Surprisingly she had purple horns at the sides of her head and her long purplish black hair. Cynthia turned her decayed head to see you and Mazee and looked in surprise the moment you laid her eye on her (one of her eyes fell out a long time ago).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mazee?\" she asks. \"Is that, Tim?\" Mazee nods her head and you can hear Cynthia's thoughts. \"I don't even want to know what happened to him? If Roger came home with wings like that, I'd kill him.\" Roger was Cynthia's human husband. Part of the reason the lich tolerated Mazee having a human boyfriend was her own interspecies relationship. Although, you had doubts about Roger's loyalty to Cynthia. Cynthia then turns her head the other way. \"Carry on, Mazee,\" she says. \"Oh, and don't forget, rent's due on Friday. Mazee nodded her head because she understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee walks up the stairs to her apartment and along the way, you pass several monsters. One was a male landshark resembling a red cookie cutter shark and you read his thoughts. \"That blackout was just what I needed. The security cam short-circuited, 10,000 skulls. If anyone asks, I'll say it was a bank robbery.\" From what you heard, that landshark worked at a bank and had embezzled a lot of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim,\" says Mazee. \"I'm thinking about ordering pizza. What would you like?\" \"Oh,\" you say. \"Nothing much. Just olives, mushrooms, chili peppers, anchovies, onions...\" You stop yourself and realize that you're being greedy, no doubt from reading that greedy thought. Mazee then turns her head. \"I wonder if Tim can read minds in his new condition?\" \"Yes,\" you say. \"I can.\" Then you gasp and Mazee gives a look of surprise. \"Well there goes my privacy.\" The were rat giantess thinks sarcastically to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mazee reaches her apartment door, you see one of her neighbors trying to unlock the front door. This neighbor was a giant black skinned and red spotted were giraffe woman with a pear shaped figure and long reddish blonde hair. She also appeared to be naked From the looks of it she was trying to unlock her front door. \"Hi Melba.\" Says Mazee as she unlocks her own door. You listen in to the giraffe woman's thoughts and they worry you. \"Hi Melba yourself, Mazee. If she only knew what I did to that jerk at the diner this morning, she wouldn't be so friendly. I didn't even get a good price for the bones.\" You're beginning to wonder exactly how well you know the people in Mazee's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mazee is in her apartment, she lays you down on the coffee table before she dials the phone to order her pizza. Once you're on the table, you nibble at a giant M&amp;M from Mazee's candy dish but then you hear thoughts that further disturb you. \"Harder Roger, harder. Rowr. Take it in deeper.\" \"Oh man, Cynthia would kill me if she knew what I was doing, but how can I resist this nice piece of feline beauty.\" Then you grunt and hold your head. \"I don't know what she's worried about. It's the perfect crime. We pay off our debts and collect on the life insurance policy only I don't have to die. It's a good thing I know the coroner pretty well.\" You grunt before you hear another thought that makes you even more nervous. \"It ends tonight. I'll avenge you Ursula. It busts my balls that a spriggan of all creatures is running for mayor. A spriggan's just an ugly fairy and tomorrow night, he dies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a scream and Mazee looks at you nervously. \"I hope some pizza calms him down,\" says Mazee. \"Hello, Quba's Pizzeria?\" You then read Mazee's mind. \"The new art critic we hired told me about the man who runs this pizzeria. Apparently he was a failed artist but he still insists he's the best artist in the world. If he was, he wouldn't be selling pizza. Be careful now Mazee, Tim can read your mind, don't think about anything, especially don't think about how you've been wearing the same pair of panties for sixth months straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally gag and so does Mazee who then looks at you in annoyance. \"I hope you're happy you deeming Tim.\" She grumbles in her mind. \"Not even.\" You say.</span></div></div>",

You don't know if it will be easy since you keep hearing the thoughts of Mazee's neighbors. The last couple of hours you've been focusing on tuning it out, but some of it still slips through. One other good thing is that you feel like your new body is almost settled in. Doctor Sinew said it would take about a day and its been over half a day since then. After Mazee takes a shower she carefully cleans you in the bathroom sink, being extra careful with your wings. They actually don't hurt that much. As she carries you to the bed you look at the pile of dirty laundry she has. \"I gotta get that laundry done tomorrow.\" you hear her think embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wererat lies down and places you on her giant furry belly. \"Ready for some shut eye?\" she asks. \"I kinda wanted to have some fun.\" you tell her. She tilts her head nervously. \"Are you up for  that?\" she asks, but you can tell she's a little excited. You're getting more anxious, which means she's giving off some lust. \"I think I am you sinner.\" you say with a grin. She blinks and then grins back at you. \"Well lets get to it my little angel.' she says, and you undress yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way up her stomach and climb her breast when you reach it. Maze giggles at the feeling and when you reach the top you head straight for her nipple. Fueled by lust you attack it and squeeze it with all your might. Mazee gasps and jumps a little. \"Oh! Eager aren't you?\" she asks. You stare up at her and grin. \"Its your fault Miss Lustful.\" you respond, then start biting it. After a little more of this Mazee picks you up and moves you down her body. \"Time for the main event.\" she says, filling you with even more lust. She drops you between her legs and you are hit with her feminine aroma. Without a second thought you rush forward and into her vagina. Luckily there's enough space for your wings. Mazee bucks and moans outside while you nibble and massage the walls inside. In a fit of pleasure you climax inside her first, your wings flapping as you do. Shortly after a flood of juices washes you out as Mazee finishes as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie between your girlfriend's thighs panting and she lies back in bed. \"That was amazing.\" she says, panting as well.

One of your neighbors is a bank robber and I'm pretty sure one of them is a murderer.\" Mazee gives a worried look. \"I hope Dr. Sinew can do something about that.

Your eyes then open up and you stare at Mazee and imagine a fantasy too deviant to write down. \"Help,\" you mutter. \"Help.\" Mazee notices you staring in lust and then holding your head and then your rodent girlfriend gives a disturbed look. \"On second thought, perhaps we should see Dr. Sinew before we head to work.\" The light turns and Mazee goes left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the Daily Tombstone, Beth and Blake are devouring a box of donuts as they thought up a plan. \"What if Tim was something unattractive to that dirty rat?\" asks Blake. Beth shoves three donuts into her hippopotamus-like mouth before staring at the tigress. \"What do you mean?\" Blake gives a smirk as she licks up some milk. \"You saw what that mad doctor did to Tim. She turned a human into a miniature fallen angel. If she can turn Tim into a human-looking monster, why not turn him into a bestial monster?\" Beth gave a snort. \"You thinking that he'd look good as a behemoth or a were tiger?\" \"No you pachydermic fool,\" says Blake. \"What if Dr. Sinew can convert Tim into a weresnake? Mazee is deathly afraid of snakes. She'd dump him in a heartbeat.\" Beth lets out a laugh. \"Oh yes,\" she says. \"That will work.\" Blake then takes out her cellphone (where she'd keep it when she never wears clothes, don't ask) and begins to dial. \"Good thing that I got that quack's number from Tara. This is going to be sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Mazee had brought you to see Dr. Sinew. \"Aha,\" says the mad Frankenstein woman. \"So you're Tim's girlfriend. I wasn't expecting him to be a rat person.\" Mazee rolls her eyes. \"I am really sick of other monsters treating my species like vermin. Listen, could you try to adjust his telepathy? It\u2019s driving him crazy.\u201d \u201cAlright, Ms. Robinson.\u201d Dr. Sinew takes you into the next room and you give a gulp. \u201cI really hope that this doesn\u2019t hurt as bad as last time.\u201d You think. Dr. Sinew lets out a laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Everything will...\u201d Before the doctor could finish her sentence, the phone suddenly rings. \u201cOh,\u201d said Dr. Sinew. \u201cYou just stay there. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Dr. Sinew walks up to the phone to answer it. \u201cYes,\u201d she asks. \u201cYes. Oh, I see. Very interesting proposal, Ms. Williams.\u201d Ms. Williams? That couldn\u2019t be Blake could it? Oh, what are you worried about. Williams is a very common last name, it couldn\u2019t be anything serious. Could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmane then hangs up the phone and then gives a smirk as she turns to you and gets out her tools. \u201cChange of plans.\u201d She says. You see Amane coming with her tools and let out a scream before she goes to work on you. In the waiting room, Mazee hears your screaming and is very worried. \u201cTim!\u201d she yells. \u201cWhat are they doing to you in there! Tim!\u201d You continue to groan as your wings are removed and then she gets to work on your arms and legs as you scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Dr. Sinew comes out and Maggie is worried sick. \u201cWhat did you do with my boyfriend, you quack!?\u201d yells your rodent girlfriend. Dr. Sinew gave a laugh. \u201cWell, since he didn\u2019t entirely like being a falling angel, I had something else in mind. Look.\u201d You let out a groan and Dr. Sinew opens her hands as Mazee looks in pure fear and even screams. You had been turned into a long red-skinned weresnake, specifically a gaboon viper with arms and legs that ended in claws. You were horrified yourself knowing that Mazee had a fear of snakes due to her rodent features. \u201cMazee,\u201d you say weakly. \u201cIt\u2019s still me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you and Mazee exit her apartment she's locking the door when you hear the sound of someone coming down the stairs. Her footsteps are very rapid and you see its because she has eight legs. Its a 900 foot dridder with the lower body of a mouse spider, while her upper body is that of a woman with red skin and huge breasts. She's got orange hair that reaches down to her back and is wearing a low cut shirt with a leather jacket. \"Hey Mazee.\" the dridder says, giving your girlfriend a slap on the back. \"Oh, hey Jane.\" Mazee says. \"What are you up to?\" Jane gives her a smile. \"Oh nothing, just heading out to take care of some business.\" The dridder seems innocent but then you hear her inner thoughts. <i>Oh I'll take care of it all right. That no good spriggan is going down!</i> Suddenly you realize that you've heard her thoughts before. She was one of the neighbors you heard through the walls yesterday! <i>If that lousy fairy freak thinks she'll become governor I'll just have to teach her otherwise! Its what Ursula would want.</i> You keep your mouth shut to avoid causing any trouble. With those wrathful thoughts coming out of her you might say something you regret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane sees you peeking at her from Mazee's shoulder and leans in for a better look. \"Is this your boyfriend? I though he was a human.\" she says. \"He's been through some things. He's a fallen angel now.\" she explains and holds you out. Jane offers a finger and you shake it with a smile. <i>Huh, guess I won't be having him for a snack. Still, its better than her having a fairy for a lover. They'd have to disappear.</i> You stare at her as these thoughts run through her head. She notices and tilts her head. <i>Whats with that look? The little guy's acting like he can read my mind.</i> When you turn your head away at this her eyes widen. \"Well I'll get going now. See you two later!\" the spider woman says. She heads off down the stairs and leaves the two of you alone. You want to tell Mazee about her plans but want to wait. That girl seems dangerous and you don't want her over hearing you. Mazee starts down the stairs to leave for work while you worry about her neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reaches the bottom of the stairs a hand appears from behind her and forces a cloth into Mazee's face. After one breath she goes unconscious and falls forward. She lands on the ground with a resounding crash and you go flying off of her shoulder. Instead of hitting the floor though you land on your back on some soft sticky surface. Looking up you see Jane hanging from the ceiling by a string of web. You also notice that you're stuck on a spiderweb. Jane comes down and plucks you from the web. \"Alright little guy, I know you know whats going on.\" she says. \"I don't know what you're talking about! What did you do to Mazee?\" you exclaim, feigning ignorance. \"Don't worry, she's just out for a little while because of my venom.\" the dridder says, giving you a smile that flashes her fangs. \"If I don't want to leave bite marks I can extract it from my fangs and use it later.\" She holds up the venom covered cloth. \"Now I can't have you blowing my cover, so I'll be taking you with me.\" she says. She stuffs you inside her cleavage and exits the building after propping Mazee against the wall. \"If you behave I might just return you to your girlfriend.\" she tells you. \"Your little ability could come in handy, so you're going to help me.\" What does she have in mind?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jane walks down the street and eventually starts taking a lot of twists and turns in her path. After a while she pulls you out of her cleavage. \"Okay, you're going to help me bust my friend out of jail.\" she says bluntly. \"What?!\" you blurt out. What the hell is she thinking? \"My friend Ursula is locked up in Under Gloom. With you I'm going to find a way to get her out.\" This is bad! Ursula is bad news. You know because the paper did a story on her. She's a werebear that hates all fairies and monsters like them. She was thrown into Under Gloom for inciting a riot against the now governor fairy. Jane must be one of her supporters. She no doubt took part in the riot. \"How the hell am I supposed to do that?!\" you ask frantically. \"Look, I don't know the details, but I know you're some kind of telepath. With that power and your size you can sneak around that place without getting caught.\" Before you can offer a rebuttal she stuffs you back into her boobs and takes off walking again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you are taken out and are once again face to face with Jane. \"Okay, here we are.\" she says, pointing to a building in the distance. \"Why are we so far away?\" you ask. \"You're one thing, but if I get too close to that place someone will notice, so you're going it alone from here.\" she explains. \"You can't expect me to actually pull this off!\" you cry. Suddenly she frowns and you find yourself being wrapped up in a cocoon of web. \"Listen here, if you don't at least try you'll never see you're girlfriend again!\" she spits out, baring her fangs. The anger in her voice suddenly hits you and you respond before you can think. \"Maybe she shouldn't have gotten caught in the first place! Why should I break her furry ass out of a jail she belongs in?!\" you shout, then you immediately clamp your mouth shut. Jane's eye twitches and she bares her fangs once again. This time however you can see poison dripping from them. \"Wait! I didn't mean that!\" you cry out. The dridder narrows her eyes as you desperately explain. \"I don't know why, but I pick up on people's sins! Your wrath made me angry too!\" Jane's expression suddenly changes and she laughs. \"Thats quite a problem you have! It must be making things hard for Mazee!\" she says. You sigh, as the mood calms down and decide you have no choice but to go along with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you fly into the prison and make your way to Urusula'a cell.\" Jane says, holding you in her palm. \"She's probably where they keep the worst prisoners, so look around a little.\" You look up at her like she's crazy but she just puts a finger to your lips. \"You're practically a bug to them. They won't even pay you any mind if you're buzzing around.\" she says, trying to reassure you. Suddenly you realize there's a way out of this. You can just find the warden and she'll help you! You've heard the warden of Under Gloom is a bit on the angry side, but she's a good person. As if reading your mind Jane presses a finger to your face. \"And if you get any funny ideas, remember this. The warden may help you, but the guards of Under Gloom aren't so helpful. If you run into one of them there's no telling what they'll do. You should just get Ursula out of her cell. She should know what to do after that, and we'll even let you get home to Mazee.\" she says with a smirk. With that she tosses you through the air towards the prison. You flap your wings as best as you can to get some height, but you're still new at it so your flying is pretty wobbly. Eventually you steady yourself a bit and get closer to the massive building. Part of you is forgetting this awful situation and is amazed that you're actually flying. Upon entering a window however you start to get tired and begin losing altitude. You hit the floor and roll a little before coming to a stop. Now that you're here you need to figure out what to do. Jane may have been lying about the guards but should you take that risk? Maybe your wings will make them see you as a monster instead of a human and they'll be more willing to help. You could even luck out and find the warden! As you ponder for a moment the ground starts shaking and a shadow falls upon you. You hear a woman's thoughts enter your head as you stare up at....</span></div></div>",

Somehow you manage to get caught between the toes of this giantess and not get completely crushed. As you struggle to get free you notice that the fur of this paw is yellow. Your situation really makes you feel like a bug thats been stepped on. The giantess takes a step forward and you feel yourself rising with her paw. Her thoughts suddenly fill your head. \"Patrolling sucks! I should be the one in charge instead of that big blue jerk!\" You don't know what kind of monster this woman is but you can see that her fur is yellow. You're also starting to feel the effects of her emotions. \"Why am I even here?\" you say to yourself as you get carried by the moving paw. \"I'm supposed to find some criminal bear. Why doesn't anyone try to rescue me?\" You start feeling envy coming from the giantess and are pouting as you think about what you don't have. \"She gets a friend trying to break her out of jail and I get kidnapped just because I'm small!\" you rant. The next step the monster takes snaps you out it and you try harder to escape. Miraculously you barely squeeze free and roll onto the floor as she walks away. Looking up you see her from behind as she exits. She seems to be a lion, but there's a stinger on her tail swinging around. She must be a manticore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know if you should try and get her attention. She seemed kinda bitter from what her thoughts were saying. It seems like she wants a promotion though, so maybe she would help you! Deciding to risk it, you slowly start to flap your wings. This is the first time you've tried taking off by yourself, so its a bit challenging. Once you're sufficiently up in the air you take off toward the manticore. You see her big yellow behind round a corner, her tail almost waving goodbye. You prepare to turn when suddenly someone else comes around the corner. You fly headfirst into a soft wall and bounce backward in the air. You begin falling and have to flap extra hard to stay airborne. When you steady yourself you see what you ran into. She's a massive onryo, and from her uniform you can tell she works at the prison. The thing that draws your attention is her breasts, which is also the wall you flew into. They're huge, even by monster standards! Its amazing that her uniform can actually hide them. It must be custom fit. You figure she probably has LOS or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some effort you fly forward, intent on making to someone who can help. Veering off to side you manage to avoid the onryo, barely skirting by her breasts. When you round the corner you can see the manticore off in the distance. You don't know if you should keep following her deeper into the prison. That seems like it could be more dangerous than helpful. You could run into some guard who might give you trouble or even end up in one of the cells. After briefly considering going back and trying to get the onryo's attention you hear a booming noise from behind you. You realize its getting closer and turn to see the onryo walking toward you!. Her insanely huge boobs are bouncing as she walks, looming ever closer with each step. At this point those wrecking balls could knock you out of the sky again. You consider trying to reach her face, but are afraid those mammaries will block any attempts with their bouncing. After a moment of contemplation you start flying away from her. If you can at least out some distance between you and her you can rethink your options. Unfortunately the infinitely larger woman is closing in fast thanks to her size. Do you get away or do her boobs reach you first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you begin to get tired a final flap grants you a burst of speed, propelling you forward. The onryo following you happens to turn a corner, her boobs narrowly missing you as she does so. When you look back to see the planet sized destroyers are no longer a threat you sigh in relief. Unfortunately all that flying has worn you out and your wings are feeling like they're going to fall off. Carefully you slow your flapping and descend to the ground, hoping for a soft landing. They give out too soon though, and you end up falling about ten feet, rolling onto your stomach. At least it didn't hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up you dust yourself off and look at your surroundings. There are gigantic cells all around you. Not surprising, seeing as this is a prison. You begin to walk along the empty hall peering into the cells when the ground begins rumbling, signaling the coming of another guard. You scramble to find somewhere to hide, cursing your luck. As the monster approaches you feel some wrath flowing into you and curse even more under your breath. \"Why the fuck can't I just get a break today!?\" you whisper to yourself, running to one of the cells. You slip between the bars just as a huge paw lands outside the cell. Looking up you see an 800 foot werehyena, hands on her hips and wearing a mean smile. She's also completely nude, but her fur pretty much covers her. \"How we doing Ariel?\" she asks mockingly. Yet another rumble sounds right behind you as someone walks up to the cell. Two of the standard issue prison shoes land on either side of you and you look up to see that they're being worn by a yellow-green skinned gremlin girl. \"Just peachy Cree.\" the gremlin answers sarcastically. \"Don't you have anything better to do than torment us?\" Cree just laughs, her tongue sticking out. \"Like you criminals deserve better! I'm just doing my job and checking up on you.\" She looks down on the smaller woman condescendingly and reaches into the cell. She flicks Ariel's nose with her claw and walks away, laughing to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel rubs her nose and turns to go back to her bunk. You can hear her grumbling, feeding more wrath into you with her anger at Cree. \"I hope I don't run into that lousy mutt, she seems like a real bitch.\" you mutter angrily. After Ariel plops herself down on the bed you decide to exit the cell and try to find your target. Ursula has to be around here somewhere, but where? She's a pretty serious criminal, so you'd think she would be where they keep the worst ones. The area you're in now looks like a pretty normal row of cells. You could just check the rest of these, but you could also head down another hall and try to find some more prisoners. You'd better decide fast. You don't want to stay standing still for too long with these guards appearing at random. </span></div></div>",

You look up at each cell and see the various criminals locked up. One holds a white skinned orc who is pacing back and forth with her arms crossed like she's thinking. You get a flash of pride as you hear her thoughts. \"This next one should work if I can get the ingredients. I'm a great sorceress, I can get out of here!\" Further down you see a muscular chesire cat doing sit ups. She seems to have some kind of collar on. \"Oh I can't wait until i see my Wade again!\" she thinks, throwing of some lust at you. You have to rush past this one, or you might end up trying to go to her filled with lust. One cell that grabs your attention is one that has no bars. Rather, it seems more like glass. You walk closer to it and see a woman floating around inside made of some kind of green gas. Guess the cell was made to keep her in specifically. You don't actually hear anything from her, but a small feeling of sloth is hanging around her. There's also a kitsune who has massive breasts in one cell. They're not as big as the planet destroyers on that onryo though. This girl seems to be having pleasant thoughts, but you can feel a little greed in each one. Yes, it seems this prison has quite a colorful set of inmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually in your trek you reach a cross section and have to decide where to go. One path leads to a set of stairs, while the other leads to a darker hallway. For once your new powers come in handy and you sense much more powerful sins coming from the darker path. You figure thats where Ursula is and head that way. As you walk you lament the fact that you're in a situation where finding a convict is useful. The further you go down the hall the darker it gets. Every now and then one of the guards will walk by, but you're so small they don't pay you any mind. You just need to avoid getting squished. When you finally reach the cells you can feel the sins around you. The air is thick with it. This place doesn't have normal lighting like the rest of the prison either. There are lamps hanging from the ceiling, making it seem much darker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new area is unlike the others. Just standing here is making your head swirl with different thoughts and emotions. \"Man what I wouldn't give to just get laid.\" one voice says. \"When I get this damn muzzle off, someone's becoming my lunch.\" another sounds. You walk further into the hall, wary of getting too close to the cells. If these prisoners are as bad as the auras they're giving off, they might just snatch you up. \"Why the fuck do I even have to do this?!\" you think, catching some of the abundant wrath going around. \"I just wish I could go home to Mazee. I'd love to have some of that rat booty right now.\" Lust takes over for a second. As the sins around you mess your head you decide to get looking, but how will you find Ursula?</span></div></div>",

You're waiting nervously as Mazee returns with a plate of tacos and nachos smothered in cheese. You pick at one of the nacho chips and bite into it as you're still worried. \"Tim,\" says Mazee. \"Don't get yourself worked up. We'll get through this.\" \"I hope so,\" you say. \"I feed off of sins now. Today I felt the sins of sloth and lust. The latter worries me.\" Mazee just bites into a taco herself. As you and your rodent girlfriend are eating, something comes over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace walks by carrying a plate that had at least seventeen cheeseburgers on it. You have no idea where that pear-shaped cheetah kept it all, but she was definitely qualified for her job as a food critic. As Grace plops down on the table across from you and Mazee, you feel your stomach in pain and start to ravenously pull the meat out of the taco in Mazee's hand and shovel in into your mouth. You were suddenly very hungry and eat the taco so fast you accidentally bite Mazee. \"Ouch!\" You gasp. \"I'm sorry, Mazee,\" you say. \"But I'm starving! I need more tacos. Please?\" Mazee notices Grace eating like Garfield and realizes something. You were feeling another sin; gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait right here,\" says Mazee. \"I'll be right back.\" \"Hurry!\" you yell as you bite into a nacho even bigger than yourself. You groan as you get so out of control with hunger that you even bite into Mazee's napkin and begin to cry. As you're chewing the napkin, you hear Grace's thoughts. \"I wonder how Tim would taste in one of these cheeseburgers. A fallen angel, I'll bet he tastes spicy. Looking at those succulent wings. I'm definitely going to eat him one of these days. I'll just wait for him to lower his guard and when Mazee's not there to protect him... chomp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really hope those wings set in just in case those burgers don't fully satisfy the cheetah's monstrous hunger. As you're wondering what to do, something else comes over you, it was Bea Zebub, the succubus intern. You gag and find yourself staring at her heart shaped butt and her devil's tail as she bends over and adjusts her fishnet stockings. You're actually drooling and you have to cover your mouth as you begin to cry. You can even hear Bea's thoughts as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye carumba,\" says Bea. \"I can't believe he's still trapped in there. I gotta start looking for bigger men. I can still feel him walking around in my tunnel trying to get out. That's gotta be the third human this year that's gotten stuck in there.\" You shiver and fold your wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly you grunt and grit your teeth. \"What is taking that rat bitch so long?!\" Then you gasp. \"Oh no! Did I just call Mazee a bitch!? This is all that stupid doctor's fault! And that damn Tara. Next time I'm going to mess her face up on...?!\" Where was all that rage coming from? Lexi passes by and you can hear her thoughts as well. \"That surgery is bound to come apart,\" she thinks to herself. \"And I'll be glad when his scars open up and he falls right apart. I hope that little parasite suffers every second of it.\" Lexi was no doubt speaking about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst your better judgement, you're forced to retaliate. \"Oh yeah!?\" you yell. \"I don't need to take that kind of guff from somebody who uses a sandbox as a toilet!\" Then you cover your mouth as Lexi turns her head. Horrifyingly, she isn't angry but smiling malicious. \"Screw you.\" You say in both fear and anger. \"Oh no,\" says Lexi with a grin. \"Screw you.\" The sphinx laughs wickedly and then leaves. You're still chewing on the napkin when Mazee returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took you so long!\" you yell. \"I'm starving you bloated...!\" \"Tim!\" yells Mazee. \"That's just Grace's gluttony and Lexi's wrath talking.\" You let out a moan and then you grunt. \"Lexi's always on my case but never on yours,\" you say. \"It's not fair. Kiki, Ari and Anna-Maria area all worse employees than me but she always picks on me.\" Why were you saying it, where was that jealousy coming from. Then you hear thoughts and you turn to see Beth hiding in the corner. \"Look at her with her newly transformed boyfriend. Fallen angel. He should be with me, I'm one of the demon beasts. He's a chubby chaser and I have the biggest ass of any monster girl in here. That rat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Beth is ranting and giving you her jealousy, Mazee looks in horror because you can't help but stare at Grace's huge butt as she gets up and takes her empty tray away. \"Meow.\" You say. Mazee looks in shock at what you said and you're in just as much shock and even begin to cry. \"I'm sorry,\" you say. \"I can't help it if.... Blake has some HUGE gazongas.\" You cover your mouth and then look forward to see that Blake was at the next table and she was smiling seductively as she licked a banana. \"Go ahead little man,\" thinks the tigress to herself. \"I'm all yours.\" You scram and then grab your head as Mazee looks on in worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Beth see you like this and then both of them get a fiendish idea. As Mazee takes you and rushes away, Beth walks up and sits next to Blake, albeit requiring three chairs to hold her large ass. \"He is going absolutely out of control with sin,\" says Beth. \"Especially lust. I wonder if he heard our thoughts.\" \"He definitely did,\" says Blake. \"If this keeps up, Mazee might even break up with him.\" \"Then let's milk this for all it's worth,\" says Beth as she shows her hippo-like fangs. \"We'll aggravate his lust so bad he'll have no choice but to choose one of us.\" The tigress purrs as she shakes hands with Beth and both monsters form a diabolical plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Mazee has you back at her cubicle and you're shivering. Beth and Blake see this and smile at each other. \"Commence Operation Fetish Fuel,\" says Blake. \"Get your sexy on, Beth. We're going to have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which one of them strikes first?</span></div></div>",

She's one of the few people you can say that you hate. Ari fabricated news stories and spread lies regarding the subjects she was dispatched to deal with. You're afraid one of these days it would case somebody to sue the Daily Tombstone.You're about to speak to Lexi but then you stop yourself. Ari warned you if you told Lexi about what she was doing she'd eat you. \"Uh nothing boss. No problem.\" You gulp and take out your camera to rub it. Sometimes you dreaded being a photographer at this newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to walk away as Lexi gives a confused look. She then shrugs her shoulders. \"As long as that human isn't in my office, I don't care.\" You reach the cubicle area and gulp as you approach Ari. At that moment, that fat red wooled weresheep was working at her laptop before she notices you and glares at you. \"So,\" she says. \"You're working with me todaaaaay slaaaave.\" She rolled her As, very common for a sheep based monster. \"Staaaaart rubbing.\" Ari puts both of her hooves in front of you and gives you a glare. You see her biting into what appears to be a human shape covered in chocolate and then shiver as you start rubbing the soles of her hooves. You hated working for that slavedriver of a sheep, but you had no choice but to do what she said lest you wind up in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes, you stop the massage and Ari looks down at her feet. \"Not baaaad,\" she bleats. \"But I expect better in the future you little baaaastard.\" Ari then lifts you up and then holds you by the leg in front of her face. \"Ari.\" You moan. Ari squeezes your leg and makes you yell before she gets up and places you in her chair and sits on you. It's not enough to squish you but you're still in pain from being sat on in the first place. To really make it painful, Ari wiggles her large woolly butt to grin you. \"That's Goddess Ari worm. Don't ever forget that. The only thing humaaaaans are good for is slaaaave laaaabor. If only the others like Maaaazee and Willaaaaa understood that. Come on bug, we're going on a report.\" Ari gets up with you plastered between her cheeks. You really didn't like how condescending she was towards you, but what could you do? She was more than one hundred times bigger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAri is walking out the front door when you speak to her. \"A... er Goddess Ari, you're not gonna fabricate this story like when you told everyone that movie theater was built on a Grootslang graveyard are you?\" Ari lets out a scoff. \"If I'm gonna staaaaay top reporter, I've got to make things interesting. Faaaaacts will only get in the waaaaay.\" \"But if Lexi finds out, you'll be fired.\" \"She isn't gonna find out and if you taaaattle on me, you'll be in my belly.\" You gulp before Ari squeezes you out of her cheeks and into her hand before placing you in her ear. \"While you're up there,' she says. 'Clean out my earwaaaaaax.\" You stick out a tongue and reluctantly start picking the weresheep's ear cavity and cleaning out a sea of yellow wax. \"So Goddess Ari. What's our mission today?\"</span></div></div>",

You sigh and start pulling at a big lint ball while Ari leaves the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\nIt was only an hour to Fearfield General Hospital, but for you, it felt like an eternity. After you were done pulling out her belly button lint, Ari made you floss her teeth. You swore you saw bones in there.

Hopefully, she wouldn't work you like a dog while on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you entered the hospital lobby. There, you saw a male werewolf walk up to you.

Once inside, he shows you a patient. The patient was an overweight female werecat. She looks upset, but otherwise healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAri was confused. \"Whaaaaats wrong with her? She looks like aaaaaany other werecaaaaat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just it.\" Dr. Kaufmann replies. \"Yesterday, she wasn't a werecat. She was human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Ari both gasp. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Dr. Kaufmann replies. \"Poor Carla here was just a normal, skinny human. Then, out of the blue, she suddenly turned into a fat werecat. She came here and we ran some tests. We've managed to isolate some symptoms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And those are?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Kaufmann grabs a clipboard and flips through it. \"The major symptom seem to be a total species conversion, but other symptoms are high weight gain, temporary blindness in the right eye, moderate deafness, moderate coughing, mild sneezing, and mild vomiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that sounds baaaaad.\" Ari says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't been able to isolate a cure yet, but we have discovered something in the hour before you got here.

You liked her. Yulong never showed any hostile attitude towards you other than mild annoyance when compared to western dragons. Yulong was the wisest monster you\u2019ve ever met and she didn\u2019t hold you responsible for the accidents you caused, even when one of them put her in the hospital. You don\u2019t know how old she is but you think that she\u2019s probably older than Lexi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother was the nicest monster in the building, Cleotiti the mummy. She was hired to write a fashion column for girl monsters and also had several tips for home improvement and style. She couldn\u2019t even be compared to her twin sister who you heard was the meanest mummy in the world. But Cleotiti had a bad experience with a mean human who left her so traumatized that seeing a human would send her into a blind panic no matter how nice she was and she even tried to stomp on you at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne other monster that was unintentionally harmful to you was Emma the polar werebear. On the plus side, the ursine giantess got you front row seats to the monster sports like football and hockey, but she was not careful when it came to you and sometimes you fell too close to the action. Also because she forgets how tiny you are and how big she is and doesn\u2019t wear glasses like she should, Emma unintentionally endangers you. Last time you worked with her, she mistook you for a piece of chewing gum and you were stuck in her mouth trying to avoid getting crushed by her titanic teeth before you were tangled in the gum already in her mouth and stuck to the underside of a table. You were lucky given how she usually swallows her gum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was a monster malicious and friendly at the same time oddly enough. That nudist weretiger entertainment critic Blake. She didn\u2019t accept you had a girlfriend and was always asking you when you and Mazee were going to break up so she could have you herself. That flirting feline was ought to get you by hook or by crook. One time she even put you in a cage and you had to stay at her apartment for three days. You were afraid to work with her because Mazee would kill you if you cheated on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the monster you feared the most, that pear shaped werecheetah food critic Grace. Grace was perhaps the greatest culinary critic in the monster world and a review from her could be a blessing or a curse to any restaurant. She could remember everything she\u2019s ever tasted and unfortunately for you, she\u2019s tasted over one hundred recipes for humans and you\u2019re convinced they\u2019re her favorite food. She acts like your friend and is polite to you but you know she\u2019s planning to eat you the second you drop your guard. Grace might even have you cooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which one will Lexi send you to help today? You were almost too afraid to find out.</span></div></div>",

Maybe he'll surprise me.\" Lexi turned to you before giving you your assignment. \"Tim,\" she says. \"Today you're going to be assisting Yulong with the advice column.\" \"Yes, Lexi.\" You say. You run out of Lexi's office and for once the sphinx is smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYulong was one of the easiest monsters in the building to work with. She was a giant green skinned Chinese dragoness. While western dragons were often cruel, barbaric, greedy and harmful to humans, Chinese dragons were patient, kind-hearted and wise. In fact, whenever Yulong got injured by your bad luck, she never held it against you. As you reached Yulong's desk, you saw that she was already at work and that she had her arm in a small cast. Yulong was in charge of the advice column. Because of her wisdom and patience, Lexi thought it would be best to leave the dragon lady in charge of helping people with personal problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYulong hears you coming and the elderly dragon turned her head to face you. \"Hello, Tim,\" she says to you. \"How are you today.\" \"I'm fine. Lexi asked me to help you with the advice column.\" Yulong lets out a cheerful laugh and lowers her long tail to lift you up. As you're on the dragon woman's desk, you see several letters that Yulong had yet to open, obviously from people seeking her wisdom and help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you turned around and see a photograph of a teenage dragoness who looked taller than Yulong and with golden yellow scales and long black hair with green highlights. \"That's my granddaughter, Topaz,\" says Yulong. \"She lives out in Dreadberry.\" \"She looks so beautiful,\" you say. \"And tall. She actually looks bigger than you. I thought dragons were supposed to keep getting bigger with age.\" Yulong shrugged her shoulders. \"Elderly dragons can sometimes shrivel and shrink like elderly humans. But I'm sure that Topaz is still growing. Although, half the advice letters I receive come from my son, James. He's been acting up ever since Topaz started dating.\" \"Why is that? Is she dating a real jerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly,\" says Yulong. \"Her boyfriend, George, well, he's a... western dragon. I usually try to avoid them myself but I don't have any prejudice against them. You see, Tim, western and Chinese dragons are very different. Not only in appearance but in attitude. James is afraid that George is like other western dragons and will lead Topaz astray.\" You let out a scoff. \"All fathers of teenage girls act that way, Yulong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYulong just lets out a laugh at that. \"Well, better get to work. Just pick one of the letters and we'll see who will be the first to get our advice in today's column.\" You nod your head and walk up to pick out one of Yulong's letters.</span></div></div>",

Yulong is right, Chinese dragons are wiser than western dragon, but of course each of the dragon sides has their own strengths and weaknesses. After you picked your letter that you wanted to do, you let Yulong know and then she proceeds to open the mail right up and notices the letter is from a teenage girl. Typical girls, but what this letter has a case that is quite interesting. Maybe this could be one of the jobs that won\u2019t give you any bad luck today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cDear Yulong. I am writing this to you because I am having such a problem with my twin sister as I wanted to spend more time with her; however we are like polar opposites of each other. I am smart in academics, and while my sister is decent in her grades, she is more like an athletic and really takes her skills for granted. I just want to help her getting a better future as the finals are coming up, and we are both seniors, and I really feel like she should get into a good college and stuff. Is there any advice that you can give me, as I want to help my twin sister.\u201d The letter said (from an unknown monster), and you were asked to read it out, and both you and Yulong were interested in what advice that you two could give to her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is a good one. Polar opposites! I would say that it\u2019s here decision, but perhaps at the same time, perhaps try to encourage her, and also spend some time with her doing things that she likes, and perhaps she might start to see things her way as well.\u201d Yulong said, as it is the wisest opinion. While you can encourage her, it is her own path that she chooses, and you should respect the path that she chosen for her life. You agreed with her stance with a head shake up and down. It is perhaps the wisest advice to give her. After all, everyone has a path that they chose in life, and unless it\u2019s a bad one, everyone should respect the life that they have chosen. \u201cThat is a good way of putting it Yulong. You are wise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true. Why not pick another letter while I write this once right now?\u201d Yulong smiled just as she replied to your statement. \u201cLike I said, I have nothing against the western dragons.\u201d You then went out and picked another letter and opened it, and right after Yulong finished writing that one letter, she proceeded to read the next letter. \u201cGot that one done, let\u2019s see what this one holds.\u201d<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\u201cHello Yulong, this is Kari, and I am a drider. Both me and Sonia live in the human world, and we both want to help out the humans somehow, and both me and Sonia don\u2019t know what to do, is there anything that you can suggest?\u201d the letter said.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is an interesting question.\u201d Yulong thought, and then proceeded to turn to you. \u201cIs there any advice you can give them?\u201d \u201cWell I honestly don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know them myself. I really didn\u2019t had a lot of experiences in my own world. My life was incredibly jinx with bad luck, and I caused so many problems that my town exiled me to Fearfield, so I honestly don\u2019t know on that one.\u201d You told her with completely honesty. \u201cWell sometimes it\u2019s view life that can make an impact. From the sense that what you had, it must seems that you have some negativity in you.\u201d Yulong told you, and you listen to her advice. \u201cThat is true and I need to start looking more up. Besides, what I am doing right now doesn\u2019t have bad luck. I could say that perhaps they could do some good deeds like playing with the kids, helping out in construction, and those stuff like that.\u201d you told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat could be some good advice. I will also add that perhaps if anyone ask them for help, perhaps accept the offer.\u201d Yulong then replied to you. \u201cI will grab one more letter than I am taking a break.\u201d You replied to her just as you started to get exhausted. \u201cI agree, some of these letters are quite challenging and could give your brain a hard time processing, also good to reduce the stress level.\u201d Yulong replied just as she agrees with your idea. You then went and pick up the last letter you are doing with her for right now. This one is a bit of a juicy one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYulong, this is your friend Argetha. Funny enough I am not one of those aggressive western dragons, and in fact I am kinda like you.  I won the lottery and I am just a bit nervous about all the money that we have right now, and that I might end up going crazy with it. Is there any advice that you can give me?\u201d the letter said.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell both you and I never won the lottery, but with money comes a big thing, good management.\u201d You said to Yulong. \u201cIf I won the lottery, I would pay off the house, pay off the taxes, and invest in a business.\u201d \u201cThat is easily the best advice I can give anyone. Don\u2019t blow the money off so quickly. I had a few friends who I told them not to blow their money, yet they did, and\u2026 let\u2019s just say that things went downhill for them.\u201d Yulong told you just as she writes the advice for her. \u201cGood idea.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you got the last letter done, both you and Yulong begin to take a good break from all the advice giving, and you prepare to later give more out. That is when\u2026?</span></div></div>",

Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't actually have the answer for that. \"I'm not sure... maybe Lexi was hoping you'd crush me or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleotiti finally gathered up the courage to bend down to get a look at you. \"Y-you seem like a n-nice human...

It was of Henriette on a Paris catwalk. She was a blue skinned succubus with red hair reaching her lower back and orange eyes. She had medium sized wings and a devil tail. But that wasn't her most notable thing. She was gargantuanlly fat. She even made Mazee look like a twig. You were amazed that she could even move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not happy to here Cleotiti's project. Henrietta was a BBW model, the first succubus one, and considered one of the best. But she was also, for lack of a better term, a complete bitch. She was extremely selfish and arrogant, only caring about herself. She also had a reputation for being extremely hard to work with. She was also absolutely obsessed with getting even fatter. She wanted to be the first BBW model to be completely immobile. And you had a feeling she wouldn't stop then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do want to interview her? She's one of the biggest diva's ever. Every other person she's worked with says she's ungodly self-centered.\" You ask Cleotiti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Because interviews with her are really rare. I-If I get one, m-maybe the Daily T-Tombstone will be even more p-popular.\" She explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense.

The Daily Tombstone was a great place. How could she call it a dump?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleotiti took you in her shaking hand and left the building, heading for her car. Once in her car, she placed you in a cup-holder and drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 40 minutes later, you arrive at the apartment building the penthouse was at. It was a much more expensive building than Monster Arms and much nicer. Henrietta's penthouse was the entirity of the top 3 floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting you on her shoulder, Cleotiti walks up to the intercom. She pushes a button. \"Ms. de Hellta? I am Cleotiti. We have an interview with you schedueled.\" She was trying to sound professional inspite of her fear. A few seconds pass, and then a German-accented voice came through the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Cleotiti enter the building and head for the elevator. Cleotiti pushes the button for floor 68, the bottom of Henrietta's penthouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, the elevator reaches the floor and the doors open. You look at the penthouse in awe. It was really high class. Marble floors, various paintings and sculptures, rare plants everywhere. As much of a bitch as she was, Henrietta knew how to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sitting at a mahogeny table in the center, eating a massive meal, was Henrietta herself. She was only clad in black underwear that you guessed was made of some expensive material. And from the looks of it, she was even fatter now than she was in the picture. Her gargantuan rear and giant breasts were straining the underwear, and her titanic belly filled up her lap.<br>\r\nShe turned her head and looked at you. Slowly, she got up out of the chair and waddle towards you. Even on Cleotiti's shoulder, you felt the tremors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, Ms. Cleotiti.\" Henrietta said, in the same German accent as on the intercom. You had thought a servent called down. \"You have the honor of being in the presence of the greatest and fattest BBW model in history, Henrietta de Hellta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, we just met and already she's being an egotist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any servents? We've never heard you speak before, so we didn't know that was you.\" Cleotiti says, still trying to sound professional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, but I refuse to let them use the intercom. I don't want to deny the public the chance to hear my lovely voice.\" Henrietta told her. She was really being an egotist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she continued, she saw you on Cleotiti's shoulder.

Oh my. I... I didn't know.\" For somebody who had a reputation for being very mean and selfish, Henrietta actually looked embarrassed at what she had done. You even give a deep breath as Mazee shows her teeth and looks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're afraid that Mazee is going to be angry with you since another girl had her hands on you but then Mazee turns to Henrietta. \"Just make sure that it doesn't happen again.\" Henrietta gives a nervous laugh. \"Look,\" she says. \"I'll admit I'm not the nicest person, but I'd never steal another girl's man. That's not the kind of creature I am.\" You give a sigh of relief and then Mazee kisses you. \"Well,\" says Mazee. \"I think I'll let it slide this time.

We just have to wait for Willa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee looks in confusion. \"Willa?\" she asks. \"Why Willa?\" You give a giggle. \"It's a surprise, silly. Hey, where did Willa go.\" Mazee bit her lip. \"Willa had the unenviable task of interviewing an acquaintance of Henrietta. Julia Henrik.\" You gag both literally and mentally. \"That woman child? No thanks.\" You hear a scream and then sure enough, you see Willa walking forward with her hand to her face and growling. \"Willa?\" you ask. \"Are you alright?\" Willa let out a sigh. \"That blasted gator nearly drove me to tear my hair out. Lexi had better give me a raise for this.\" Then Willa notices Mazee and looks in surprise. \"Mazee? I thought Tim was assigned to Cleo.\" Mazee nodded her head. \"He was. But Henrietta wanted more than one reporter at the scene.\" Willa nods her head. \"Too right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then gesture to Willa and Willa blinks. \"Oh. You're ready now. Alrighty then.\" Willa reaches into her pouch and Mazee looks in confusion. \"I have something to give you, Mazee,\" you say. \"And I asked Willa to hold it for me.... because it's too heavy for me to carry.\" Mazee looks in confusion and then gasps as Willa holds out a small box and then opens it.

So you smile and hold out your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleotiti nervously steps forward but then her eyes pop, she thinks back to the day where that one bad human set a loose bandage on her ankle on fire.

No humans were killed and Cleotiti herself survived only because she was already dead.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hockey,\" replied Emma. \"Today the Fearfield Fireworms vs the Chillingham Springheels.\" You were suddenly very afraid. Of all the sports, it had to be one of the most violent ones. This was hockey for crying out loud and monster hockey at that.\" Emma then walks into her car and places you in the cup holder. \"Uh, Emma,\" you say. \"Should you really be driving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of answering, Emma just takes off. Emma drives like a maniac and no sooner does she leave the tower does she run over a mailbox. Then she proceeds to hit a streetlight and manage to bend it, all while continuing her drive. One argus has to jump out of the way before being run down. You have to hold onto the sides of the cup holder for dear life. You then turn to see a dusty glasses case in the other cup holder. The fact was plain and simple. Emma's eyesight was terrible. Her driver's license required her to wear glasses but she refused to look like a \"geek\". That polar ursine is going to be the death of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thump, Emma arrives at the stadium and you fall out of the cup holder onto her fat stomach and get tangled in her fur as she parks the car. While you're still shaking off the landing, Emma plucks you out. \"We're here.\" The werebear says. You then look to see that Emma had managed to knock over the block that marks the parking space. \"One of these days,\" you say. \"They're gonna pull your license. Wear your glasses.\" Emma just lets out a scoff. \"And ruin my face? Forget it.\" You let out a moan. If she doesn't like glasses, she could at least buy a pair of contacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma then reaches into her purse and takes out a human sized snow parka. \"Here, Tim,\" you say. \"You're going to need this.\" You put on the parka as the skyscraper sized polar bear walks into the stadium with you. It isn't long until the two of you are in your seats. You're both in the front row so Emma could take notes about the game for the newspaper. Not to mention see the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma munches some popcorn as she stand on the guardrail with your camera out. You're shivering even with your snow parka on. After all, this was a dangerous sport. You heard in one hockey game, a Frankenstein actually got his head knocked off and in another game, an Argus lost a few eyes. The fact was that hockey was already a pretty violent sport even without giant monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here they come!\" yelled Emma. \"Flame on Fireworms!\" Emma's yelling forces you to grab your ears in pain as the home team comes forward. The home team was lead by a phoenix and consisted of a dragon, a hydra, a European dragon, a Japanese dragon, a hellhound, a minotaur, a manticore, a golem and an ifrit. The Chillingham team came in next and was led by a Unicorn. It consisted of a gryphon, a hippogriff, a Nemean lion, a white weretiger, a gargoyle, a wereboar, a yeti, a werecrab and a woolly mammoth. All players looked pretty muscular and pretty aggressive looking and were even growling at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill them!\" yelled Emma. \"They came all the way from the other side of Mons Terra just to dig their own graves! Burn them to the ground, Albus!\" Emma is hardly the only fan booing the Chillingham Springheel. She's just yelling louder than the rest of them. Then you look forward to see the goblin referee walking forward. From the looks of it, he is wearing a suit of armor and has bandages underneath as well as a hook for a hand. If that was how they treated the ref, you're terrified of the carnage that goes on on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ref drop the first puck and the game begins. You snap photographs and you're horrified at what you see. Immediately the game goes into what can best be described as hell on Earth and the fight to get the puck turns nasty. The Chinese dragon has the puck and the werecrab is trying to get it from him, all while trying to strangle him. In response the dragon blew flames in the crab's face right before the Nemean lion tackles him. You look forward and scream because both of them are coming right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap a picture right before they both hit the guardrail and you scream and fall, not that Emma notices since her eyes are glued to the game. But the impact was so strong that you were knocked into...</span></div></div>",

Three new movies just came out today.\" \"That's right, handsome,\" says Blake full of lust. \"And Lexi wants me to give them the once over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to look at the three synopsis in the pamphlets to get a good idea of what you were looking at. After all, you needed to know what to expect. As much as you hated working with Blake and were afraid of her trying to steal you away from Mazee, you were still assigned to help her and from the looks of it, there were three interesting looking movies to review.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first movie was one called <i>Royal Caper</i>. From the looks of it, it was a murder mystery movie involving 12 monsters of different species who each related to one of the royal suits in a deck of playing cards in some way. But there is a killer among them who has a reason to want at least a handful of the others dead. You are initially interested until you read exactly who wrote that movie. \"Jin Orobutcher?\" you ask. \"Oh no. I hope we don't have to review this movie. You heard of Orobutcher. You heard he was a tsuchinoko infamous for writing movies about death and destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope that the second movie is much better, but then you see that the second movie is entitled <i>Hundred Woods</i>, it was a horror movie in which four mental patients have escaped into a cursed forest and while trying to survive the dangers of the woods, they were out to kill each other. Damn, why did the first two movies have to be horror movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last one was hardly any better. It was a movie called Scarlet Moon. It took place during the 1712 werewolf vampire war and from the looks of it, it was a romance movie between a werewolf and a vampire. Leave it to Blake to use a romance movie as an excuse to get close to you. There was also a sub plot in that movie about a vampire scientist using a strange potion to convert other monster species into vampire versions of themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake soon reaches the theater and pays for her ticket and yours as you ride on the horny weretiger's shoulder. \"So, what movie are we reviewing, Blake?\" you ask nervously.</span></div></div>",

As the weretigress is applying her makeup, you look on the passenger's seat to see a little black dress that was obviously too small for Blake's massive weight. As Blake puts her seatbelt on and starts the car to drive off. \"So you're wearing clothes for a change?\" you ask. \"This movie \"The Escapist\" must be good if you're getting dressed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Blake flicks you with her claws and you start to tumble down her chest screaming before you land between that fat cat's naked breasts. Blake purrs and shakes her tail in her seat. \"Oh, I already reviewed the movie yesterday. I just 'forgot' to tell Lexi.\" You were confused as you try to stand up between the two mountains of tiger flesh. \"Wait, but if the job is finished, what do you need me fo.... oh crap.\" Blake purrs again and pets you on the head like you're a pet. \"My cousin Kath told me about a restaurant on the Terrordale-Fearfield border and Grace gave it five stars already. Don't worry. I'll pay for everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally realize what's going on and gasp. \"Blake!\" you yell. \"No! This isn't a date is it?!\" Blake lets out a purr. \"But if Mazee finds out about this, she'll grind my bones into dust. You have no idea how scary she can be when she's mad.\" Blake sticks out her tongue as she parks the car. \"Oh please, we both know you can do better than that overgrown cheese muncher. Have you even noticed what she smells like? It's disgusting.\" \"She's a rat. She can't help it. Please don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you gag as Blake puts on her little black dress, sealing you between her breasts. The dress was so tight on Blake it could be considered a tattoo. You look up to see the sign outside the restaurant read, \"Harvest Moon\". You had a bad feeling about this. \"Oh crap.\" Blake is humming to herself as she walks into the restaurant. You bite your nails because if Mazee found out about this, she'd kill you, or worse, dump you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake walks up to the maitre'd, a titanic werebat. \"Good evening Ms. William. Table for one I trust.\" \"Table for two actually.\" Says Blake pointing to you wedged in her cleavage. The werebat is caught by surprised but shrugs his shoulders. \"Right this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the table, Black squeezes you out of her breasts and you tumble into a saltshaker. \"A waitress will be with you right away.\" Says the maitre'd before he walks off. You let out a groan but Blake just smiles seductively down at you. \"I can't believe you tricked me you fat orange cat! I never agreed to this!\" Blake just lets out a laugh. \"Believe me, after tonight. You'll forget about Mazee.\" You shake your head. \"Fat chance fat cat.\" You think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you feel tremors and look to see a waitress was coming forward, but who is it?</span></div></div>",

The waitress was a giant wererat, similar in body shape to Mazee but with yellow-brown fur and blonde hair and she was smiling slyly down at you. \"Oh no.\" You mutter. Even Blake looks slightly worried and bites her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wererat girl was Kimberley, one of Mazee's six younger sisters. Being a rodent, Mazee came from a big family, but you weren't fond of any of her sisters. Unlike Mazee, those rats were predatory towards humans. In fact, the first time Mazee introduced you, Kimberley asked your girlfriend if she was going to eat you. But now, you were unwillingly on a date with Blake and knowing Kimberley, she'd see this as a way to get you into trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well,\" says Kimberley as she wiggles her tail and grins at you. \"That doesn't look like my sis. Have a thing for tigers now Tim-Tim?\" You start to sweat and turn to Blake who just turns her head the other way. \"Don't give me that,\" you say in annoyance. \"This wasn't my idea you gender bent Garfield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut things are quickly going from bad to worse because Kimberley is taking out her cell phone. You're more afraid than ever. She was going to rat you out to Mazee. If Mazee thinks you're cheating on her with Blake, you're dead. \"Wait!\" you yell. \"Kimberley! This isn't what it looks like! Blake tricked me!\" \"Excuse me?\" asks Blake in shock. \"Kimberley,\" you say. \"You know I'd never cheat on Mazee. This isn't what you think. Please don't tell her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger wererat actually seems to be considering whether or not she should tell her sister. She probably knows this isn't what it looks like, but you wouldn't be surprised if she would make it look that way just to get you in hot water with Mazee.</span></div></div>",

It was a long run, plus you managed to injure several monsters along the way and almost burned down the entire top floor. As soon as your hear rate went down, you look up to the giant cubicles where the reporters worked and you walked over to Grace's. You were scared to work with the giantess, but you were also more scared to lose your job. You confidently make your way to the werecheetah's cubicle and you see her doing what she was good at, eating. She was enjoying what looked like deep fried balls of some kind, and Grace was wolfing them down by the handfuls. You take a deep breath and move over to her feet. <br>\r\n\"Hey Grace!\" you called up to her. She stopped eating for a moment and looked around for a moment before realizing your presence. She looked down and smiled when she saw you.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Tim! How nice to see you! Come here real quick...\" she said as she reached down for you. You allowed her to pick you up, and she set you down on her desk and brought her face too close to you. <br>\r\n\"Hi Grace...Lexi told me that I should you work today.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh great, I was just trying these tiny dumplings. Do you want one?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll try one\" you say, and walk towards the plate of food, while keeping one eye on Grace. Each one of the dumplings were around your size, so you pick out a fairly small one and pull it to the edge for you to eat.<br>\r\n\"I personally like them with just a drop of hot sauce\" she says \"here, try it.\" She reached into a drawer of her desk and pulled out a bottle of red sauce and pushed it to you. You tried to grab it, but you tripped over a dumpling and fell over. The cap fell off and doused the fried food in red, spicy sauce, and you were also covered in the sauce, which burned at your eyes.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Grace...\" you say<br>\r\n\"Oh its alright Tim, I'll...</span></div></div>",

You scream slightly because you're sure she's finally going to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut surprisingly, Grace only sticks out her tongue and licks all around you. You're in utter pain because her tongue is as rough as sandpaper, which made sense since Grace was a cat based monster. But that's not what disturbs you so much as the fact that the cheetah giantess is purring as she laps the hot sauce off your tiny body. She's obviously enjoying your taste. As soon as the hot sauce has been licked off, Grace breaks you off a piece of the dumplings before she starts scarfing again. You bite into the dumpling and it has an odd taste, but you like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realize these dumplings were made by monsters. Who knows what they're made of? You decided not to question Grace on answers you might not want to know. \"They're good Grace. Are these from a new restaurant.\" Grace shakes her head and eats three more dumplings before she answers you. \"Nah, Korina was just trying out a new recipe and wanted an expert's opinion. Could stand to use a little more salt, but otherwise they're okay. But that does remind me. I'm assigned to inspect a new restaurant that opened up in town. After all, they'll need my okay if they commence with setting up shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a nervous laugh as Grace smiles down at you and shows you her teeth as she waves her tail. You weren't going to drop your guard. Grace had a big appetite, so much that you wonder how all of it could go to her hips and ass alone. But you knew for a fact that Grace would gobble you up the second you got careless. Some of the restaurants she judged had people on the menu served in various ways and Grace ate so many humans she developed a taste for them and you're certain they're her favorite food. Grace's predatory nature was made even scarier since she acted so polite and friendly towards you, just like a serial killer, you could see it in the gleam of her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Grace wasn't trying to eat you now so you gulp and ask her a question. \"So, you need me to help inspect the place.\" Grace nods her head. \"That's right. And please bring your camera so I can highlight what I like the most. Hope you have a stomach for monster cuisine.\" Grace takes you in her palm before she places you in her back pocket. \"Uh Grace,\" you say. \"One last question.\" \"Relax, this is work Tim. Not a date. Mazee will understand.\" You didn't see it, but as Grace was saying this, she licked her lips. Going to a monster restaurant with a 675ft tall cat you knew for a fact wanted to eat you.

I'd even settle for Blake!\" But you doubt anyone can hear you screaming as the walls of the werecheetah's mouth would no doubt muffle the sound. You're certain this is it but then you hear a grunt and you're suddenly pushed to the front of Grace's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you knew the teeth opened up and you fell out into a giant furry hand. You didn't know who it was, but since the fur wasn't bright yellow, it obviously wasn't Grace. Speak of the devil, you look up and see that Grace was holding her stomach in pain. Somebody punched her. That's why she spat you out. You stand up and let out a sigh of relief as you shake off cheetah drool and hold onto one of the hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly you see that the fur in this hand was a familiar teal color and gulp before you look up at a familiar pair of mismatched eyes belonging to a certain werejackal. \"Aurelia!\" you yell. Aurelia looks down at you with a large toothy smile. You weren't rescued. The predator just changed. Grace recovers from that punch and gets up before growling at Aurelia. \"What's the big deal Aurelia?\" she asks. \"I almost had him.\" Aurelia shook her head. \"He was in my mouth first Grace, that makes him mine.\" This was true, the last time you worked with Aurelia, she had you half-way down her throat and almost swallowed you. If she hadn't sneezed, you'd be jackal chow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace wasn't amused to have her prey stolen however and held out her hands to show Aurelia her claws. \"Listen here you bastard child of Anubis, you had your chance with the morsel. He's mine.\" Aurelia pinches Grace on one of her hips and Grace grunts in pain. \"I don't think so Spots,\" says Aurelia with a sneer. \"Your ass is much too fat already.\" \"Like you'd know,\" says Grace angrily. \"You're married to that repugnant werehyena blob.\" \"You leave Cree out of this!\" Aurelia puts you down on the table and puts pencil cup over you so you won't escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's settle this like cats and dogs.\" Says Grace. Grace hold out her claws and Aurelia lets out a growl before the two of them tackle each other and wrestle to the ground. You cover your eyes as yellow and teal strands of fur fly in the air and you hear the noises of frantic barking and meowing. You don't know who to root for though given that no matter who wins the fight, you'd get eaten. Then you wonder why nobody is stopping the fight. You'd think somebody would get bothered by the noises of a literal cat and dog fight going on. At one point you see Grace's glasses fly up and land in front of you as you scream. This wouldn't end well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the noises and the beatings stop and one of the giantesses rises triumphant. The question is, who won the fight?</span></div></div>",

Maybe for today, I should give him a job at the building, one that hopefully he won\u2019t survive. Let\u2019s see, there\u2019s the delivery girl, Harley the wereboar. That supersized swine is the most reckless driver I\u2019ve ever seen. Sometimes I wonder why her license hasn\u2019t been suspended. If Tim accompanies her, the bumpy ride might toss him far away or even throw him into traffic to turn him into roadkill. But wait Lexi, there\u2019s still Kiki, that lazy tanuki bum. As far as secretaries go, she leaves much to be desired. She\u2019s lucky I\u2019m not mean enough to fire her. But her apathy makes her dangerous to Tim. Last time I paired those two, the big tanuki had the runt plastered to her skirt all day. And then there\u2019s the fact she doesn\u2019t bother to pick off humans that get stuck to her food.\u201d Lexi laughs to herself as you look in confusion, before she continues thinking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll be nice and stick her with Fate. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t kill me to give him a chance and it\u2019s doubtful Fate would kill him. She\u2019s a gargoyle for crying out loud and she\u2019s too much of a stone face to care whether or not Tim\u2019s bad luck. Wait, that\u2019s a mistake. If the little jinx gets her seriously hurt, we\u2019ll be defenseless when the night comes. Not to mention, Destiny will make a fur coat out of me. Maybe I should assign him to Beth the guard we mainly have in during the day. That behemoth is a lot harder on humans than Fate and she\u2019ll have Tim under her toes, or her ass, in no time. But Beth has that crush on Tim. Maybe she\u2019ll finally manage to seduce him. Oh yeah, then Mazee would murder him. I can just imagine her blowing her top and squishing him like a bug. But then there\u2019s the perfect human killing worker I have. Aurelia. I had to hire the werejackal because the bonehead keeps destroying the building and the equipment. She\u2019s the best carpenter and technician around, but she and that hyperactive werehyena wife of hers are total gluttons when it comes to humans. Aurelia almost had me rid of the little pest. Makes you wonder why she\u2019d want to eat Tim if he\u2019s the reason we need her so much. At this point, I don\u2019t care as long as someone gets rid of that stupid human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Lexi!\u201d you yell up to your gargantuan boss. \u201cHello.\u201d Lexi looks down and smiles at you. \u201cGood news.

I have her partner right here.\" Harley enters the room and you look up to see nothing but tight black leather shorts and thunderous thighs of yellow-orange fur. Harley bends over on her knees and you look up at the wereboar giantess's face. The porcine giantess lets out a snort and blows you on your feet. \"Buenos Dias Tim,\" she says in her Brazilian accent. \"Ready to go mucho rapido.\" Before you can say another word Harley lifts you up and brings you in front of her face. Those large tusks of hers were intimidating, but Harley assured you she doesn't eat humans. \"I'm ready whenever you are Harley.\" You say. Harley snorts and then walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley was a mystery to you. After all, her job was basically being a paper girl even though she was a grown adult. You also had no idea why she was Brazilian. Could monsters even have nationalities. Harley takes you down to the parking and brings you to her motorcycle. It was bright green, heavily built with a sidecar and had a warthog's head decoration in the front. There were even gold flames painted on the sides. Harley places a stack of newspapers in the sidecar as she boards the vehicle and then places you on the back of her neck as you grab hold of the pig woman's back hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on tight,\" Harley says sweetly. \"I'm breaking my record today.\" You let out a gulp as Harley revs the motorcycle up and starts to leave the driveway. She's already taken off at the monster equivalent of 20 MPH and you let out a scream and start to slip as you continue holding her hog hair.

It looked like one of the apartment doors. \"Buenos Dias, Hermana.\" Says Harley as she enters the apartment. Inside you see there was another wereboar who you guessed was Circe. You only saw her from the back but from the looks of it, she was a crimson warthog-like were boar with long black hair that reached down to her ass that looked like it was even bigger than Harley's. She also appeared to have D-Cup breasts. She was wearing a blue bikini bottom that had stars on it and looked painted on her massive booty but also had star shaped tattoos on her thighs. She was wearing silver bracelets around her wrists and ankles and was wearing a red breastplate. If she only had a tiara, she'd look like a porcine Wonder Woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of it, the wereboar woman had just taken breakfast out of the oven. Circe stood up and you saw that she was 75ft shorter than Harley despite being clearly fatter than her sister. \"Harley,\" says Circe in surprise. \"You're here surprisingly early, Big Sister.\" Harley and Circe share a hug and each let out a squeal just as you finally manage to crawl out of Harley's ass crack and are walking on her waistband. Unfortunately, you lose your footing and yell before you slip and fall into the back of Circe's bikini bottom. You let out a groan. \"This must be my day for pork butt.\" You groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" says Circe. \"As long as you're here, why not stay for breakfast, Harley? I just finished preparing some styracosaurus steaks and pterodactyl eggs. With that, both pig sisters sit down for breakfast and you're pinned under Circe's monumental ass. You try to shake your way out, but it's even tighter in Circe's cheeks than it was between Harley's cheeks. From your vantage point, you see a photograph on the counter that was in the shape of a heart. It appeared to be a human young man with white hair who looked like he was on the shoulder of what you think is a werewolf with golden blonde hair and a red hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Circe,\" says Harley. \"Did you finally get a date with that Edgar boy.\" Circe just lets out a sigh and digs her face into her plate to devour a few eggs. \"No,\" she mutters. \"But next time for sure. The trouble is all those tramps want him too, so he's too busy being fought over to go on a date.\" You turn your head and see a chart that had several female monsters, all of which were SSBBWs, some even bigger than Circe. The chart included a VERY pear-shaped red skinned gargoyle girl in a bikini with her hair worn in a purple ponytail, A purple-furred flying monkey sitting on top of a skyscraper, a yellow-green apple-shaped kappa girl eating a pizza and an obese great-white landshark girl dressed like a treasure hunter among other monster girls. That chart also had several darts in it. One of which hit a photograph of an obese frankenstein girl with wires coming out of her back in her mechanical eye. Looks like Harley had competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley pours a glob of ketchup onto her steak and eats before shoving her face in and swallowing her meal, even biting the plate in half in the process. \"I know,\" says Harley. \"You just had to fall in love with an immortal hunk, even if he is human. That's why I only date women.\" Circe chugs her orange juice and lets out an earth-shattering belch before she continues. \"So, how's work.\" \"Can't complain. Speaking of which, I can't stay long or Lexi will blow her top. Muchas gracias for breakfast, Circe. You're getting better.\" Circe gives a smirk. \"Best chef in Horrorville. And don't you forget it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth pig sisters get up and from the looks of it, Harley is leaving. You try to yell for Harley but your mouth is full of Circe's bikini bottom.

She's almost always stressed.\" The kappa girl then reached into her shell and took out some strange green powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" you ask as she hands you the vial. \"It's called nebutori,\" says Shelly. \"It's a muscle relaxer. Just put it in your coffee and it goes right to work. Free of charge.\" \"Gee,\" you say. \"Thanks.\" \"Tim!\" yells Harley. \"Come over here! Aye carumba, you don't want to be here when Lupa gets the munchies.\" You immediately run off as the kappa laughs under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you and Harley leave, Shelly is confronted by a giant orange-skinned and white-haired gargoyle woman in a purple leotard and a red jacket and she looks pissed. \"Alright, Shelly, your ass is going to Under Gloom. I know you have nebutori. Try to weasel out of this and you're turtle soup.\" Shelly gives a smug grin. \"Go ahead and search me, Petra.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you get back to the daily tombstone, you hold up the vial of nebutori. You had no idea what that was but it was most likely Japanese from the name so Kiki might've known about it. But given how much that lazy tanuki sleeps, you wouldn't dare ask her. So you just pour the nebutori into the coffee pot. At that point, you hear somebody coming and accidentally drop the whole vial into the pot. Once the vial is emptied you jump out of the way. It was at this point, Fate walks into the break room and she looks tired. Since she works the night shift, she must've just gotten up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately she starts to pour herself a cup of coffee before Blake walks by, forcing you to hide behind a few napkins. \"Hi, Fate,\" says Blake. \"You look beat.\" Fate let out a yawn. \"I didn't sleep well yesterday.

I don't know what Wade did this time but she's gonna be fuming for days.\" Blake rolled her eyes and poured herself some coffee before she and Fate walked away. \"She needs another boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Fate and Blake leave, you have to hide behind the coffee pot because Tara pours herself some coffee and then drinks it before making a face. \"Yuck!\" yells the vampire woman. \"This coffee must be expired.\" Bea the succubus giantess walks forward and then drinks the same coffee. \"Don't be a baby, Tara,\" she says. \"It's perfectly fine.\" Bea continues to drink the coffee as she and Tara both walk away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi is next to come forward and you can hear she's mumbling to herself as she pours herself some coffee. \"I'm sure that idiot broke something in Monster Arms. I do not feel like reimbursing Cleotiti's sister.\" Lexi drinks her coffee before you look around. You think it's safe but then you hide again because Aurelia is next to pour herself some coffee. As you're hiding from Aurelia, she sniffs the coffee and gives a look of disgust but then shrugs her shoulders and drinks it. Given that jackals eat dead meat, she's probably used to rotten stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma is busy speaking with Yulong. \"Quit badgering me,\" says Emma as she pours herself some coffee. \"I do not have eye problems.\" \"Emma,\" says Yulong as she pours herself some coffee. \"You're seasoning your coffee with salt?\" Emma drinks the coffee and gagged before Yulong drank her own coffee. \"Smart aleck dragon.\" Says Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they leave, Mazee and Willa show up and you pop out as they start pouring their coffee. \"Hey, Tim,\" says Mazee. \"I heard you went to Monster Arms with Harley.\" \"Yep.\" You say as you crawl up Mazee's shoulder. Willa puts sugar in her coffee and shakes her head. \"Bad idea, mate,\" she says. \"There's a human-eating werewolf there who always has the munchies.\" \"Well, I didn't run into any werewolves but I ran into a weird kappa.\" \"Kappa?\" asks Mazee as she drinks the coffee again. \"Yeah,\" you say. \"She gave me some relaxing mist for the coffee.\" Willa gulped. \"You don't mean for this coffee do you?\" asks the bunyip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said it was something called Nebutori.\" Mazee grunts and Willa gags. \"Nebutori!?\" yelled Willa. \"Tim! You idiot!\" \"What?\" you ask. \"What did I do.\" Suddenly Willa and Mazee grunt and you could swear that they're getting bigger and fatter. They looked even bigger than Beth and that said something since Beth and Fate were the fattest monsters on the staff. But how much bigger than Beth are they now?</span></div></div>",

For one, they were both now 1300ft tall and their stomaches were 1000ft while their asses had swelled to 1500ft wide as they both grunted. Mazee's jeans were shredded as was her jacket and her shirt had shrunk to a bra as her cheeks expanded and she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilla grunted herself as her pants tore apart and she was standing in her underwear. You could see her big green ass in full view as her shirt tears apart and she has to use her jacket as a makeshift bra. \"Oh my gosh!\" you yell. Willa huffs and puffs as her pouch is stressed out and she's standing in her panties. You then turn your head and you see that the other monsters that drank the nebutori are experiencing similar side-effects. Aurelia's stomach has expanded to the point where she's the same body shape as her wife, Cree and she even has multiple chins as she lets out a growl. Yulong's breasts expand to the size of medicine balls as her hips follow suit and her long neck becomes several times as thick as a tree trunk. You then hear Tara scream as her pants are torn apart by her ass and her belly is bulging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim,\" says Mazee. \"What have you done? Pretty soon everyone in the building is going to have nebutori.\" You let out a groan as Mazee's stomach is pushing against you.

You put nebutori into the office's coffee and drinking water and it turned out to be a virus that made women morbidly obese and lethargic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee and Willa walk you to the office and you slide down Mazee's even larger than usual back before you walk under Lexi's office door, awaiting the chewing out of a lifetime. When you entered Lexi's office, you look up in horror because the nebutroi effected her really hard. Her belly was so bloated that it's a wonder that her hands and feet touched the ground. Since she always walked on all fours, you could see her belly was being dragged as she walked and her breasts had expanded to H-cup level. Lexi's ass had to be at least 2000ft wide and Lexi herself seemed 1500ft tall and that was on all fours without even standing up. She was stark naked because the nebutori caused her to outgrow her clothes and she had to have at least five chins as she stared down at you with rage in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are an imbecile!\" she yells. \"I can't believe you actually put nebutori in our coffee! What were you thinking?! Where did you even get that fattening disgusting sludge!? Look at me! I'm as big as the tower! I can't even think of a punishment severe enough you little bastard!\" You let out a gulp. \"Am I fired?\" Lexi growls in your face and you're less than an inch away from her frightening jaws as she drools on you. \"That's more than you deserve, you punk. If you hadn't solved my riddle, I'd bite your empty ****ing head off for this! This is your biggest screwup ever! Prepare for my punishment, you little cretin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you've done it.

The obese nebutori-infected sphinx gives you a view of her 2000ft wide booty and wiggles her tail. You gasp in fear as Lexi folds down her wings. \"Wait! Lexi! Don't be rash! Don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's too late as Lexi plops her enormous ass down on top of you and you're pinned underneath it. You let out muffled screams as Lexi smirks and wiggles her butt, causing you to get scrunched between the rolls of fat on one of Lexi's butt cheeks. You yell in pain for Lexi to stop but Lexi just purrs. \"Oh yes,\" says your leonine boss as she drags her butt behind her desk and rests her enormous belly and boobs onto her minuscule desk.. \"I rather enjoy this punishment. If there's anything that feels better than a human in my belly, it's a human stuck to the bottom of my ass. In fact, I think that I'm going to keep this weight. Congratulates, Tim. You've just been promoted to my personal throne.\" The sphinx laughed to herself as you had to hold back the folds of sphinx booty to avoid being crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were drenched in both your own sweat and the sweat from Lexi's fur. \"Come on, Lexi!\" you yell. \"I'm sorry!

Lexi then puts on her headphones so she doesn't have to listen to your complaining. You really couldn't wait for the work day to be over and done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the work day was over and everyone (except Fate) went home. You let out a sigh of relief. Lexi would soon be leaving for her own house and that meant she'd get off of you. Right? Wrong. So very wrong because at this point you're so stuck to Lexi's rear that you can't even move and you grunt as you try in vain to shake your way out.

You look like a tattoo. Lexi gives a purr as she feels your pain. Then she passes by the mirror in her office as she walks by on all four of her feet. She eyes her reflection and realizes it would take four mirrors for her to see her entire body. The large sphinx gives a vicious toothy smile. \u201cHmm,\u201d says Lexi. \u201cI think I like myself better this way now that I think about it. It makes me feel large and in charge. You know, Tim. I have two nieces and although I know they\u2019re sphinxes, they look more like fur-covered whales. But now thanks to your bumbling, I\u2019m three times bigger than either of them and I like it. Because it makes you even smaller by comparison.\u201d Lexi gives an evil laugh and you give a groan. You had finally destroyed what little sanity Lexi had left. Lexi shakes her rear and you grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you still stuck to her, Lexi waddles out of her office, tearing the doorway apart to make room for all of her mass. She passes by the guard room where Fate is sitting on and murdering four chairs at once as she watches the monitors. Fate pauses to yawn, not even noticing that you were stuck to Lexi. Lexi then makes her way out of the building. \u201cWait,\u201d you think. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she head for the parking lot.\u201d You grunt. \u201cUh, Lexi? Where\u2019s your car.\u201d Lexi gives a scoff. \u201cI don\u2019t have a car, Tim. I\u2019m a sphinx. I fly to work everyday.\u201d You\u2019re baffled. \u201cShe can\u2019t really be thinking of flying,\u201d you think to yourself. \u201cShe\u2019s 20 times fatter than she was this morning. She can\u2019t possibly....\u201d But to your surprise, the enormous sphinx flaps her wings and then she takes off over Fearfield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop your jaw. You didn\u2019t think that Lexi could still fly, but here she was. It took her a little more effort than usual to get her hulk off the ground but she manages to do it. You see a quartet enlarged gargoyle women fly overhead and you begin to suspect that despite the nebutori, some of these girls still had muscle under all that flab. You then start to think and realize you had no idea where Lexi even lived. You suspected she lived in an area of high ground since she was a sphinx and she was the boss of the paper, so you expect it to be in the high society part of Fearfield. You wonder to yourself where Lexi lives. However, as Lexi flies there is a sudden gust of wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are peeled from Lexi\u2019s butt and you are blown to her tail and yell as you grab the end in an attempt to hold on. \u201cOh no,\u201d you say. \u201cOh no, oh no.\u201d The wind is very strong.

Her frown deepens, as she didn't like being interrupted, specially not when she was about to bring forth despair and ruination to someone. Fuming, she leans back on her bloated taur body, causing it to wobble a bit, and mumbles a 'come in'. As if on cue, Mazee and Willa squeeze themselves in, their much wider bodies nearly getting stuck on the doorframe. \"Ma'am? This wasn't Tim's fault. He was forced into buying the powder by someone hundreds of times his size, he wasn't in a position to refuse.\" Willa declared, her voice firm, while Mazee just gave you a curt nod and a wink. They were covering for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt as if you were being flooded away by a huge wave of relief. The same could not be said of your obese boss, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you have got to be kidding me. I didn't expect this, not from you, Willa.\" Lexi's face contorted from one of shocked disbelief into one of fury, fangs bared at the two bloated titanesses, and she pointed a thick finger at your girlfriend. \" Her, I can understand, but you Willa??!\" The wererat took a step forward, pointing at you with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, it's as Willa says, the one who gave him that stuff was someone with a reputation for smuggling illegal goods. Tim didn't know any better, he just thought she was trying to earn a quick buck by selling a muscle relaxant.\" Mazee pleaded, her chubby hands clasped tightly together. \"He told us what happened when he was there with Harley, and he dropped the kappa's name; I've heard of her, an acquaintance of mine had purchased a hair tonic from her, and the next day he had grown a small bonsai tree on his head. When he tried to find her, she vanished completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGears grinding in your head, you decided to play along as well, as angry as the sphinx might be, she is not devoid of reason or logic. Not yet, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, boss! That kappa would've have crushed me flat if I refused, I mean, if you just gave her one look, you'd knew right away she's a dangerous one! I had no choice!\" you pant out, trying to sound convincing in the mad hope Lexi would buy it. \"I thought it was something to help everyone here! I don't speak Japanese, how could I know what it was??\" She narrowed her eyes and gave you a look that signaled 'certain doom' in bright neon lights. After a tense pause, she half sighed, half growled and pinched the bridge of her nose, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...One of these days, Tim. One more slip-up from you, and you're HISTORY!!\" you exhaled again in relief, while Willa and Mazee exchanged furtive glances to each other, also relieved. Lexi fumed, once again denied the opportunity to end her source of grief once and for all. She gave the three of you an angry look and raised her voice. \" You're still here? GET OUT OF MY SIGHT!!\" As you move to leave her be, a thought pops into your head, and you turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, does that mean I'm not fired?\" both Willa and your girlfriend froze in their tracks as you asked that, groaning in annoyance and recoiling in advance, as Lexi was clearly not in the mood for your tomfoolery. She rose up in an instant and roared at the top of her lungs, the wind pressure nearly knocking you off your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"OUUUUUT!!!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee grabs you and the three of you depart in a rush (or, as much as their heavier bodies would allow), eager to comply with your boss's request. After the dust had settled, Lexi just plops herself down again with a loud thud, shaking the room, and drops her face on the desk noisily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ugh... why did I get out of bed today?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So you shot yourself in the foot.\u201d You let out a nervous laugh. \u201cAt least I\u2019ll have more room, Willa.\u201d The bunyip just gives a glare at you. \u201cThat\u2019s providing I don\u2019t decide to evict you for this catastrophe.\u201d \u201cWilla,\u201d says Mazee. \u201cLeave him alone. Like we both just told Lexi, he was forced to buy it from that kappa and didn\u2019t know what it really was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilla looked around. \"Try telling that to everyone else, mate.\" It would seem that everyone in the Daily Tombstone was affected by the nebutori. You climb up Maggie's shoulder and take a look around at the damage you did. \"Oh my gosh!\" you yell. Aurelia was 1500ft tall. Her ass and stomach were the biggest parts of her, just like it was with her wife. Her cheeks were puffed up and her clothes had completely ripped, leaving her stark naked except for her tool belt. Yulong\u2019s rear was so big that she was pinned to the ground, to say nothing of her neck that was so thick, her face looked minuscule on it. Tara was pear-shaped and standing in her underwear as she rubbed her ass that knocked over a cubicle as Tara had a look of pure hatred on her face. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d says the vampiress. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure that bastard, Tim, had something to do with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp and then you look in the cubicle to see that Blake was so bloated her stomach was touching the ground and she seemed to be dragging it. She looked like she was slightly bigger than Aurelia. The tigress blew a kiss your way as her 15800ft wide belly touched the ground and her breasts were so fattened that they almost hid her face. Fate walked by and she was looking at shock in her mirror. She was 1700ft tall with an 1800ft wide stomach and ass. Her face was so fat that she had at least seven chins and didn\u2019t appear to have a neck anymore. Her wings looked so undersized they were practically chicken wings. \"This is going to take some explaining.\" Says Fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBea was fuming mad because she was so fat that her business suit looked painted on. Her ass cheeks were so big that each one needed two stools to hold it up and her breasts were so fat that she had a hunch in her back. But then you see something that catches you by surprise. It was Cleotiti and her ass was so big that you could see that her bandages were barely covering up her mummified cheeks. They looked like they needed their own butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did Cleotiti get fat?\u201d you ask. \u201cI didn\u2019t see her drink the coffee.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t have to, mate,\u201d says Willa. \u201cNebutori spreads like wildfire.\u201d Cleotiti then pointed to Mar who was playing a handheld game while her ass was so big she was completely immobile, but she wasn\u2019t letting it get in the way of her job. Cleotiti then accidentally bumped into Hecate. Hecate groaned and then she felt her body expanding. She had grown to the same size as Fate as her ass bloated out and her stomach expanded to 1200ft wide. Her jeans tore at the seams as you saw her panties. \u201cJust like Mom,\u201d sighed Hecate. \u201cBut bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were horrified. \u201cYou mean I unintentionally spread a plague.\u201d Mazee sadly nodded her head. \u201cAnd it\u2019s worse. Grace got infected and she left to inspect a few restaurants, so this plague has probably already spread throughout Fearfield. The streets are gonna be mobbed with impossibly obese SSBBW monster girls.\u201d You turn pale. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, mate,\u201d said Willa. \u201cIt\u2019s curable, but unfortunately, one of the key ingredients won\u2019t be able to reach Fearfield for a month.\u201d \u201cOh no!\u201d you yell before you look at Mazee. \u201cI\u2019m real sorry, Mazee. Thanks to your idiot boyfriend, you\u2019ll be stuck like this for a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee just kisses you, covering you in rat saliva from her enlarged lips. \u201cDon\u2019t worry baby. I don\u2019t blame you. I blame the kappa that tricked you. You said her name was Shelly, right?\u201d You nod your head. \u201cShelly Roshi,\u201d says Willa. \u201cHarley told me about her. She\u2019s a shifty character. Now, the three of us have been sent to do a story on this outbreak, so we need to go straight to the source. Monster Arms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilla and Mazee walked out and you see that the nebutori is already on the streets. But how are the three of you going to get to Horrorville?</span></div></div>",

Then you see a gorgon woman with seasnakes for hair and from the looks of it, her ass was three times as wide as the bench she was sitting on. There was also a nearby park and you see a morbidly obese albino manticore who was allowing her son to bounce on her 1500ft wide stomach.

Men can\u2019t get nebutori.\u201d The tiger grunts as he gives Mazee the tickets. \u201cYeah, but my wife can. The last time she caught nebutori, I had to carry her up 100 stairs. She gets real mean and bossy when she gets too fat.\u201d You begin to thank your lucky stars that there was no way Mazee could expect you to carry her even if she wasn\u2019t infected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee and Willi then walk to wait for the next train to Horrorville. Both giantesses had to stand. You see that there were exactly four monster giantesses that were waiting for the train as well and you take in your surroundings. There was a blue and black striped nue woman dressed like a businesswoman. She had the limbs of a tiger and a snake for a tail but unlike other nues, she had the head and torso of a lemur instead of a baboon. The nue woman was primarily bottom heavy and her cyan colored behind was visible underneath the skirt of her business suit that looked like it was coming apart. The buttons looked just about ready to pop. She was impatiently looking at her watch as she held a briefcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a very morbidly obese gargoyle woman with bright red-violet skin and spikey black hair. She had two large horns on her forehead that looked like those of a dinosaur and a beak for a mouth. She had to have a 2000ft wide belly and from the looks of it, she was wearing a black cocktail dress that looked painted on and was carrying what you hoped was a violin case. It probably was given her attire, but you did associate violin cases with guns. But then again, most gargoyles are law-abiding citizens if not law enforcers, so you were probably just paranoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the nue and the gargoyle was a morbidly obese and huge harpy woman who resembled an anthropomorphic swan with a human\u2019s face and long blonde hair. She had huge E-cup breasts and an ass that was so big that it was touching the ground even when she was standing up. The swan harpy from the looks of her attire was a policewoman but what horrified you was that the swan harpy was eating a kebob that had what looked like roasted humans on it. You really hope she doesn\u2019t see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally among the giant women was a titanic goth girl. This goth girl was a huge capricorn girl who had the upper body of a bright furred goat with red highlights in her silver hair and a red eyepatch and the scales of a butterfly on her legs and hooves. She was so morbidly obese that her udder looked bigger than her head and she need crutches in order to walk. She was too busy reading a book to notice anyone else. You felt that maybe it would be best as to not give these four strangers anything to do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028However the train comes and Willa gives a scoff. \u201cAbout time.\u201d She said. Unfortunately after everyone else has squeezed their obese frames into the train, Mazee and Willa try to squeeze it at once. \u201cWilla!\u201d yelled Mazee. \u201cI was going to go first!\u201d Willa and Mazee grunted and in the process you were squeezed between both your girlfriend and your landlady\u2019s massive bellies. You try to scream but their fat buffets you in the face and you\u2019re squeezed out. You land on one of the seats just as a monster giantess\u2019s morbidly titanic fat ass is about to sit on you. One of those four new monsters was going to trap you under her butt for the rest of the trip unless Mazee or Willa stopped her, but which of the four was about to sit on you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were either going to be flattened into the rear of a gargoyle violinist, a nue businesswoman, a capricorn goth or a swan harpy policewoman.</span></div></div>",

You need to be careful or she might crush you or knock you back down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resting on her lap you begin the next stage of the climb. Her torso. You crane your head and see her gigantic belly. Beyond that are her two massive breasts. Geez, it was like climbing a mountain made of other mountains.

Once you're ready you begin the last stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're about halfway up her breast you look outward and see that Kiki is slacking off. This doesn't surprise you at all.

However when you get there something splashes onto your head. It runs onto your face and you wipe it off to find that its kind of thick. You look up to see drool leaking from the side of Kiki's mouth. She's sleeping now!? This just gets better and better. As you become more frustrated you feel another shift in the environment. Kiki's folding her arms on the desk and laying her head down on them. Unfortunately, you get caught up in the movement and are now trapped between her cheek and her arm.

Well, actually you kind of do. \"How will that help?\" you say. \"And how are you stressed? If I rub your feet you'll probably just fall asleep again!\" Kiki leans in close and gives you a stare.

Unsurprisingly she forgot about you when she went on break. She reaches into the bag and pulls out a container. She opens the lid and grabs a fork.

You struggle and get yourself loose, but in turn you fall into her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you plop down into the container you find that its pasta.

This tanuki has almost eaten you a number of times now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the fork returns and you try to avoid it. You fail and it manages to once again catch your shirt.

You are gently deposited onto the front of her tongue with a resounding 'squish'. You don't get a lot of time to breathe as Kiki starts to move her food around with her tongue, she moves the pasta toward her molars before chewing once or twice and swallowing. You watch the scene from the front of her mouth almost at the tip of her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but notice how minimal her actions are. Yes, this is dimpling eating food so not much effort goes into it, but Kiki Ida barely even bothering to chew, and when her tongue barely even moves from its normal position, there's even some strands of pasta that go untouched as they are swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess she just as lazy about eating as she is about working\" you note. Suddenly a ray of light shines in as Kiki opens her mouth to dump another mouthful of pasta off of her fork. At first you start to head towards the opening, but then you get tangled in the pasta that's hanging haphazardly from the fork, you are carried back into the mouth and get yourself loose but end up back where you started. You quickly rise to try and catch a ride on the retreating fork but it's already passing between her lips. \"I'd better just find a safe spot for now...\" You think. You slide under the tanuki's tongue with a little effort and remain there through the course of her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the fork stops coming and you figure it's safe to try and get out now. As you climb back onto the tongue, a large thud knocks off your feet and onto your back. \"What the heck was that?!\" You wonder. A dull yet thin forums noise comes as your response. \"Snoring? She's sleeping again?!\" You ask in disbelief. \"Looks like I'll have to get out on my own...\"</span></div></div>",

You made a silent prayer of thanks to whatever benevolent diety saved you from joining Kiki's snack down her gullet. Though that gratitude turned to a curse as you neared the front of Kiki's mouth and saw that her lips were sealed up tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Figures,' you thought. 'I'm the size of a microbe compared to her. How am I gonna manage to climb up there and pry her lips apart?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, you stepped off her tongue, prepared to scale the inside of the tanuki's lips. However, once you did so, Kiki gave a dissatisfied moan in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What was that about?' you thought. 'Bad dreams?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki let out another sad moan and behind you, her tongue rose like a mighty leviathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki's tongue struck like a viper and slammed into you. As soon as it made contact with you, Kiki gave a satisfied moan of delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no, she wasn't moaning because of bad dreams. She was moaning because she missed your taste!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside Kiki smiled in her sleep, as she sucked on your body, savoring your flavor. To anyone in the world it would appear that Kiki was dreaming about eating a hard candy. For you, the reality was much more terrifying and painful. You were worked all along the inside of her mouth, squeezed by her tongue, the suction of her cheeks occasionally crushing you. All the while you screamed and struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several minutes before the sleeping tanuki was satisfied. She had gotten more than taste from her naptime snack. It was time to send it where it belonged. Her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue began to raise, reaching to her roof and curling backwards to her throat. You tried to scramble for a hold on one of her tastebuds but were unable to get a firm grip, your hands slipping on saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curse you benevolent diety!\" you cried as you slid downward, as though on a massive waterslide. Only this slide led to certain doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonononononononooooooooooo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you ran out of tongue and plummeted down the seemingly never-ending shaft of her throat. You fell for what felt like hours before you land with a splash in the corrosive acid of her stomach. You choked and flailed with the acid, until you found a nearby piece of pasta, that you climbed upon like a raft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Kiki gave a contented sigh in her sleep. A second later, Kiki's stomach groaned and she let loose a massive fart. It seemed like the room shook, and the expulsion of her own gas, caused her to waken with a start. She sniffed the air, and blushed, looking over her shoulders to make sure no one had heard. She quickly--for her anyway--resumed her work, trying to take her mind off her own embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her stomach, you grimaced. After all the close calls, all the screw-ups and near misses, your luck had finally run out. Kiki had eaten you and hadn't even realized it. Now you'll be digested and your biggest contribution to this paper will be giving your colleague gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No damn it!\" you said. \"That's quitter talk! I'm not gonna die in here! KIKI!\" you cried. \"KIKI! LET ME OUT! YOU ATE ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only response was the ominous squelches and growls of Kiki's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. What am I thinking? I have a perfectly good phone! I'll just make a call and rescue will come in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached into your pocket and your heart sank as you gazed into your phone's screen. The battery was so low it might as well count as the undead. You guessed you only had enough power left for one call. What would be your best hope of rescue?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee was your girlfriend, if she knew what happened, you were positive she would drop everything and come running to save you. But she was out in the field today. If you called her, she might arrive too late. Then there was Kiki. She was the one who ate you after all, and if you called her you might be able to talk her into getting you out...

It was only in for a second, but the tingling heat was enough to cause you to yelp and pull you're foot out. Unbeknownst to you, while you were pleading with Kiki, the piece of pasta that you were on had slowly started sinking beneath her gastric juices. You climbed further up the end of the pasta that wasn't submerged, and tried to peer out into the darkness of her stomach for something else you could use to keep yourself afloat. But there was nothing else, all the rest of her meal had already sunk beneath the waves of her stomach acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" you pleaded. \"KIKI! LET ME OUT! KIKI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pasta sunk faster. You had climb to the top of the food but were nearly submerged yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KIKI! MAZEE! ANYONE!

She was met with the familiar sight of Kiki snoring at her desk. \"Figures,\" she muttered. \"Kiki. Kiki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki woke with a start. \"Oh... Boss... I was just working on... that thing,\" she said, wiping an errant strand of drool off her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that,\" Lexi said, with a roll of her eyes. Lexi took a breath threw her nose and her face nearly turned green. \"Ah, dang it, Kiki, did you have to do that here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Kiki said. \"Something I ate... Didn't agree with me. But I'm feeling better now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi eyed the half eaten pasta container on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good to hear,\" Lexi said. \"So, where's Tim? Has he been doing everything you've asked like I told him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Kiki asked, genuinely not remembering the coworker she had doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim,\" Lexi said patiently. \"A human. A bad luck magnet. About this tall,\" she said, holding two of her claws an inch--to her--apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki furrowed her brow in thought. \"Oh,\" she said at last. \"Him... Um... he...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi stared at Kiki in open awe. She had never seen the tanuki apply herself so hard to think before. Once again, Lexi's eyes darted to the food container on Kiki's desk. She remembered the smell in the air and put two-and-two together. A smile broke across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiki, did Tim... \"join you\" for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

You're thrown off the fork and land on the table. \"Hey Sis!\" Sis? You look up at this newcomer and see that its another tanuki girl like Kiki. She's certainly not as heavy as Kiki, but is still a little thick. Her fur is the same color as Kiki's but her face markings look different. Judging from her greeting she's apparently Kiki's sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it going? Still working hard?\" asks the new tanuki. She says the latter half of that statement sarcastically. Kiki looks at her sister and sighs. \"What are you doing here Rockie? I'm sort of busy.\" This girl, Rockie apparently, laughs. \"Do you know how weird it is to hear YOU of all people say that?\" Kiki rolls her eyes and resumes eating. Rockie begins to open her mouth again but switches focus when she spots you. In a flash she's got her gigantic face in front of you, causing you to stumble back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh a human! What are you doing here little guy?\" she asks enthusiastically. You compose yourself and answer. \"I work here, my names Tim.\" you say as you stare at the huge tanuki. She cocks her head to the side. \"Work here? You? Aren't you a little small?\" You chuckle and rub the back of your head. \"Well its kind of complicated.\" She laughs and stands up to her full height. \"Well its nice to meet you Tim! My name's Rockie, and I'm Kiki's little sister! I just decided to stop by and say hi to my big sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans on her sister's shoulder and continues. \"So what are you doing here with my sister?\" Then her eyes widen a little. \"Oh! Are you two an item?\" Your own eyes widen at this. How did she come to that conclusion? \"He's a little small, but I guess he's cute. Nice going Sis!\" Rockie says as she nudges Kiki. \"No, I'm just helping Kiki with her work! I already have a girlfriend!\" you say while waving your arms. The last thing you needed was anyone getting the wrong idea. If it ever got back to Mazee, you'd be in trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiki sighs and turns to you. \"You want to know how you can help me? Keep my sister company.\" Wait, what? \"You heard the lady!\" Rockie says and snatches you up as she leaves. You catch a last glimpse of Kiki eating as Rockie exits the room. You look up at her and try to see what she wants. \"Um, Rockie? What exactly are you doing here?\" She looks down at you as she walks. \"I was just bored and had nothing to do, so I wanted to visit my sister. I see she's still hard at work.\" Again with the sarcasm. Guess Kiki's always been like that. \"Now how can we have a little fun?\" With that Rockie.....</span></div></div>",

She watches as this girl heads to her desk and sits down. She heads to a corner where no one will notice her, and without warning you are both consumed by smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoke clears you're not being held by Rockie, but by a vampire girl. She looks down at you and smiles while putting her finger to her lips. She stuffs you in her cleavage and walks over to the dragoness. Then, in an act of what you'd call lunacy, she grabs a cup of water from the desk and throws it right in the dragon girl's face. You can see the anger in her eyes as the vampire turns and runs. She stays ahead enough of the dragon to duck away somewhere. There is another flash and some smoke, which reveals Rockie once again. She then peeks out from her hiding spot in time to see the dragoness blow a puff of fire at the real vampire girl who Rockie was impersonating. Her clothes catch fire and she runs around like crazy while Rockie laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what was that about?\" you ask. Rockie looks down with a grin. \"It was about fun, thats what!\" You have a feeling this girl could be a handful. She leaves her hiding place and resumes her stroll.

Rockie looks down on you and smiles. \"She is? I'll go introduce myself!\" You suddenly feel yourself being lifted into the air. Rockie places you on a desk and continues toward Mazee. \"No! Wait!\" you call out to the tanuki as Mazee walks away and she follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the desk trying to keep your cool. Rockie might just ruin your day here. If she puts Mazee in a bad mood you'll be dealing with it later. Your fears seem to be unfounded, however, as you see Mazee coming back. There's no sign of Rockie though. Mazee walks up to you and you greet her. \"Uh, hey Mazee. Did you happen to see a tanuki girl by any chance?\" She just shakes her head. \"No, why do you ask?\" You don't know what Rockie's planning, but at least she hasn't done anything yet. \"Well she's kind of a prankster, and I was afraid she was going to try something.\" you explain.

There's a familiar puff of smoke and when it clears you see that you're no longer kissing Mazee. You're currently engulfed in Rockie's lips, and have your lips pressed against them. Before you can break the kiss, you hear a yell. \"Tim!!!\" You stumble away from Rockie and look over to find Mazee looking your way with fire in her eyes. When you look up at Rockie she grins and proceeds to make her exit. You feel the booming as Mazee stomps her way over to you.

Perhaps I should go carnivore right now!\" Mazee opens her mouth wide and shows you her enormous, terrifying teeth. You didn't think Mazee would actually eat you, but thanks to Rockie, Mazee was mad at you, she'd probably consider it. Mazee even sticks out her tongue and waves it around. You're sweating in fear. If you survive this, you're gonna make that tanuki into a coonskin hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Mazee closes her mouth. \"I could eat you, I should eat you, but that would be a little extreme. You are my boyfriend, for now anyway. But since you locked lips with that tanuki tramp.

No, I'm not going to eat him, I just need to scare him a little. Oh who am I kidding? We're gonna scare him a lot!\" She laughs a little at that last statement. You're really in for it.

These were the twins Brianna and Cameron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna was a black and white furred rat with long white hair and was built like most of her sisters. She was identifiable by her yellow jacket and skirt. Brianna was one of the sisters you fear the most. Not only did she eat humans, but she came up with gross ways to do so. The woman experimented with different and disgusting recipes that were so bizarre only wererats would eat them. You almost threw up when you saw her eat humans wrapped up in spaghetti coated with mustard. She was already licking her lips upon seeing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other wererat was Brianna's twin sister Cameron. Cameron looked almost identical to Brianna except her hair was longer and she had a black heart shaped birthmark around her eye and wore an orange outfit instead. You remembered Cameron worked as a hair stylist and she always talked about giving you a \"makeover\". The first time she told you this, she had scissors in her hands, which really terrified you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh,\" says Cameron as she looks you over. \"Looks like someone could use a bath. Don't worry Timmy. I've got some new makeup ideas to try out on you. After all, humans should look as good as they taste.\" Cameron smiles wickedly but then Brianna butts in and pushes her sister to the side. \"No fair Cameron. I've got some recipes I want to try out on him. I think I'll stuff him in a donut and dunk it in slime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're more scared than ever and it doesn't help that Kimberley is shaking you in her hand. \"I have an idea,\" says Kimberley. \"Why don't we let Tim choose his next torturer.\" Mazee smiles and nods her head. \"Well Tim, who do you think deserves to give you your comeuppance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was great.

Cameron claps her hands and then grabs you with an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright little guy, are you ready for your makeover?\" she says and grabs you hair in between her massive fingers. She musses it and pulls it a little until it hurts. When Mazee hears you squeal a little in pain she lets it go on for a little longer until she stops it. \"Alright thats enough of that. You can punish him, but you better not pull his hair out. I need him to still be cute when we're done.\" Cameron and the rest of her sisters all roll their eyes when Mazee says this, but she does let go of your hair. \"Don't worry, I'm just getting ready to work my magic.\" Work her magic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron opens a bag she brought with her and takes out a small bottle. You wonder what it is until she opens it and lets a large drop of it fall onto your head.

At least honey and sugar aren't disgusting like something Brianna would come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron throws you in her mouth and swishes you around.

Asia is once again a bigger girl like her sisters, and has a coat of fur that is white but with a hint of gray in some places. She smiles at you and holds you over her mouth, her tongue hanging out. Just as you think you're going in however she pulls you back to her face. \"I think you need to be tenderized.\" she says. On no. Asia had always been fond of torturing you with her body. Crushing, squishing, squeezing, she enjoys doing all of it to you. On one occasion Mazee was looking for you, only to find that you were wedged in between Asia's toes as she played with you. She told Mazee she was just tenderizing you for when she finally decided to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are brought back from your memories as Asia lays you flat on her palm. You look above you in time to see her other hand coming down on you. You are pressed between her two palms as she rubs it in for good measure.It sucks that they can do whatever they want as long as they don't kill you. You hope Mazee forgives you soon. When Asia removes her palm you are laying there gasping for breath. \"Aw, feeling a little beat? Well we still have more to do!\" she says with a laugh. You are then dropped to the floor. You land with a dull thud and sit up. All around you you see the feet of the many gigantic wererats, but Asia's feet are the closest. Before you can run her toes are upon you and you are being tossed and scrunched among them. You hear the other girls giggling at your pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the toe torture ends Asia plucks you from ground and raises you up. You are suddenly dropped into the softness of her ample breasts. For a fleeting moment you feel the comfort of the furry pillows, but that ends as she squeezes them together. You are squished and squeezed as she works her boobs all around. After the chaos you are picked up by your leg and removed from the squishy prison. You see that you are facing Mazee's last two sisters, Freda and Ricki. Freda has dark brown fur and is smaller than her sisters. She's not thin but she's certainly not as big as the rest of them. She has a penchant for handling you roughly. Unlike the crushing torture of Asia though, Freda tosses you around and handles you like a rag doll.She might use you as a hacky sack or simply play catch with you. The other one, Ricki, has pure whit fur and is built more like the rest of her sisters. She thinks you should be eaten like the rest, but also thinks that you have your uses. To her, humans should be used for pleasure and then eaten. At one time she actually almost had you down her pants before Mazee walked in. She always tries to convince her sisters of the pleasure you can get from a human. Although you think she'd be crazy to try anything like that right now. Who grabs you?  </span></div></div>",

Before you can think too long though Freda snatches you up quite roughly. \"Hey! I wanted to go next!\" Ricki protests. Freda merely sticks her tongue out at her sister. \"Sorry sis, but you're too slow!\" she says and then turns her attention to you. \"I wanna play with our little toy. Besides, I think he'll be glad to spend some time with a young lady, right little guy?\" Freda is the youngest of the sisters, and all six of the other wererats give a huff. Mazee in particular looks annoyed. It doesn't really help that she's older than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention is brought back to Freda when she gives you a vigorous shake. \"Eyes on me Timmy. We're gonna have some fun. How about a game of catch?\" Uh oh. The next thing you know she tosses you up and your flying through the air. You plummet down and land in her waiting hands. Up and down, up and down. This goes on as she continues her game. You start to feel queasy and hope that she gets bored soon. On your next trip down however she takes her hands away and you begin to panic. You're going to hit the floor! Freda smiles at you and quickly turns around and brings up the heel of her foot. You hit it and bounce back up into the air. She turns back around and continues using you as a hackey sack. Not only are you queasy, but now you're sore all over. Especially after what Asia put you through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Freda decides to stop. As you fall down she leans forward a little and lets you land in her cleavage. Once again the soft feeling gives you a second of comfort. She's not as big as her sisters, this area included, but she still has a nice rack. However you are yanked out and held out in front of your tormentor. She holds you by your hands and begins twisting and turning you like a doll. \"Haha! You're really fun Timmy!\" she says to you with a grin. Then she leans in close. \"But thats all you are. A toy and food!\" She flashes her teeth with this statement. She immediately brightens up and turns to her sisters. \"Okay! Guess my turn's over! Here ya go!\" With that she....</span></div></div>",

You can see that you're headed straight for Ricki, who catches you with glee. When she has you she holds you in her palm. \"Hey there Tim, guess its my turn.\" she says as she eyes you over. You look up at her nervously as she licks her lips. She looks hungry, in more ways than one. She's always said that you and all humans can be used for pleasure before eating. The only thing you can count on right now is that Mazee won't let her try anything. Sure, shes mad at you, but there's no way she'll let another woman have her way with you. That's what got her upset in the first place. You try to assure yourself of this until you hear Asia. \"Hey Maze, whats that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Mazee look away as her sister points at something. The second she does Ricki stuffs you in her bra. The material of her bra is pressing on your back and your front is squashed into her furry breast. You can hear the wererats on the outside talking. \"Uh oh, I think I dropped him.\" Ricki says. \"Well look for him, he won't try to run from me. He knows I still love him.\" Mazee responds. You hear the girls walking around and curse to  yourself. Ricki's hiding you! You want to call out but your face is full of her breast fur. Then you hear her say something. \"You guys keep looking, I have to use the bathroom.\" Uh oh. She's trying to get you alone to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your captor walking and then hear the bathroom door open. After a couple of seconds the door is locked and you are pulled out from the bra. \"Did you enjoy your stay?\" Ricki asks you. You look at her and answer. \"No, and I think you should take me back to Mazee.\" She merely smiles at you and licks you. \"But its technically still my turn. I need to punish you.\" You struggle in her grip. \"I know what you're trying to do! Mazee's the only girl for me, now let me go!\" Ricki just shakes her head. \"Tsk tsk tsk. You should have thought about that before you kissed that tanuki. Now lets get started shall we?\" She begins to take of her shirt as you watch. You feel bad but you can't help but stare, even if you don't want this. What happens?</span></div></div>",

Knowing that this is your chance you yell towards the door. \"Hey! Its me Tim! Ricki's got me in here!\" You know that its a long shot, since six out of the seven girls here don't like you. In a rare instance however you get lucky and a voice speaks from outside the bathroom. \"Tim?\" Its Mazee! Thank God! \"Ricki, open this door right now!\" she says loudly. Even if she's mad at you there's no way she'd let her sister have her way with you. You shoot Ricki a triumphant look and she stares down on you in frustration. In a defiant move she reaches for you again but the door begins shaking. \"If you don't open this door I'm going to knock it down!\" Mazee yells. Sensing the danger Ricki pulls back and starts putting her clothes back on. She doesn't want to face her older sister's wrath when she's this mad. \"Okay, I'm coming!\" she calls out. While she does she gives you a look that says you won't get away next time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finishes Ricki carries you over and opens the door. Standing there is Mazee with her arms folded. \"Give him here, now!\" she says and grabs you. Even after saving you she snatches you up a little roughly. Guess she's still kind of upset with you. \"What have I told you about this Ricki?\" she says. Her sister just sighs before looking her in the face. \"Sorry Maze.\" she says. Mazee just grunts in frustration before turning and walking away with you in hand. You look back and see Ricki looking at you with lust still in her eyes. You definitely know she'll try again in the future. Its not the first time Mazee's caught her in the act. It seems that as long as nothing actually happens Mazee will always forgive her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and collapse on your back on the palm of your girlfriend as she carries you to the main room. Looking up your view is filled with her gigantic breasts which sway as she walks. You smile a little as you watch them until Mazee looks down at you. \"Why do you look so relaxed?\" she asks. \"You're not off the hook just yet.\" You groan when she tells you this, prompting her to tap you on the head to hush you. When Ricki returns as well Mazee makes an announcement. </span></div></div>",

I don't want him distracting you again. Besides. I have a few tasks for him anyway.\" She said in an Annoyed tone. Mazee did her best to hide her disappointment and left the room. Lexy loomed over you with a smirk. She effortlessly plucked you from the chair. \"You sure can take a beating, can't you?\" She said in an oddly cheerful tone. In a puff of smoke, you found yourself back in Rockie's palm. \"You!\" You shouted before a finger covered your mouth. \"I know you're mad. I'm sorry, I just couldn't resist.\" She said with a grin. Slowly she removed the finger from your lips. \"You jerk! Now she thinks I was cheating on her. You saw how she acts when she's mad at me. Now I'll probably get it worse when she gets back.\" You vented as you tried to make her realize just how serious the effects of this pranks were on you. \"Yeesh! For someone who's supposedly your girlfriend, you'd think she'd trust you a bit more. Or at least not attack you like that.\" She said in a matter of fact tone. \"She gets jealous.\"  You explained in a grouchy tone, getting annoyed that she make such comments on your relationship. \"Clearly. I'm not sure about the normal days of your relationship, but if you ask me, little bouts like that are not a sign of a healthy relationship. Especially with someone like you who could die from them.\" Her tone and expression  actually seemed to change to genuine concern as she said this. \"Y-you don't know her. Mazee is probably one of the sweetest people I know. We have our rough patches, but what relationship doesn't?\" Rockie walked into an empty room nearby and placed you on a desk. \"Usually they aren't this fatal for one partner, even with monsters. I heard that she did something similar when one of the girls hit on you and took advantage of your size. Was that one your fault?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face turned red. \"I...\" To be fair that one actually was a good point. \"And I'd hate to imagine how a break up from either end would go for you.\" She glanced out the door before looking back at you. \"Look... I know she has her faults, but she's still the sweetest person I know. We love each other.\" You said still thinking of the good times you spent with her. Rockie seemed to accept your reasoning. \"Okay then. I guess I can't judge it on one or two instances. Still think about what I said. Someone that jealous is probably not the best choice for someone so.... Well someone of your stature.\"</span></div></div>",

She walks along the street for a while until she comes across a shop and enters. \"What are we doing here?\" you asks. Rockie taps your head with a finger and explains. \"This is where I work. Its kind of boring so I figure having a human buddy would help keep me entertained.\" You look at her and try to make sense of this. \"If you're supposed to be working then why were you at my work?\" She shrugs. \"I was on break and decided to visit Kiki. It was just luck that I got myself a sidekick for the day.\" Sidekick? What does she plan on using you for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour conversation is cut short when someone suddenly whacks Rockie on the back of her head. \"You're late!\" This new monster says. Upon further view you see that its another tanuki. Unlike Kiki and Rockie she has brown fur. She's pudgy and dressed in casual clothes. She's also wearing an apron over her large belly. Rockie rubs the back of her head. \"Jeez, I'm not that late, I was visiting my sister!\" The new tanuki sighs and then spots you. \"Who's this? You look up at her and introduce yourself.\"Hi. My name's Tim. I work at the Daily Tombstone with Rockie's sister. I don't really know why she brought me here.\" The chubby tanuki offers you her finger, which you shake. \"No one can really figure out this girl. My name's Tammy. I'm Rockie and Kiki's cousin. This shop here is mine and I'm letting Rockie work here. Speaking of which, its time for her to get back to work!\" She stares at Rockie as she says this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rockie sighs and grabs an apron. \"Jeez you're just like Kiki, no fun at all.\" Tammy folds her arms. \"I have a business to run. Besides, if you want to go there, then you and your sister are more alike than you think. Neither one of you seems to take your jobs seriously.\" Even though they're supposed to be a boss and employee it really feels like a family squabble. Not a bad one though, just one of those little arguments families often have. Tammy seems a lot more responsible than her cousins. Tammy turns back to you and picks you up. \"So what exactly are you doing with Rockie?\" You explain about your day with Kiki and Tammy shakes her head. \"I swear, those two. Opposite personalities but the same work ethic.\" You ask Tammy what its like to own her own store. \"Its great, I love making money and it feels good knowing I built my own place from the ground up. This place started as a little shack, but I turned it into what you see now and I'm always waiting for the next opportunity to expand.\" She sounds really proud of her work. She's so unlike Kiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Rockie's working you have no way of getting back to the building. You were supposed to be with Kiki, but she probably forgot about you anyway. Guess you should just wait for Rockie to get off work and take you back. How does the time go by? </span></div></div>",

You shrug and smile. \"I might as well try to be useful while I'm here.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you spend your time by the cash register while Rockie rings up customers. All you do really do is greet them and tell them to have a nice day. Even so, they really seem to like you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So,\" you ask nervously. \"What's my mission for today.\" Lexi lets out an almost malicious sounding purr and lowers her head to face you. \"I have an idea Tim. Beth is always on guard duty during the day when everyone's already here. It's boring. Nobody tries to break in during the day and she rarely sees any action. Not like Fate.\" \"Uh yeah?\" you ask not liking where this is going. \"So,\" says Lexi. \"Maybe you could join her. Give her an extra set of eyes, maybe keep her some company. What do you say?\" You're not so sure about this but it was your job to assist the monsters. \"Uh, can't I assist Fate instead?\" \"Fate isn't supposed to be here for an hour,\" says Lexi in an annoyed tone. \"Get to it Tim. If it weren't for our deal I could go carnivore right this second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you say. \"It isn't fieldwork but a job's a job. See you later boss.\" As you walk under the door you see that it's not closed properly. \"Uh-oh,\" you say. \"Lexi must've forgot to close the door.\" You jump up and push the oversized door a few times and manage to close it. But inside the office, Lexi's eyes practically pop out of her head as she grits her teeth and groans in pain. She turns around and sees you shut the door right on the end of her tail. \"Well that figures.\" She mumbles right before she screams in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure it would be the best to run. You were nervous to work with Beth. She was a behemoth, a type of monster you thought there was only one of in Jewish myth. There were many different interpretations of what one looked like but you knew what one looked like when you saw Beth. Beth was a monster that resembled a hippo woman but with the thick skin of a dragon or dinosaur. She and Fate, the other guard in the building were the biggest monsters that worked for the Daily Tombstone, (disregarding Lexi who could be bigger, but since she never stood up on two legs you weren't too sure). Given how most of the monsters in the building were of above average height for monsters, that was saying something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were afraid to work with Beth because like Blake she was another monster who thought you should be their boyfriend's instead of Mazee's. But Beth was worse than Blake because her idea of getting men to fall for her was through physical abuse. You knew for a fact that she wore a skimpy dominatrix's outfit underneath her guard's uniform and she brought a whip to work. If she wasn't doing that, she was playing with you in her mouth like a jolly rancher and if it wasn't <i>that</i> she was using you as a seat cushion and giving you a front row seat to that skull tattoo on her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake because Beth has beaten you several times before to try and turn you onto her. What's scary is that Kiki told you there was another human boy Beth had her eye on and she wound up killing him. Though Kiki might've been telling you a cruel joke. Fortunately the guard's office isn't that far from Lexi's and you walk in through the door to see the behemoth giantess Beth looking at several video screens as she was atop a chair that looked too small for her. The behemoth lets out a yawn and wipes her eyes. Not that one could blame her for being bored, it was true. Nothing happened during the day that would attract the attention of security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to Beth's sharp toes and yell up to her. \"Hey Beth!\" you yell. \"It's me, Tim!\" Beth looks down and has to roll back her chair to see you past her large breasts and belly. Once she sees you, she gives you those bedroom eyes of hers and bears her sharp hippo-like teeth. \"Hi there Timmy,\" she says. \"You're up early today.\" Beth picks you up by the shirt and you're struggling as she holds you in front of her massive snout. \"So, are you and Mazee still dating?\" You nod your head and Beth sighs in disappointment. \"What could you possibly see in a rat. I'm twice as big as she is. Say little man, how about we start the day off with some fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" you mumble. \"Shouldn't we be more focused on work.\" Beth lets out a sigh. \"You sound just like Fate. That gargoyle girl seriously needs a boyfriend. Besides, who's going to break into the building in broad daylight? Don't worry little man, I know just how we can get our kicks.\" You start to sweat. The behemoth woman was skipping right to the hard love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Beth decides to...</span></div></div>",

You trip and then her tongue makes contact with you, and then she licks you right then. You find it absolutely disgusting as she just licked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you taste just good for a human. I won't eat a human that tastes good. I rather get down and dirty with that human.

Don't even think about it!

Besides, I'll bet she never has fun with you like this.\" Beth lets go as you and you fall screaming onto her tongue before the behemoth woman snaps her mouth shut. You start to slip on her enormous tongue. It's pitch black in Beth's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the first time you've been in the behemoth's city sized maw. One of Beth's methods of flirting with human men was to play with them in her mouth. Suddenly Beth's tongue begins to shift and lifts you up towards the top of her mouth and pushes you against the rood as you scream. You even swallow some of Beth's saliva as you cough and hold your neck. You slide down the tongue and are so drenched in saliva that you try to swim up the tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Beth tilts her head as she lets out a pleasured moan. \"Oh, oh, having fun in there Tim?\" You try to yell at the behemoth but you're mouth is too full of saliva as you slid to the end of Beth's city sized tongue and are wedged into Beth's front teeth. You hold onto her gums as Beth licks you and even pulls off your shirt and pants. \"Hey!\" you yell. Beth tilts her head back and pushes you into one of her monstrous canine teeth and the behemoth proceeds to swallow your clothes as you let out a groan. But you can't move, Beth's tongue is so heavy, unsurprising given the size of the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the day security guard giggles to herself. \"Now the real fun can begin Timmy. Think now you'll consider dumping that wererat.\" \"Keep dreaming hippo face!\" But Beth just giggles and starts shaking her head as you're tossed about on her tongue. If this is how she treats humans she has a crush on, you'd hate to see what she does to humans she hates. You hope this mouth play is over soon.

But you weren't hurt, but still, it was painful. She giggled above you and slowly, and carefully grind you with her butt. You tried to scream, but it was muffled under her massive cheek.

Fate is too focused on her work.\" \"You rather I stick you with Beth?\" You let out a gulp and shake your head. \"No boss. I'll be off.\" You run under the door as Lexi lets out a sigh and starts to lick her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, everyone is already leaving to go home but you're walking towards the guard room. Suddenly you feel tremors and then look up to see your girlfriend Mazee with her friend (and your apartment) Willa the bunyip. \"Come on Tim,\" says Willa as she bends down on her knees. \"It's quitting time mate.\" Willi stretches out her pouch but you shake your head. \"Actually girls, I have the nightshift with Fate.\" Willa lets out a scoff as Mazee picks you up and pets you on the head. \"Try to be careful baby. Fate has the most dangerous job in the building.\" \"Well your boyfriend can hang out with that gargoyle until the cows come home.\" \"Don't be like that Willa,\" says Mazee. \"Fate's okay. It's her mom I'm not too crazy about.\" With that the wererat giantess kisses you. \"See you later baby.\" \"You know how to get back in,\" says Willa. \"Just don't wake me up when you get back in me pouch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee puts you on the ground before both she and Willa leave. As you're walking to the guard room you stop because there are even larger tremors than those made by Mazee and Willa. You look up to see that behemoth Beth, the day guard. Beth gives you a lustful smile and even blows a kiss before that dragon skinned hippopotamus walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh, while Fate wasn't a social monster, she didn't flirt with you or try to steal you from Mazee like Beth did. According to Beth, Fate's never been on a date in her life. No male monster would get near her because Fate's mother Destiny is a prison warden and didn't let the fact that her daughter was an adult stop her from being stupidly overprotective. Regardless of species, Destiny wouldn't let any man even be in the same room as Fate. The last man who thought about asking Fate out changed his mind because Destiny held him at <i>gunpoint</i>. Of course, you heard Destiny had Fate out of wedlock so this behavior doesn't sound too surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the guard room and walk under the door to find the massive purple gargoyle was already sitting in her chair, eyes glued to the security screens. \"Hey Fate.\" You call out to her. Fate doesn't answer and you let out a groan. \"It's gonna be another one of those nights.\" As you walk forward, Fate lowers her tail for you to climb up. She did this so she could tend to you without losing focus. \"Someone seriously needs to get laid.\" You think to yourself as you get on Fate's tail and she puts you on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate has that same stoic look on her face as she looks at the screens. Nothing escaped her eagle eyes. \"So, Fate,\" you say trying to start a conversation. \"Anything good on monster television? All the human networks suck.\" But Fate doesn't answer or even look at you and you turn to the screens. You're about to walk forward but Fate simply uses a claw to scratch a line in the table in front of you. The last time you worked with her, you broke three monitors and she didn't seem to forget it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You wish Fate was more social. She wasn't malicious, but she wasn't much fun to be around. That gargoyle was married to her job, just like her mom. You decide to kick back and relax, it was going to be a long night.</span></div></div>",

As Wade is dizzy, Fate puts down the jar and then looks down on you. \u201cI told Mom everything,\u201d she says. \u201cBut neither of us can leave our post. She\u2019s going to come in next morning to pick up the prisoner.\u201d You\u2019re suddenly very afraid. \u201cWarden Destiny?\u201d you ask. \u201cHere?\u201d Fate lets out a sigh. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom\u2019s not some hard hearted fiend. She just has a very stressful job. In fact, she\u2019s very fond of humans. But there is one word you must never say in front of her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d you ask. Fate looks around before telling you the word. \u201cDemona.\u201d \u201cWhat does your Mom have against a gargoyle from a TV show?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just say Mom wasn\u2019t amused with her character design.\u201d You decide to take Fate\u2019s word for it, but the idea of you being face to face with a prison warden. You have no criminal record yourself, but this woman sounded like she ran a tight ship. Wade gives a sour look and taps on the jar but Fate holds onto it tight. It was going to be one long night.</span></div></div>",

Fate doesn't turn away from the video screens but it's obvious that Wade's words got to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude,\" you say. \"Do you really think you should be trying to piss off a 1000ft tall gargoyle?\" \"Shut up monster lover!\" yells Wade before her turns to Fate. \"You listening to me Angela?\" \"My name isn't Angela,\" says Fate in annoyance. \"It's Fate.\" \"Well I think it would be more accurate if you removed the last letter you bloated eggplant.\" \"I know I'm not the thinnest gargoyle,\" says Fate. \"Quite frankly I don't mind.\" \"Oh yeah?\" asks Wade. \"I'll bet the reason your gut is so big is so people don't notice your ugly hairstyle.

It wasn't a good idea to be too close to an angry gargoyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Mom was torturing you,\" says Fate. \"You definitely had it coming. She actually likes humans. You're just\" \"Yeah right. I'll bet she's not even a real redhead!\" yells Wade. \"You and your stupid monster kind attacked first when that mummy friend of yours wrecked my car. A guy's gotta have a patriotic duty to exterminate a lower life form like you. You monsters are nothing but trouble. You overgrown fruit bats are the worst of the bunch.

No wonder Mom is always angry.\" Wade gestures with his hand as if to say \"Blah, blah, blah.\" Fate looks at the screens to try and take her mind off of Wade. \"Ignore him Fate,\" she mumbles to herself. \"You just have to hold him until morning and then Mom will take it from here. Maybe this time she'll finally execute him. No, that's a cruel thing to say. Just ignore him. Remember Tim is right near you. Remember your training soldier.\" It becomes clear Fate is doing all she can so Wade doesn't piss her off too badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna be a long night.\" You say to yourself.</span></div></div>",

Her eyes were yellow and slitted, like a cat's, while two horns protruded from her forehead, and her nails were long and sharp  as knives, and painted red, while a long devil's tail with a heart shaped tip dangled from her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor clothing, she wore a black business suit and skirt that showed off her smooth legs. There was only one sort of creature this woman could be. A succubus. You begin to tremble in fear.

Bea even blows a kiss at you and you jump out of the way. You knew all too well where this was going and you didn't like it. \"No! No! No! I'm already in a relationship with a monster. Mazee Robinson is the only girl for me. Understand?\" Bea actually looks in disappointment. \"Oh,\" she says as her tail and horns droop down. \"I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of relief. This monster was a flirter. You get enough of that from Blake and Beth and honestly you didn't want another.

Maybe even a hippogriff?\" You shake your head and smile. \"She's the most beautiful wererat I've ever seen.\" Bea's jaw drops as she looks at you in disgust. \"You're kidding me? A wererat? You're dating a dirty rodent that eats toxic waste? You're sick.\" You let out a laugh. \"Funny, that's what Willa tells Mazee about dating someone as small as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBea gives a disgruntled look. Obviously she thought you were implying she was less attractive than a wererat. You're confused because Mazee isn't a fraction as ugly as most people think wererats are. \"So, uh Bea. Shouldn't we go on with the tour.\" Bea then realizes something and nods her head. \"Oh-okay. For a minute I forgot I was learning to be a journalist.\" You let out a smile and start walking away, obviously forgetting that Bea could cover more ground than you in less time. \"Right this way Bea. Thanks for not eating my soul.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't notice it, but Bea keeps looking down on you with lust in her eye, very common for a succubus?</span></div></div>",

Lexi says I'm a great motivator.\" \"Oh really?\" asks Bea. \"Yep,\" you say proudly. \"She says every time I get assigned to a coworker, they have to be ten times more careful and work harder.\" You didn't realize that Lexi didn't mean that as a compliment but Bea rolls her eyes at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk on ahead, you hear stomping and step back. A monster was coming forward. But then you see the monster's shadow and realize that this monster is Mazee, your giant wererat girlfriend. She had just arrived at work. \"Hi Mazee!\" you yell up at the giantess wererat. Bea looks in surprise and sees Mazee. \"That's your girlfriend?\" she asks in confusion. The 500ft wererat looks down and smiles as she shows you her teeth. \"Hi Tim,\" she says in a lustful tone. \"Sorry I'm late baby.\" Mazee picks you up off the ground and puckers her lips to kiss you.

Monsters took a lot of looking to take in the sight of, of course, just due to sheer size, but it took you a moment to discern a species. And when you do, you're still not entirely sure what you're seeing. It heavily resembles a...hyena? But it looks a bit more brute-ish, with a darker fur and a bear-like face. She was quite tall, outshining Lexi at 900 Feet tall. Her body was fairly well defined, something you could tell despite the fur. A fact made more easily visible because of how naked she was, although whether or not she was technically naked was debatable due to the whole fur thing. She wasn't particularly 'curvy', but she looked <i>strong</i>, like she could easily tear apart any monster her size. You're really not sure what she is, but it's far too late to contemplate that as she suddenly snatches you up before you have time to realize she'd even seen you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding you up to her face, the strange creature grins wickedly, her sharp teeth showing. Her large, single eye, which you only just noticed, stared at you intently, and you nearly wet yourself. \"A human, eh? Are you sure you should be walking around unattended? It can be awfully...dangerous, to be caught off guard...\" she says, licking her lips. You gulp. \"I'm, uh... Tim, my name's Tim...\" you say with a hint of nervousness. \"I'm here to give you a tour of the building...and, uh, I couldn't help but ask...what are exactly are you? I've never seen a monster like you before...\" The strange hyena-like creature lets out a laugh. \"Yeah, you wouldn't. My family is somewhat...seclusive. But if you really must know, human, I'm a Nandi Bear.\" Ah. Everything clicked in your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a monster that resembled a cross between a hyena and a bear because that's exactly what a Nandi Bear was. It was on par with the Loch Ness monster in terms of how much it actually existed, but it was...not nearly as popular as the Loch Ness monster in that way, for sure. Only Nandi Bear's were supposedly vicious creatures, and you didn't really want to be face to face with one...which is exactly where you were, right now. Except it was a giant monster. And you had to give it a tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering, you slowly begin to speak. \"S-so...shall we begin?\" you ask nervously, and the monster lets out a chuckle. \"Go on, 'Tim'. You're the tour guide, after all. Tell me where we're going first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some walking, and you nervously explaining certain areas of the tower to her while trying to hide how secretly worried you were, you learned her name was Brandy. Heh. Brandy the Nandi Bear. It rhymed. Although you wouldn't point that out to her, for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven longer after that, you work up the courage to ask a question you weren't really sure you wanted to ask. But if you don't ask, you'll spend the whole time wondering. So mustering up all your strength, you ask her \"...Brandy, what is your opinion on, uh...humans?\" you ask quietly, and her large, single eye squints as she considers the question, wondering how to respond. Finally, after a few moments of silence, with you practically shaking in fear as you wondered what she'd say, she says...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Konia startled everyone. I mean, there aren't a lot of monsters in Fearfield with more than one head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi just growls at you and step back. \"If you hadn't answered my riddle correctly,\" says your sphinx boss. \"I'm have you for lunch.\" Lexi even snaps her jaws to emphasize her point as you're shaking. She even shakes her tail. \"You really outdid yourself this time, Tim,\" says Lexi. \"I don't know whether or not to fire you or to shoot you.\" You actually sweat at that. You definitely didn't want to be fired by Lexi but she's just so mad right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, then Lexi moves her eyes as if she's deep in thought and pins you to the ground with one of her claws. She has it dangerously close to her neck, like a cat playing with a mouse it intends to kill. \"But then again,\" says Lexi. \"Everyone deserves a second chance. It recently occurred to me that having only two guards, neither of which have the same shift, is inefficient. So I recently hired two more security guards. One for the day shift and one for the night shift. They coincidentally start work today at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi then picks you up and holds you in front of her face as you grunt. \"And it's just as well. Fate can't work the night shift tonight because she's helping her mother with some pest control and Beth can't work the day shift. Poor dear caught a nasty flu and couldn't come in today. Of course, the new guards will need some guidance. Your choice. Day shift or night shift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even know what the new guards looked like or what species they were, but this was your only chance to save your job. Which shift should you cover?</span></div></div>",

And in walked who you assumed was the new employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new employee was an 845 foot tall female vampire like Tara. She had chalk white skin, blood red lips, and blood red eyes. You saw that she was completely bald, leaving her pointy ears exposed. You also noticed the she had an even bigger hourglass figure then Aurelia. She had ZZZ-Cup boobs and an ass that could fill a couch. She was wearing a tight silver dress with a short skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim, this is Violet von Westbell. Please Violet, have a seat.\" Lexi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet nodded and sat in a chair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...only for the chair to completely shatter, sending her onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry.\" Violet said in a German accent. She sat in the other chair, but that chair shattered too. She stood up, only to slip on a piece of wood and fall head first into Lexi's desk, spilling Lexi's coffee onto Lexi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, another jinx.\" Lexi said. \"I was going to orient you, but I'll let Tim do that. Please get out before you wreck my office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet looked down and saw you. She picked you up by the shirt, but your shirt ripped and sent you falling into Violets cleavage. Violet reached down to get you, but slipped on the same piece of wood and stumbled backwards, breaking through Lexi's door. Lexi sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes I wonder if it's worth getting out bed.\" Lexi mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Violet finally caught her balance and pulled you out. Just then, Mazee walked up and saw you two. She saw your ripped shirt, looked at Violet, and snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you again, Violet.\" Mazee said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mazee.\" Violet said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked between the two. \"You know her?\" You asked Mazee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Back in High School.\" Mazee said, grabbing you from Violets hand. \"Violet is, by and large, the unluckiest monster in the country. She's a vampire who's allergic to blood. In her senior year, she had an accident with chemicals that left her permanently bald. After college, a witch cursed her with an hourglass figure that's still growing for no reason at all. She gets rained on even if there's no clouds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like the universe itself is out to get me.\" Violet said. Then she turned to look at the office, but her boobs hit Aurelia, who was passing by with a cup of coffee. The scalding hot coffee spilled into Violet's cleavage, making her scream and jump, which made her hit her head on the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Mazee said. \"So, Violet, you want Tim to give you a tour now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her head in pain, Violet said...</span></div></div>",

For clothes she wore what looked like a belly dancer outfit, with a red silk tube top that exposed her stomach, pants and shoes, with a veil covering her face from the nose down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there.\" She said in a friendly tone. \" I'm Jasmine.

Two problems I'd like to sort out.\" Jasmine levitates slightly in the air and smiles down at you as she leans forward. \"Oh. Tell me. I haven't granted a wish in a donkey's age. What is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about the two non predators in the news building that have caused you and Mazee the most trouble and give a smile. \"You see Jasmine. There are two monsters in this building who are too interested in me than I'd like. They're smitten and won't leave me alone.\" Jasmine blinks and then twirls her tail. \"But, if you have two girls fighting over you, what's the problem?\" \"I already have a girlfriend. She's a beautiful wererat.\" Jasmine lowers her ears in disbelief. \"You're dating a rodent. I would've thought you could do better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point. These two won't leave me alone. I'm afraid if it keeps up, Mazee might break up with me.\" \"Oh,\" says the neko genie. \"I see. Well, as you know, genies can't make anyone fall in love with anyone else.\" You let out a groan and slap yourself on the forehead. \"But there isn't a rule about making someone fall out of love. Just tell me the targets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're excited because you finally had a way of getting rid of Blake and Beth. \"The first one is the entertainment critic, Blake, this bit fat weretiger. She never wears clothes and she's out to get me to marry her. One time she put me in a cage. The second is Beth, one of the security guards, a big hulking behemoth. She shows her love through torture. My back is still sore from that whip and I keep seeing that skull tattoo on her ass in my nightmares. I'll be sure to stay away from hippo monsters from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine crosses her arms at that last line. \"Hippo monsters aren't so bad. One of my best friends is a bahamut. But I see where you're getting at. Just say the word and your problems are over.\" You smile because you know just what to wish for. \"I wish that Blake and Beth would leave me alone.\" Jasmine squees and spins her ponytail. \"Oh boy! It's been too long since I granted a wish. I hope I get this right Tim. Alright. Shazam!\" Jasmine snaps her fingers and the room fills with blue smoke to your confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn two different rooms, the spell was taking effect. In the guard room, Beth was with Fate, the other guard. As Beth was about to take a sip of coffee, she felt her head and begun to cough. Out of concern Fate gets up and taps Beth on the shoulder. \"Beth?\" asks Fate. \"Are you feeling alright?\" Fate coughs again as that same blue smoke from the spell blows out of her large mouth. \"Oh. I think this coffee is rotten. My head feels a little funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the cafeteria, Blake was with that Kiki, Lexi's secretary. Kiki was scarfing a plate of crullers as Blake was busy drawing pictures of you and her in pink pen as she smiled. Blake starts to feel lightheaded just like Beth and tries to get up but falls over on Kiki, only for the tanuki to push her to the side as the same blue smoke from the spell comes out of Blake's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Jasmine, Jasmine's eyes glow as she continues casting the spell until finally she snaps her fingers. \"It should be done now.\" She says. You really hope that you're rid of Beth and Blake stalking you from now on. But did Jasmine's spell do anything? She said she hadn't granted a wish in a long time.

This was it, you could finally enjoy Mazee without fear of Beth and Blake flirting with you. As if on cue, Blake walks right by. \"Blake!\" you yell. \"Hey Blake!\" You run in front of the tigress and she looks down at you before shrugging her shoulders. \"Hi Tim. Listen, I'm busy. I need to be at a movie opening, so, get lost would you.\" With that Blake walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you say. \"Thanks Jasmine. Now I'll never have to worry about stalkers again.\" Jasmine twirls her tail and lowers her ears as she twiddles her fingers. You really don't like how the neko genie hybrid is looking at you. \"Well,\" says Jasmine. \"There's one thing. The love couldn't be destroyed, so it relocated.\" \"Relocated?\" you ask in concern. \"But you said that genies couldn't make people fall in love with anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine mews and then nods her head. \"True. But this is a case where that rule is fudged slightly.

The look in Kiki's eyes is making you a little nervous. \"Do you think you can come with me for a second?\" the tanuki asks. Now this is strange. Usually you can't get Kiki to do anything, but now she's coming to you. Jasmine shrugs her shoulders. \"Well I guess I'll be on my way.\" she says and walks away. Before she leaves she gives you a knowing look. You think about that look and then look up Kiki. You think the smile she's wearing is familiar and then it hits you. Its the way Blake used to look at you! Kiki must have gotten Blake's love for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis revelation is cut short when Kiki reaches down and scoops you up in her paw. She begins to carry you away while glancing down at you every now and then. \"So...what do you need me for?\" you ask her. \"Oh, I just wanted you to help me with something.\" she answers. She arrives at her desk and sits down, setting you down as well. You look up at her as she looks down on you. \"Okay, so what did you need help with?\" you ask. \"Well I was just sitting here working,\" she starts. Working? You doubt that. She was probably slacking off. \"When all of a sudden I realized that I could really use your help.\" she continues. \"Okay, lets get started.\" you tell her. Immediately after you say his her giant paw returns to grab you. Then she deposits you into her cleavage and relaxes in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to climb out and stare upwards at the giant tanuki. \"Kiki, what are you doing?\" you ask. She rubs your head before answering. \"Just taking a little rest. I just ate so I should let it settle before I go back to work.\" she tells you. You feel like thats one of many excuses she's used to get out of work. Now she's just sitting there with you in her boobs, glancing down every so often. She doesn't even pay any mind to the people walking by. Now this is a strange feeling. She's actually paying attention to you, but only you. It makes sense though. She may have taken the love from those other two but she's still got her usual personality. Of course she'd express her feelings differently. All things aside though, you need to get out of this.

As you push down on them to try and force your way out you notice a smile on her face. \"Mmmm...Tim you little devil.\" she murmurs. What kind of dream is she having? Suddenly you feel yourself going down and see the desk getting closer. She's going to sleep on the desk! You brace yourself for impact as the soft cushions collide with the hard surface. You actually don't feel anything because they're so soft. As Kiki lays against her desk she smiles and even wags her tail a little. She might be in love with you but she's still all about being lazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you hear stomping and Lexi comes over. \"Kiki, wake-\" she begins before she spots you. \"Tim? What are you doing there?\" she asks. \"Well, long story short Kiki is in love with me. Now she's forcing me to take a nap with her!\" you explain. Lexi laughs out loud, but Kiki doesn't wake up. \"Look, can you help me out of here?\" you ask. Lexi chuckles before putting on a straight face. \"Actually, i think Kiki has been working pretty hard, so I'm gonna let her sleep for a while.\" she says. What an obvious lie! Kiki hasn't worked hard since the day you met her! Lexi turns to walk away as Kiki sleep talks some more. \"Timmy...you're so dreamy.\" she says. Lei stifles a laugh and heads back to her office. You grunt in frustration as  the giant tanuki sleeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon your predicament has just become an annoyance. Its not uncomfortable, since Kiki's breasts are so cushiony, its just something you figure you'll have to wait out. The waiting ends when Kiki raises herself up and stretches her arms. After letting out a yawn she looks around. Did she forget about you? You get your answer when she looks right at you and smiles softly. \"Hey Timmy, did you sleep well?\" she asks. \"Just great.\" you says sarcastically. She then pulls you free and sets you on the desk. As you stand she begins twirling her finger on the desk as if she's bored. It knocks you down every so often and she tickles your belly. Wow, she really is focused on you, even if she's still oblivious to everything else. When she's done her little game you notice the girls around you leaving. It must be closing time. Before you can go Kiki yawns and snatches you up. \"Time to head home.\" she says and stuffs you in her cleavage once again. Your cries are muffled as she walks to the exit. This is bad.

Her usually composed face is a little red, like she's blushing. As if she realizes this she quickly shakes it off and begins speaking. \"Ahem, hello Tim. How are you?\" she asks. She sounds calm, but you can tell she's a little eager to talk to you. It might seem like nothing, but you can spot these subtleties because its so out of character for her. \"I'm fine. What brings you here Fate?\" you respond. \"Oh, nothing. Just wanted to say hi.\" she says and walks away. When she does you see her face redden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess we know who got the love.\" Jasmine says. \"She was acting a little weird.\" you note. Then it hits you. Fate may love you now, but she's still Fate. She won't let her emotions control her, so you don't have to worry about her stealing you like Beth or Blake did. \"She seemed like a schoolgirl with a crush.\" Jasmine comments. When you think about it you wonder if Fate has much experience with liking guys. She seems like she doesn't worry about stuff like that and focuses on her job. You've also heard that her mom is pretty tough, so it's not strange to imagine she would keep the guys away. Just as you start feeling safe the rumbling returns and a shadow appears over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey again Tim. Are you done with this girl here?\" Fate says as she walk up. \"My name is Jasmine, and yes, we're about finished.\" Jasmine tells her. Before you can say anything she starts to walk away. \"Sorry if I caused you any trouble Tim.\" she says as she goes. \"What does she mean?\" Fate asks. \"Nothing.\" you answer. Fate then picks you up and places you on her palm. She starts to walk forward with you in hand, giving you a chance to observe her. Her face has a triumphant look, like she just made an accomplishment Then your eyes wander lower and see her massive chest just above you. She looks down and catches you staring, causing you to quickly look away. You look and see that she's also looking away, blushing once again. She really is like a girl with a crush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fate arrives at the guard station you see that Beth is there as well. \"Hey Beth.\" you say. She regards you with a quick look and then goes about her business. \"Hey Tim.\" she says. At least she's off your back. You turn your attention back to Fate, who has begun absentmindedly scratching your head. \"So uh, what did you bring me here for?\" you ask. Fate thinks for a second and then begins stammering. \"Well, I...\" she says. You figure she wanted to get you to herself but didn't think too far ahead of that. The moment is interrupted by Beth walking out. \"Well I guess I'll see you guys later.\" she says. It must be getting late, so Fate is taking over. She is the night guard after all.

That's when you turn and see Lexi walking into the room. Obviously she wasn't expecting to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim?\" asks Lexi. \"What are you doing here? I thought I asked you to watch the new intern?\" You mumble nervously and then Lexi sees that Fate has one eye on you. Fate quickly looks the other way as Lexi looks in confusion. \"Hey,\" says Lexi. \"What's going on? Isn't it Beth who's supposed to be all... I dunno crazy for you?\" \"Well Lexi,\" you say. \"One of the interns turned out to be half genie and I wished to be rid of my stalkers and well, it kinda...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take Lexi long to put two and two together and her eyes pop out of her head. She then cracks a smirk and lets out a purr. \"Oh,\" she says. \"I see. I see. Carry on. I want you to help Fate. She could always use an extra set of eyes.\" Lexi walks away and begins laughing to herself. Somehow you're worried because it doesn't look good for you. Lexi laughs to herself as she exits the guard room. It looks like she has a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too perfect. Too perfect. Warden Destiny doesn't like any man to so much as look at her daughter. When she finds out about Tim, she'll go ballistic. I'll finally be rid of him. Kiki, get Under Gloom on the phone. I've got an idea.\" What Lexi doesn't realize is that Kiki has just as much of a lovestruck look on her face as Fate does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the guardroom, you look at the screens. Fate is half focused on the monitors and half focused on you. She seems to be somewhat nervous, as if she isn't proud of this lovesickness. You doubted she even went on a date in her life. You then turn your head and see a photograph that catches your attention. It depicts Fate as a child with who you assume is her mother Destiny. From the looks of it, Destiny is a light blue skinned gargoyle, similar in appearance to her daughter, albeit much skinnier and has what appears to be reddish pink hair. You immediately become nervous because you realize exactly who her appearance reminds you of and it isn't someone particularly friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Fate,\" you say. \"Your Mom looks like somebody I've seen before, a long time...\" Fate lets out a sigh. \"Mom is perfectly aware of the resemblance, so please don't remind her.\" Either way, Destiny looks like a real hard case given her facial expression in the photograph. You heard from Mazee that Destiny was never in a good mood. If she found out about what was going on, spell or no spell, she'd hold you responsible. You heard that Fate hatched out of wedlock and Destiny didn't want Fate to make the same mistake she did. If Destiny thought you were trying to seduce her daughter, you were as good as dead. It was definitely going to be a long night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear your cellphone ring. \"Uh Fate, I need to take this call. Could you do me a favor and keep an eye on the screens.\" You run to a safe place and answer the phone. But who is it at the other end?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hello?\" you ask. \"Don't hello me you incubus!\" yells a female voice on the other side of the phone. \"You snake in the grass!\" You let out a gasp. That was probably Destiny. How the heck did she get your phone number? She sounded pretty angry. That's when it hit you. She found out about you and Fate. \"Uh,\" you mutter. \"It must be destiny, I mean, you! You must be Destiny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here Mertins,\" says Destiny, growing more and more angry by the second. \"I don't know how you seduced my Fate, but if you lay one hand on any part of my <i>angel</i>, I'LL ROAST YOU ALIVE!!\" You gulp at that thought. \"Now wait Destiny,\" you say. \"Ms. Sirtis. Let's not do anything rash. This was all an accident. Long story, it involved a half-genie and perhaps one little...\" \"You cast a spell on my daughter?!\" yells Destiny even more angry than before. \"I knew it! I certainly didn't raise my angel to ogle at anything that moves! Stay away from Fate or you're freakin' DEAD!!\" \"Y-Yes ma'am,\" you say nervously. \"No problem Warden Demona. Good grief!\" You grab your mouth at that Freudian slip. The next second, Destiny lets out an angry kaiju-style roar. Obviously she didn't appreciate that Demona comment. Suddenly, all you hear is a ringtone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" you say. \"She hung up.\" Actually, Destiny didn't so much as hang up, but got so enraged that she broke the phone in her hand. Back at Under Gloom, she opens a drawer to take out a spare telephone and she's so angry at this moment that not only are her eyes glowing red, but her blue skin takes on a more purplish color. \"I'M GONNA FREAKIN' KILL HIM!\" she shouts out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the guardroom you walk up to Fate and see that while one of her eyes is focused on the screens, the other eye focuses on you. \"Who was that on the phone Timmy?\" She asks. Fate covers her mouth and blushes. \"Uh,\" you say. \"No one important Fate. Dumb question, but have you had any boyfriends before.\" Fate actually bites her lip in embarrassment. \"No. Men usually stay away from me. My mother has always been a tad overprotective. My father abandoned her when he realized she was pregnant. They weren't even married.\" \"Ouch.\" You think to yourself. \"Mom brought me up since I hatched and didn't have anyone to help her. Many people don't think to much of her, but she's a lot nicer than you'd think. She's actually fond of humans.\" That surprised you. You'd think that given who she looked like Destiny would despise humans. Then again, she <i>is</i> a gargoyle. Though Destiny did threaten you over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" says Fate as she rolls her eyes. \"Mom, well, she does not like men much. The last time somebody tried to ask me out, she chased him away with a gun. And that was another gargoyle.\" You gasp but then Fate smiles and rubs her head. She's smitten with you because of the spell, but seems nervous to get close to you. Obviously Fate is probably well aware of her mom's ferocious temper towards any man that gets near her. She obviously doesn't want to risk your safety. You let out a groan as you try to think of a way out of this horrible situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass and soon the sun comes up. Fate lets out a yawn. \"Well,\" she says as she pets your head. \"It looks like quitting time.\" She wakes you up and you let out a mutter. \"Okay, good, morning Fate. See you later.\" Before you can walk away, the gargoyle giantess bends down and kisses you, much to your shock. She then blows another kiss and walks away. You let out a groan. \"This is not good.\" You say. Fate is stalking you and her mom probably wants to kill you. You have got to find Jasmine to see about some way of reversing this curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could do anything else, Lexi walks up and lets out a purr. \"I trust last night was uneventful Tim?\" \"Oh,\" you say. \"Good morning boss. It was okay. Nobody tried to break in.\" Lexi then lets out a laugh. \"Uh, I can start work at any time.\" Lexi just smiles and rubs your head with one of her paws. \"Good. But today, I think I'll let you choose your assignment.\" That didn't sound like Lexi. But you weren't complaining. Maybe you'd get to spend some time with Mazee tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" says Lexi. \"For one, you could accompany Jasmine on her first assignment. There's gonna be a parole hearing at Under Gloom and she's covering it.\" You let out a gulp. Under Gloom? That's where Fate's mom worked. \"Or,\" says Lexi. \"You can spend the entire month assisting Fate on guard duty since you did such a good job last night. By the way, you have to choose one option or you're fired.\" Lexi smirks at you and you shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, you'd be going right into the lion's den and risk getting killed by an angry gargoyle mom. On the other hand, you'd be delaying the inevitable and with each night with Fate, Destiny would just get angrier and angrier. But maybe Under Gloom wouldn't be so dangerous. Destiny doesn't even know what you look like. Maybe you can hide from her under her nose. \"So Tim?\" asks Lexi. \"What's it gonna be?\"</span></div></div>",

Well, good luck.\" Lexi walks away smirking. \"Adios Tim,\" she thinks to herself. \"Destiny will clobber him. I can imagine her stomping him right now.\" You walk up and Jasmine looks down at you with a smile. \"I can't believe it,\" she says as she picks you up. \"My first assignment. And I get to work with you.\" You mumble slightly and nod your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you gasp as Aurelia the werejackal comes forward. \"Huh, you're brave newbie,\" she says. \"Going into Under Gloom for your first case. My wife works there and she told me that the warden was in a bad mood for some reason. I'd stay away from her if I were you.\" \"Really?\" asks Jasmine. \"Oh, thank you. But what does she look like so I know to avoid her?\" Aurelia looks around before whispering to Jasmine. \"Just stay away from anyone who looks like Demona.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you and Jasmine are walking to Under Gloom with you on Jasmine's shoulder. \"Gee,\" says Jasmine. \"Under Gloom. That's the most awful prison known to Monster. I heard some bad things about Warden Destiny Sirtis. She's the toughest warden the prison's had. Nobody's managed to escape since she took over. She has thugs working for her that torture the prisoners for fun.\" You nod your head. \"Jasmine, could you do me a favor and address me as \"James\" once we step foot in Under Gloom.\" \"Why's that?\" asks the genie giantess as she gets on a bus. \"Well,\" you say. \"Destiny is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jasmine realizes something and gasps. \"Fate,\" she mutters. \"Destiny. Destiny is Fate's mom?! I made the daughter of a <i>prison warden</i> fall in love with you!? Oh no.\" You gulp. \"Destiny has alienated every man that's so much as looked at Fate. If she figures out who I am, she's gonna kill me.\" Jasmine gulps. \"Yeah. Don't worry Tim. Mum's the word.\" Poor choice of words, but you realized something. Destiny didn't know what you looked like and it's unlikely she suspected you were a human. Maybe you'd get out alive after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you and Jasmine reach the prison, a guard comes forward. This guard is a large ogress who proceeds to strip search Jasmine much to her embarrassment. \"Sorry to do this Miss,\" says the ogre woman. \"But we need to be as thorough as possible. Especially today.\" The ogress gulps as she gives back Jasmine's clothes before a blue harpy resembling a snow roc flies down to you and lets out a slight shriek. \"Hello,\" she says in a chipper mood that contrasts with her coworker's nervous tone. \"I'm Icy. You must be the reporters for the Daily Tombstone. Come right in.\" Jasmine follows Icy and inside, the prison is in chaos. Nobody's broken out, but there's panic. The guards are running around like crazy with looks of fear in their faces. One saber toothed weretigress guard even pauses to inspect a cell to make sure nobody broke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three guards in particular walking forward. The first was Clover, a green grootslang, a monster resembling a reptilian elephant with a snake for a trunk. Next was Simone, a Nue, a creature resembling a baboon with tiger arm's and a snake's tail. Last was a monster you've heard of, a bloated brown furred striped were hyena. That was Cree, Aurelia's wife. You gag as you look at Cree's obese and deranged looking form and it doesn't help that she's completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez,\" says Clover. \"Today's a bad day.\" Simone shrieks in agreement. \"I hate it when I agree with you hose nose.\" \"Hi guys,\" says Icy. \"What's going on?\" \"What's going on?\" asks Clover. \"You birdbrain, don't you see that the boss is on the warpath?\" Suddenly you hear a scream coming from down the hallway. Down the hallway, a pegasus guard is sweating as Destiny glares at her and holds up a pair of keys. \"I saw you drop these when you were patrolling the Dark Side. That's a mistake most guards only make once. If you can't hold onto your keys in the future, you'll be fired!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYikes, Destiny was so angry with the situation between you and Fate that she was taking it out on the guards. Destiny then walks the other way and grunts in pain. She looks to see she stepped on a particularly sharp human rib bone and her eyes glow red with rage. \"Cree!\" she shouts. Cree whimpers like a dog and lowers her head. \"How many times do I have to tell you not to leave your leftovers laying around on the floor! Clean up these bones or you're fired!\" Cree whimpers again and Clover lets out a laugh. Apparently she and Cree don't like each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Destiny grabs Clover by the trunk and makes her scream. \"I wouldn't laugh if I were you Clover. You punched in ten minutes late this morning and thought I wouldn't notice. If it happens again, <i>you're</i> fired!\" Destiny then stomps off in rage and Icy is confused. \"What crawled up her crack?\" the harpy asks as you hide behind Jasmine's hair. Cree let out a sigh. \"It happens every time. Whenever some dummy tries to hit on Fate, we get stuck with a bomb that won't stop going off. When the warden gets this mad, even the smallest transgression can get you a pink slip.\" Icy raises an eyebrow. \"All this because someone likes her daughter. Warden! Don't you think you're overreacting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCree, Clover and Simon gasp and Destiny turns her head with glowing red eyes before she flies at Icy and grabs the harpy by the neck as she squawks. \"Overreacting?\" asks Destiny. \"Overreacting?! <b>Overreacting</b>?! You're still new Icy, so I'll give you a fair warning. There are three ways to get on my bad side. I don't like people who try to escape, <i>never</i> call me Demona and if you have something between your legs and you value your life, STAY AWAY FROM MY DAUGHTER, or so help me... I WILL PEEL YOU LIKE AN ONION!\" Destiny drops Icy and then walks off to inspect another part of the prison. You're now very afraid. If she finds out who you are, and with Fate under that wish gone wrong, that gargoyle will rip you to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcy bites her feathers. \"Yikes,\" she says. \"And I thought <i>my</i> mom was overprotective.\" \"No joke Sherlock,\" says Clover. \"She doesn't even like other gargoyles looking at her. Thanks to that idiot flirter...\" Simone shrieks out a few things in an angry tone and Icy actually looks in surprise. \"Whoa,\" she says. \"Simone, I don't feel comfortable translating that.\" Jasmine turns to you as you walk out. \"Looks like you have every right to worry Tim.\" She whispers. You nod your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I got my hands on that Tim,\" says Clover as her trunk lets out a hiss. Suddenly Cree realizes something. \"Tim? I know who he is. He works in the same building.\" You gasp. Cree didn't seem to recognize you (not surprising since she never met you), but she was aware of you from Aurelia. \"Oh that's right,\" says Icy. \"Aurelia works at that place too.\" \"Yeah,\" says Cree. \"And Aurelia's been trying to catch that Tim and eat him for some time.\" \"Eat him?\" asks Clover. \"You mean he's human?\" Simone's jaw actually drops. \"Oh no.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human in a romantic relation with a monster?\" asks Icy. \"It's not as weird as you think,\" says Cree. \"My sister, who I'm not on speaking terms with, lives next door to a Nemean lioness who's married to one.\" \"Nemean lion?!\" you think to yourself. \"What kind of nut would marry a lion? She'd probably eat him in his sleep.\" Clover sticks out her tongue. \"It's weird he'd be interested in Fate,\" says Cree. \"Aurelia said he already had a girlfriend.\" That's when Cree realizes something and covers her mouth. \"Oh crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a bolt of lightning, Destiny flies back and tackles Cree into the wall as the other guards scatter. Destiny grits her fangs and glares at Cree. \"What was that Macbeth?\" she asks. Cree whimpers. \"Tim has a girlfriend,\" she says. \"It's not just Fate.\" \"What species?\" \"W-Wererat.\" Destiny is so mad that she scratches the wall with her claws as she drops Cree. \"That jiggalo!\" she shouts. \"He thinks he can add my baby to his harem? Now I'm going to kill him harder than I was going to before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't look good for you. Destiny was pissed beyond belief. If she found out you were Tim, you're dead. Destiny finally notices Jasmine and Jasmine is holding her tail in nervousness. \"H-Hello Warden. I'm here about the parole hearing. Lockette Locksley I believe. I'm from the Daily Tombstone.\" \"Of course you are,\" says Destiny, her tone sounding as if she's making an effort to calm down, but not by much. \"Come right this way.\" That's when you sneeze and Destiny notices you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously hold out your camera as Destiny's eyes return to normal. \"A human?\" she asks. \"Keep him close to you. Humans have a tendency to leave this building through the plumbing system. If you know what I mean.\" You gulp. \"Don't worry about me Ms. Destiny ma'am,\" you say trying to make your voice sound deeper. \"No siree.\" Destiny however raises a... well, gargoyles don't have eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound familiar,\" she says. \"I think I've heard your voice somewhere.\" \"W-Well,\" you say. \"It's probably a coincidence, like the fact you look like De... uh, it's a coincidence.\" Destiny lowers her eye to your level and you see that her eye encompasses the entire sky. Destiny may only <i>look</i> like Demona but she was so angry right now, she was as deadly as the real deal. You begin to cough slightly, hoping Destiny doesn't recognize your voice as the man who she thinks is trying to seduce her daughter. This wish was looking really bad right now.</span></div></div>",

I'll get you out of this Tim. Somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that even though Destiny is acting calm, her eyes are still bright red, albeit not glowing yet. As long as she thought you were trying to seduce Fate, she was out for blood. As Destiny is stomping down the hall, the guards begin to speak to themselves. \"What was that Tim character thinking?\" asks Clover. \"And who is he? He has some serious cajones if he's flirting with Fate.\" \"It gets worse,\" says Cree. \"I heard she was on the phone with him last night and he called her... the D-word.\" Icy lets out a squawk. \"The <i>D</i>-Word!? Does he have a death wish or something? Even I know better than to call the boss lady that hated nickname.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. \"I take it somebody doesn't have much of a sense of humor.\" Then you turn to Destiny and try to get on the right foot with her. \"So,\" you say. \"Warden. You seem stressed.\" Destiny lets out a growl. \"I am stressed,\" the blue gargoyle says. \"I just learned that some viper is trying to seduce my daughter. What's worse is that now I know she isn't the first woman he's targeted! That womanizing creep! Just wait until I get my claws on him! There's no way in hell I'm letting my Fate make the same mistake I did!\" Destiny even shows her fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so against Fate having a boyfriend?\" asks Jasmine out of curiosity. \"She seems nice.\" \"Because,\" says Destiny speaking in a whisper that is progressively getting louder. \"Men! Are! Poison! The last man I trusted left me holding the egg! I refuse to let Fate go through what I did!\" Destiny begins to pant. \"Calm down Destiny,\" she says to herself. \"Just take the reporters to interview Lockette. She's one of the good inmates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny gestures for Jasmine to follow her and Jasmine holds you tight as you shake. It doesn't look like you can explain the truth to Destiny, she's way too mad for that. She then leads you both to a cell with a purple loch ness monster giantess was sleeping away on what she hopes would be her last day at Under Gloom. \"There she is,\" says Destiny. \"Hopefully, by the end of the day she'll be out for good behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine smiles and so do you because it sounds like you got off Scott free and Destiny doesn't know you're Tim. Maybe that wish wasn't going to be so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen comes the moment where you have to really be careful. You turn to Destiny and say. \"Thanks Warden...</span></div></div>",

Destiny growls but as you try to explain yourself her glowing eyes widen. \"Wait a second...its you!\" she exclaims. Uh oh. She must have recognized you from the phone when you started stammering. \"Look I-\" you begin before she snatches you up and holds you in front of her face, giving you a clear view of her fangs. \"You have some nerve seducing my little angel and then insulting me to my face?!\" she yells. Everyone around you is backing up nervously, even Jasmine. You need to get this gargoyle to understand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, warden!

Tim hasn't-\" but she is also cut off. \"Oh, and are you another of his girlfriends?\" she says as she rounds on the neko. Jasmine just cowers and shrinks away. Destiny turns her attention back to you. \"Now how to deal with you? Should I stomp you? Or should I just make you a snack? I normally don't eat humans, but I think I can make an exception!\" she yells. She opens her mouth and brings you closer, the fangs growing ever larger. You struggle frantically as Jasmine covers her eyes in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final yelp you curse your bad luck. Then suddenly it strikes again but this time on Destiny. She fumbles a little and you slip out of her claw's grasp. You scream as you fall and then collide with her boobs. You bounce off of them and tumble down the front of her uniform. During your fall you try to grab hold of her clothes but keep losing your hold. It does however slow your decent enough for you to reach the floor relatively safely. You find yourself tumbling to the ground right in front of her clawed feet. Gazing up you see her glaring down like a raging colossus. \"You slippery little worm!\" she says. Just as she raises her foot a voice calls out. \"Mom! Stop!\" Everyone, including Destiny, looks to see Fate standing in the doorway catching her breath. Looks like she rushed over here. \"Don't hurt him!\" she pleads. \"Stay out of this sweety, I'm going to get rid of this little incubus!\" Destiny tells her daughter.

As she does a strange blue smoke exits Fate's mouth and swirls around the room. Jasmine sees it and smiles triumphantly, even though no one else knows what happened. Her face then falls when she sees the smoke head towards Destiny. It goes right in her mouth and she begins to cough before stopping her foot from squashing you. You look up to see her peering down at you with a confusing look on her face. She doesn't look mad anymore, and is staring at you like she's discovered something strange. She then reaches down and picks you up, lifting you to her mouth. \"Mom, you're not going to eat him are you?\" Fate asks, snapping her out of it. Destiny pulls you away and clears her throat. \"Of course not.\" she says. \"He hasn't done anything wrong.\" She then hands you back to Jasmine, who gives you a weak smile. If you didn't know any better though you'd think Destiny was about to kiss you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that point you continue making your way to the hearing, with Destiny sticking awfully close. Fate seems to be cured of the love she had for you, and doesn't seem to realize she ever had it. Jasmine explains that she manged to reverse the enchantment, causing you to sigh in relief. \"Uh, don't get too happy.\" she says in a whisper, so no one else will hear. You look up and tilt your head as she explains. \"When I extracted the love from Fate it uh...kind of went into her mom.\" You almost tumble off of her shoulder and she catches you. \"What?!\" you exclaim. It was weird enough when it was Fate, but Destiny? That woman was out for your blood just a few moments ago! \"Look, just calm down. At least now she's not trying to kill you.\" Jasmine says quietly. You sigh and lean back in her palm. Maybe she has a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Destiny looks over at the two of you and sees you in Jasmine's palm with her holding you close to her face. She frowns a little and interrupts. \"I have a suggestion.\" she says. \"I think it would be best for the photographer to ride with me so he gets a better vantage point.' She then plucks you out of Jasmine's hand and lifts you up. She stops for a second and looks like she's about to stuff you in her cleavage, but then doesn't and puts you on her shoulder. You see her face and get the feeling she was debating on where to put you. You don't know her that well, but from your recent experiences, you can guess this isn't her normal behavior. Like her daughter, she doesn't seem to be sure what to do about her new feelings. You see a faint blush on her face as you sit close to her neck.

Once the hearing begins you ready your camera as the Loch Ness monster girl walks in and sits in a chair in front of everyone. Jasmine and Fate are sitting off to the side, Jasmine taking notes. You check your camera and make sure its ready, but you wobble a little on Destiny's shoulder. You grab onto her neck to steady yourself, which catches her by surprise. She jolts and you are flung from your perch down toward her breasts. With a couple of bounces you land between her mountains. Frantically her claws fish you out and sets you in her palm. Looking up you see that her face is tinted ever so slightly. \"Jeez boss, you feeling okay?\" Belladona asks. \"Of course! Lets just begin!\" the gargoyle responds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk a little to the middle of her palm and ready yourself. Meanwhile Destiny's eyes wander toward you and stare for a couple of seconds before she snaps back to the task at hand. Jasmine is watching closely while Fate looks a little perplexed at her mother's behavior. There is a panel of monsters here and they begin speaking. \"So Lockette, you've been a model prisoner since day one. The warden personally feel that you've paid your debt and regret the crime you committed. How do you feel?\" one asks. The Loch Ness monster takes a breath. \"It is true that I committed a crime, no matter how small. My only goal when I got here was to serve my time and never make the same mistake again. I promise I will never get on the wrong side of the law again.\" she states nervously. The rest of the hearing goes by smoothly. Jasmine gets her article and you get a couple of good shots of Lockette. However there is the matter of the gigantic gargoyle looming over you, staring at you and then looking away. She might not be accepting of her feelings, but they are pretty strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the hearing everyone shakes hands and chats a little. \"Miss Lockette, can I get a few words?\" Jasmine asks, and the newly freed girl agrees. While the interview is happening Destiny lifts you to her face. \"So Tim, how do you like your work?\" she asks hesitantly. She's trying to act differently but you feel she really wants to talk. \"Uh its good.\" you tell her. \"It pays the rent and I get to see some interesting sights. Plus I get to work with my girlfriend so thats great.\" Her eyes flash red for a second at the mention of your girlfriend but she quickly catches herself and looks away, as if she doesn't know why she did that. \"The only problem is sometimes I end up n tight situations with my luck. Under butts, between toes, in mouths...\" you list off the various situations. Destiny listens and actually has a glint of jealousy in her eyes at the girls in the office. \"Well, you sound like a good worker. I wouldn't mind having someone like you around here.\" she says without thinking. She shuts her mouth and looks away again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter more awkward small talk Jasmine retrieves you and carries you out. Destiny waves goodbye as you go. Fate follows behind. \"Bye mom.\" she says. \"See you later sweetheart.\" her mother responds. Fate look at her confused before leaving. At least thats over. Destiny might be in love with you, but at least she won't be close to you. With her job she'll be too busy to stalk you. Thats what you though at least. The next day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day you're at work feeling good considering yesterday. First Fate was in love with you, then her mother wanted to kill you for it. Now Destiny is in love with you. The good thing is she wasn't overly expressive of it. You suppose its her personality. Fate was shy when it came to love, so it makes sense Destiny would react in her own way as well. She seemed like she didn't know what was wrong with her. Guess after hating men for so long falling in love would confuse the hell out of you. Still, its good to be back in the office with nothing to worry about. With her job Destiny will be too busy to act on her feelings, or so you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk in and head for Lexi's office. Time to find out what you're doing today. Then a rumbling comes and you find yourself between two giant furry feet. Looking up you see Mazee staring down at you. \"Hello love.\" she says as she picks you up. She gives you a big wet kiss and holds you in her palm. \"So how did it go with Under Gloom yesterday?\" she asks. \"Oh it was interesting.\" you say, which is quite true. \"Were you scared at all?\" she asks playfully. \"Oh yeah.\" you answer, again truthfully. When work is over today you plan on sitting down with her and explaining this whole love magic business. \"Well I'll get to work now, but do you want a lift to Lexi's office?\" she says. \"No I can walk.\" you tell her, and after another kiss she puts you down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to Lexi's door and are about to knock when another rumbling sound approaches. You turn around to see a pair a enormous clawed feet. At first you think its Fate, but as you look up you see this person's figure is much slimmer than hers. Upon seeing her face you fall onto your butt in surprise. \"Destiny!\" you exclaim. You're not the only one who's surprised. Many of the other workers are looking at this intimidating gargoyle confused as well. What would a person like her be doing here? She lifts you off of the ground between two claws. \"Are you okay?\" she asks. \"Uh yeah!\" you respond. \"Um, what are you doing here maam?\" She rubs your head with a claw and smiles. \"No need to be formal. Just Destiny is fine. To answer your question...I just wanted to talk to you.\" You look around for anyone who could help and spy Lexi looking through the window on the door. Looks like she finds this scene quite amusing. What does Destiny say to you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look up nervously as Destiny smiles down at you with lust and folds her wings into a cape (you had no idea that gargoyles really did that). She even showed her fangs and it didn't look like a threatening way this time. All around you your coworkers were looking in surprise and confusion. \"The warden?\" asks Anna-Maria. \"Here?\" \"What the blimey going on?\" asks Willa. \"I've saw Destiny at Under Gloom before and she was bloody uptight. What the bloody hell is happening?\" Grace even takes off her glasses slightly to polish them in disbelief as Emma squints. \"I really wish I listened to my eye doctor right now.\" The polar were bear says. Yulong scratches her chin as she extends her neck to get a good look. \"Fascinating.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleotiti is so confused she actually forgets to be afraid of you. \"Why is Destiny looking at Tim the same way Blake and Beth usually do?\" asks the mummy woman. Aurelia is looking on as Destiny's tail wags and it doesn't take a genius to put two and two together and the were jackal is horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I left the teapot on,\" Aurelia says as she leaves the room. You know that's obviously a lie but then you realize something. Destiny was her wife's boss. Aurelia wouldn't dare attack you now if she was afraid of getting Cree fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to inch away, but Destiny puts a clawed finger to her back to make you inch forward as you're now in front of her face. \"You know,\" says the gargoyle woman in a seductive tone. \"It's been decades since I've had a man in my life. The last one was a lowly worm who looked like a powerhouse, but wimped out at something he couldn't take back. But I've been thinking about the whole cross species thing since... well, last night and if it worked for one couple, it could work in reverse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spectators are now horrified, with two exceptions. For some reason, Kiki has an angry face as she looks on and lets out a chitter like an angry raccoon. Lexi on the other hand is watching from her office with a bag of tortilla chips and a wicked grin on her face. \"This is better than the Pompeii barbecue,\" the sphinx says to herself. \"Time to kick back and watch the fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Destiny nervously as her colossal blue visage is right above you. \"W-What are you saying, uh Destiny?\" you ask nervously. Destiny smiles wider than ever before giving you her answer. \"Be my Macbeth,\" she says. \"Slay the beast.\" Before you could answer, Destiny presses her lips down on you and you grunt as everyone around you looks in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Ra!\" yells Cleotiti as she grabs the sides of her head. Willa actually faints at the sight and Grace simply hands her glasses to Emma and Emma comically tries to use them to get a closer look at what's going on. \"I have got to get my prescription changed,\" says the cheetah giantess. Harley actually turns her head and vomits in response as Tara's jaw drops. Ari however smirks and snaps a photograph with her phone. \"Front paaaaage here I come.\" The weresheep says. Kiki actually gets so mad that she somehow manages to set herself on fire before stomping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny's lips just keep pushing against you and you could barely breath. That spell Jasmine cast really messed up this time. That's when you hear a loud gasp and realize this was going to get worse because you turn your head and see...</span></div></div>",

Mazee turns her attention to the gargoyle. \"Now listen hear you...\" she trails off as she looks up and sees who it is. \"Do you have business with Tim?\" Destiny asks. \"She's my girlfriend!\" you chime from her hand. The gargoyle looks down on Mazee as if she's studying her. \"Oh thats right. You have a girlfriend.\" she says dismissively. Mazee is intimidated but tries to act tough. \"Thats right, he's mine.\" she says. Destiny holds you close to herself. \"Uh Destiny?\" you say. \"I kind of have to get back to work.\" She smiles and looks at you. \"Oh! Sorry Tim. I kind of got carried away. \" she says. \"Lets continue this some other time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny frowns as she hands you to Mazee. \"You've got some explaining to do!\" Mazee tells you once she has you. You cower a little at this. Mazee is super sweet normally, but can be a terror when she's mad, Unfortunately there's another scary presence around now. You feel a glare and look up to see Destiny staring at Mazee with glowing red eyes. \"You're not threatening him are you?\" she asks. Mazee calms down and pets you gently. \"Good, because I won't have anyone hurting him. There are plenty of cells in Under Gloom.\" Mazee turns to walk away but Destiny stops her. \"Let me be clear.\" she says. \"I'm going to make him fall for me and I'm going to take him from you.\" You look nervously from one woman to the other as Mazee walks away. Destiny smiles at you seductively and wags her tail as she leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this all about?\" Mazee asks angrily. \"Well...you know Jasmine?\" you ask. \"Yeah what about her?\" You then explain everything thats happened. \"...and now instead of Fate, her mom's in love with me.\" you finish. Mazee's face softens and she gives you a wet kiss. \"I'm sorry babe. I should have known it wasn't your fault.\" she says. \"You on the other hand.\" she says to Jasmine, who was standing nearby looking guilty. \"I overheard you telling her.\" she says. \"Of all the people, you had to make HER fall for my boyfriend?\" Mazee asks. \"I'm sorry! It was a fluke! I thought it would help if I fixed Fate, but the love had to go somewhere. I didn't think it would go to Destiny!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly hear Lexi call from her office. \"Tim! Get in here!\" she says. Mazee carries you inside the office and sets you down. She gives you a kiss and leaves you with the sphinx. For some reason you feel uneasy as Lexi grins down at you. This is a pretty accurate feeling when you find out what she has planned.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think it would be a good idea for you to head back to Under Gloom.\" Lexi tells you. You are visibly shaken by this and Lexi loves it. \"Why? Is there another hearing?\" you ask. \"Oh no, I just think a day there will give us some good story material.\" she answers. You start to argue but the sphinx gives you a quick glare. \"Are you refusing to work?\" she asks. You sigh a hang your head. \"No boss.\" you say, and she smiles in triumph. \"So who's going with me?\" you ask. Lexi grins again and chuckles. \"Oh you're going it alone this time.\" she tells you. You run up to her in shock. \"Alone?! But how will I get around? Besides, I'm a photographer, not a reporter.\" you say frantically. \"When you get back you can relay your story to one of the girls, and the prison staff will help you.\" your boss says. \"In fact, your ride is already here.\" The door then opens and Destiny walks in. She looks at you with a grin and leans down to your level. \"Looks like we get to spend the day together Tim!\" she says excitedly, then looks at Lexi. \"Thanks for letting me know before I left.\" Lexi smiles at her. \"Hey, I just came up with the idea.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny scoops you up and walks out of the office with you in her hand. When she passes Mazee she waves goodbye. \"See you later, I'll take good care of him.\" she says boastfully. Mazee scowls and crushes the cups she's holding, causing the coffee inside to go everywhere. Kiki gives an angry pout from her desk and chitters as the gargoyle leaves. Outside Destiny is in the parking lot when you speak up. \"So where's your car?' you ask. \"Oh I didn't drive here, I flew.\" she tells you. \"Which reminds me, I need to find somewhere for you to ride.\" The she begins moving the hand you're around her body. \"I really enjoyed that kiss, so maybe here's a good place.\" she says as she opens her mouth. Her huge fangs are showing and her tongue moves around slowly, as if beckoning you. Then she brings you to her pants. \"Or I could drop you in here.\" she suggests as she pulls her waistband open. \"But then you might get lost in there.\" Finally she brings you to her breasts. \"I know!\" she says and drops you into her cleavage. \"Now you're secure and close to my face.\" You tumble into the boobs and your first thought is that they're very soft. You didn't expect a gargoyle to have such soft skin. You tumble around as she takes off into the sky, but its pretty comfortable. Destiny glances down at her boobs in anticipation, excited to have you to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Destiny lands she pulls you out and holds you in one hand. As you sit on her palm you gaze up at the imposing prison and gulp. Suddenly you are pressed into the palm you're sitting in by a pair of lips. Destiny is kissing you again, and this time you feel her tongue lick you a little. \"Hey!\" you call out, but she doesn't let up for a whole minute. \"We've already kissed before, so its okay.\" she tells you with a giggle. You never thought you'd hear the warden of Under Gloom giggle. She then makes her way inside with you in her palm. She also takes the time to stare at your butt from above, and you can feel her eyes on you. Eventually she comes across a group of monsters who you guess are the guards. \"Okay, everyone listen up!\" Destiny says loudly. \"This is Tim, and he's here to observe a day in the prison for the Daily Tombstone.\" The others look in your direction. \"Aww, and I thought you brought us a snack.\" a manticore woman says. Destiny is upon her in a second. \"Let me make this clear Belladona. If anything happens to him I will punish every guard and prisoner in this place. I don't care who's responsible, if he's harmed in any way everybody suffers.\" she says ferociously. Belladona backs away slowly. One of the guards, a werehyena, is standing silently. That must be Cree. No doubt Aurelia has called her and told her about her bosses infatuation. Everyone is amazed at the loving and lustful looks the warden is giving you. You feel a pinch on your butt and turn to see Destiny's huge claws behind you. \"Sorry, couldn't help myself.\" she says. Now... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well I guess I should show you around the place.\" Destiny says as she gazes lovingly at you. \"It'll be like a date!\" she adds. You chuckle nervously and sigh.The guards and Belladona are looking on in confusion. They've never seen her act like this and its kind of freaking them out. Destiny turns to them sternly. \"While I'm showing him around you all should get to work. No slacking.\" she orders. Now thats more like it. The guards file out with a final look at their lovesick boss. Belladona stays behind and is still looking at the two of you. Destiny sees her looking at you and cups her hands, hiding you. \"Need anything Belladona?\" she asks annoyed. 'Uh, no boss.\" she answers. \"Good, then. Off with you.\" Destiny spits out. The manticore leaves while shaking her head. \"What the hell is going on?\" she mutters to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of you are alone Destiny brings you to her face. \"I would take us somewhere more private, but lets get the formalities out of the way first.\" she says. \"Thanks.\" you tell her, being completely honest. You don't want her trying to get intimate with you. She walks along and gives you another kiss, then two more. The worst part is you're getting used to it. You bet Mazee is probably grinding her teeth right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay now, lets start here.\" your gargoyle guide says. You're walking along a row of normal looking jail cells. \"This is where we keep the small fries.\" she says and holds you out to get a better look. \"They're in for theft and violence and the like.\" In one cell you see a yellow skinned gremlin. \"This one was chop shopping.\" Destiny says and then moves to another cell. Inside this one is a monster with silvery skin and eyeballs all over her body. \"This is Cornelia. She was an illegal gambler.\" Destiny then lowers her face and whispers. \"She's also my best informant. Anything she sees comes right to me, and as you might guess she sees a lot.\" While she's near you she gives you another kiss and giggles. Some of the prisoners look up as they've never heard the warden giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on you see some more cells but they're a little different. \"These prisoners aren't exactly that much worse, but still get special attention.\" One cell has a green ghost looking girl with plants growing out of her back. \"That one needs a special cell to keep her in.\" Indeed, the walls are solid and clear so as to keep her from slipping out. Further along is a cell with an Egyptian looking Cheshire Cat girl wearing some sort of collar. \"This is Bebe. She's a thief, but she's big time. She's pulled a lot of heists and we have to keep her invisibility powers locked with that collar.\" There's also an orc with palish white skin in another cell. \"This one is good with potions and got caught practicing medicine without a license. We keep her away from any materials she might be able to use.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your initial protests this is actually kind of interesting. You're not really scared of these criminals because you know Destiny will protect you. You are a little scared of Destiny though. She then comes up on a corridor that is much darker than the rest of the place. \"Whats that?\" you ask. \"This is the Dark Side.\" Destiny says. \"Its where we keep the worst of the worst.\" She holds you away from it and steps away. \"I don't think I want you in there Tim. Something could happen to you.\" She strokes you gently and you wonder what the prisoners there are like.</span></div></div>",

I'll show you the inmates files later, but I don't want you near them.\" she tells you. \"We can look over them while we're alone.\" she adds with a wink. \"Hehe...\" you say. \"As great as that sounds I'd really like to get a first hand look at the place. It will really help my perspective you know?\" Destiny still looks reluctant so you resort to a different tactic. \"Come on, won't you do it for me?\" you ask. She's holding you close to her chest so you put a hand on her boob and give her a pleading look. That look plus the physical contact wins her over. \"Okay, I can't say no to that!\" she says with a smile and gives you a series of kisses. You just bear it for a second and wait for her to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Destiny walks toward the Dark Side she places you in her cleavage. \"I want you to stay as close as possible.\" she says. You wonder what these prisoners are like as you settle between the giant pillows. You notice that the further you get the darker it becomes. Guess \"Dark Side\" isn't just a name. The first cell you see contains a giant grizzly werebear thats missing her left eye. \"This is Ursula.\" Destiny tells you. \"She's in here for leading a riot against the governor. She hates fairies and the like.\" You remember this because it was covered in the Daily Tombstone. It was an anti fairy riot and the governor is also a fairy. \"What are you dong here?\" Ursula says to Destiny. \"Just checking up you.\" Destiny responds sternly before walking away. As she does you can see Ursula's good eye looking at you. Next Destiny comes upon a cell containing a dragon woman with orange brown scales and long blonde hair. She's also got ram like horns. \"Arethusa here was manufacturing bombs used for murder.\" Destiny says. As you near the cell you can see the dragon open her mouth and a small flame starts to form. \"I'd put that fire out right now.\" Destiny says harshly. \"Otherwise you'll end up in the pit.\" The flame dies down and Arethusa looks away. \"That one doesn't like to be disturbed so she tries to burn anyone who gets near her.\" Destiny says. \"She won't dare try it on me but I'm still scared for your safety. I should really muzzle her.\" Even though you're a little too close for comfort you are grateful that Destiny is with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple cells down you see a huge centaur woman with the lower body of a quagga. As soon as you get a good look Destiny turns away. \"Thats Mariah. She's in here for rape.\" Destiny says. \"She doesn't even care what species it is, and she loves human males.\" She puts a hand to her chest and presses you in as she walks away. \"Hey warden! When are gonna get some male guards in here?\" Mariah calls out and then laughs. Destiny turns and growls at her before moving on. The next cell has a giant werewolf with white fur and red eyes. She's also wearing a muzzle. You know who this one is before Destiny even explains. \"Persephone here is a cannibal who preys on other monsters. She's claimed victims from Horrorville, Fearfield, and all over the monster world. She's so vicious we had to muzzle her or she'd try to eat the guards and even the other prisoners. Thats also why she's in this cell 24/7.\" Destiny says. Persephone was such a famous criminal that you already knew some of that. What really gets you is that she looks like one of the new interns at the Daily Tombstone, a werewolf named Hecate. While you were getting to know her you learned that Persephone was her twin, but it really strikes you just how much they look alike. The only difference is that Hecate has black fur and blue eyes. Persephone looks out and sees Destiny. \"Come on warden, can't you at least send one of those plump guards of yours? I can't eat gargoyle meat.\" she says with a chuckle. Moving on Destiny looks down at you. \"I can tell that she's one of the more clever ones. I feel like she could actually escape if we gave her even the smallest opening.\" she tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the last cells you come across contains another monster you recognize. She's an obese gorgon with blue pythons for hair named Yuri. Like Persephone her crimes are famous and she's been covered in the paper. You see that she's wearing some sort of visor. \"This is Yuri, one of our worst prisoners. She used her gorgon eyes to turns over a hundred monsters to stone just to mutilate them for her own sick amusement.\" Destiny tells you. \"We put that visor on her to cancel out her petrifying gaze.\" The snakes on Yuri's head hiss and and snap in your direction. \"I can hear you warden. Too bad I can't get a good look.\" Yuri says menacingly. Destiny walks away and exits the Dark Side. \"Wouldn't have worked anyway.\" she says and you look at her. \"Over the years gargoyles evolved so we don't turn to stone during the day. An added bonus is that we can't be turned to stone by any other means either.\" she explains. Huh. You never knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That concludes our tour.\" Destiny says. \"Now we can-\" she starts before you hear a ruckus. Destiny turns and sees a random goblin prisoner running in her direction. When the goblin turns and looks in front of her she sees the warden and her face goes pale. Behind her one of the guards, a roc harpy with blue feathers is chasing her. \"Stop!\" she says and starts flapping her wings. An icy wind forms and the ground underneath the prisoner freezes, causing her to slip. She slides toward Destiny who places a clawed foot on her chest. \"Again, Icy?' she says irritated. \"Sorry warden!\" the harpy shouts as she reaches them. Unfortunately her powers are still going and more of the floor continues to freeze. Icy slips as well and collides with Destiny. This wouldn't phase the huge gargoyle normally but with the ground frozen she slips as well and falls forward. The impact causes her breast to squeeze you out and you go sliding across the vast floor. Where are you headed?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look in the direction of the noise and are horrified to see Mariah standing over you. She scans the floor and you stay perfectly still. Unfortunately she spots you and reaches down to grab you. \"I knew I smelled a man.\" she says with a grin. \"You were with Destiny weren't you?\" You shake with fear as you remember what this woman is in jail for. Her eyes look at you hungrily and her tail begins to swish back and forth. Bringing you to her face she extends her tongue and gives you a long lick. \"What are you doing?\" you ask frightened. \"Oh I'm just getting you ready.\" Mariah answers with a grin. Oh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle between her fingers and suddenly you slip out. You fall down to her cleavage and slip inside. \"Damn it!\" Mariah says, cursing her bad luck. You squirm in her boobs until her giant hand come in and fishes you out. Once again you are brought to her huge face. \"Well that was unexpected but I gotta say it felt kinda good.\" she says. \"Now where was I?\" You struggle once again, hoping you can give her some more bad luck. You actually succeed and end up falling toward her shoulder. Grabbing on to her prison shirt you climb up and slide down her back. When the slide ends you land onto her horse back and take off for the other end. Suddenly a hand appears from above and slams down just inches from you, barely missing. \"Where are you going little bug?\" Mariah asks as you run along the length of her body. When you get to her butt she smiles. \"Ooh, thats a sensitive area! I can feel your little feet!\" she says happily. You think you're in the clear but suddenly her tail comes down and slaps you like a fly, knocking you off of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually manage to grab her tail but it swing so much you are tossed to the ground. Not wasting any time you sprint for the cell doors. Mariah felt you leave her ass and looks to the floor. She sees you running away and catches up with you in seconds. A massive hoof crashes down in front of you, knocking you down. Mariah picks you up again and cuts the smalltalk short this time. \"Enough waiting! I'd say I earned this!\" she says.</span></div></div>",

You draw closer and closer to her horse behind until you hear stomping. Both you and Mariah turn to see a set of glowing red eyes in the darkness. \"Mariah!!\" their owner shouts, revealing herself to be Destiny. When she reaches the cell she slams into the bars and grips them in her claws. \"Give him to me now!!\" she roars at the centaur. Mariah, intimidated by the warden's ferocity, just stares for a couple of seconds. Sure, the inmates have seen Destiny angry, but this is a new level. She seems ready to tear her apart! \"I'm warning you!\" the gargoyle says as she grabs the keys to the cells. Before she can open the door Mariah thrusts you forward. \"Here! Take him!\" she says, her voice shaking a little. Destiny grabs you and nuzzles you against her cheek as Mariah watches in confusion. She then turns to walk away, but addresses the centaur as she does so. \"You can expect some time in the pit for this!\" she spits out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny stomps out of the Dark Side while stoking you gently. She also presses you into her palm with a kiss. When you are released from the kiss you see that the harpy girl from before is standing there looking nervous. \"Icy!\" Destiny says angrily. Icy flinches at her voice. \"Because of you, Tim could have been hurt or worse!\" She emphasizes \"or worse.\" Icy looks terrified as her boss rants. \"You can expect to be punished for this!\" Destiny says. You feel sort of bad for the girl and try to calm Destiny down. \"Come on Destiny she didn't mean it.\" you say. \"But she almost got you...\" she responds. \"Just let her off. For me?' you ask, then put a hand on her claw. She smiles warmly and turns to the young harpy. \"I'll let it go this time.\" she says, causing Icy to sigh in relief. \"Now thank Tim. If it wasn't for him you'd be in real trouble!\" Icy turns to you and leans in close. \"Thank you so much Tim!\" she says gratefully, then turns and walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Tim? She didn't do anything before I got there did she?\" Destiny asks. \"No I'm fine. Thankfully I managed to last until you showed up.\" you tell her. She pets you and nuzzles you again. \"I'm so sorry though! I should have been watching you better!\" she says. You endure her smothering and she eventually stops. \"You know...this whole thing has me thinking.\" she says. \"I would be devastated if someone were to take you before I did.\" she says. \"Uh, Mazee already has.\" you state. Destiny brushes this off. \"Lets  forget about that rat and focus on us.\" she says in a huff. \"Seeing you in the clutches of that centaur made me realize I want this bad.\" You notice that she's carried you into her office and locked the door. \"Wait a minute!\" you say desperately, but she puts a giant claw to your lips. \"Shhhhh. You'll thank me later.\" she says. What next?</span></div></div>",

When you see this you start to panic. \"Destiny! I don't think-\" you say, but once again she interrupts. \"Don't worry Tim. It will be great, trust me.\" she tells you as she puts another claw to your lips. She brings you over to her pants and drops you in. As you fall toward her you get one last look at her smiling face before she releases her pants with a snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tumble down into her panties and bump into something soft. When you pick yourself up you see that you're right in front of Destiny's massive privates. With a groan you put a hand to your face. \"How did this happen?\" you ask yourself. Since you're so close you can smell her womanly aroma and try not to let it get to your head. You're no stranger to monster pussy, as you and Mazee have been sexually active for a while. There's just a lot less fur here. Deciding to just wait this out you remain perfectly still, hoping Destiny will take you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately this just makes her impatient and she decides to take control. \"Are you feeling shy? Let me help.\" she says from above. Suddenly something from outside her underwear, probably her claw, begins pushing you toward her pussy. You struggle to stay away but you're no match for the finger of the titanic gargoyle. She pushes you until you collide face first with her womanhood and she shudders in pleasure. \"Oh Tim! This feels so good!\" she says. You try to push away but you accidentally get your arm stuck inside. This causes her to jolt and moan. \"I knew you would come around.\" Destiny says happily. \"No! That was an accident!\" you shout, knowing she either can't hear you or would ignore you. Her finger pushes you again and you find yourself heading inside of her. The more you struggle the wetter she becomes until eventually she climaxes. In a rush of fluids you exit her and lay inside her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is horrible. When Mazee finds out she'll murder you or worse, she'll go after Destiny and get herself locked up! Suddenly the light shines in as Destiny reaches in to pull you out. \"That was wonderful! Its been years since I've had a man!\" she says. With her man hating attitude you believe her. The rest of the day actually goes by smoothly, despite Destiny's kisses and snuggling. Thanks to your little quickie she's in a great mood. You on the other hand are feeling nervous and guilty.

Its Mazee, and she looks pretty miffed. \"Finally! No one bothered to tell me you were taking my boyfriend until after you left!\" she says in a huff. Destiny smirks down at the wererat. \"What the matter? Are you afraid I'll win him over while you're not around?\" Mazee just glares and holds out her paw. \"Whatever, just give him back!\" she demands. Truth be told, you're torn over how you feel about seeing Mazee. You're definitely glad to be with her, but this means you have to tell her about what happened with Destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny takes you out of her boobs and hands you over. \"By the way...\" she says as she does so. \"I got one step closer to claiming him, so watch out.\" Mazee's eyes narrow and she glares down on you. It feels like a gorgon's gaze. \"What does mean?\" she asks. \"He only got some face time with my most private area.\" Destiny says smugly. Mazee's eyes go from narrow to wide and she bares her teeth. \"What!?\" she exclaims and clenches you in her fist. You struggle in her tight grip and Destiny becomes worried. \"Hey! Loosen up!\" she says and grabs Mazee's arm. \"Don't touch me!\" the wererat yells, but loosens her grip. \"Tim, how could you?!\" she asks angrily. \"Mazee, it wasn't me! She forced me to!\" you try to explain. Mazee looks at Destiny with rage. \"You RAPED him!?\" she says. \"No! I love him!\" Destiny counters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two gigantic women argue everyone watches. Lexi is trying not to laugh as she watches with a smile. \"Just leave us alone!\" Mazee shouts and stomps away with you. \"Mazee, I-\" you begin but she stops you. \"I know Tim, I don't blame you.\" she says. You're thankful until she speaks again. \"But that doesn't mean I'm not mad. You still have a punishment coming.\" she adds. At least she's still acting like herself.

Destiny just looks calmly at the shorter monster and smiles. \"Look, I know I've been a little pushy...\" she says. \"Pushy?! You forced him into your underwear!\" Mazee snaps. Destiny holds a hand up. \"Yes, and I'm sorry, but you have to know I truly love him.\" she says. Mazee rolls her eyes, not wanting to say that the only reason Destiny loves you is magic. \"I know you're mad, so how about I buy you two a drink sometime?\" Mazee narrows her eyes. \"Why should I trust you?\" she asks. \"I just want to make amends.\" Destiny says. \"I think it would be better for Tim if we could be on good terms, even if I can't have him.\" Mazee looks at you and sighs. \"Fine.\" she says. \"But you better not try anything.\" Destiny smiles. \"I wouldn't dream of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night you and Mazee head to the bar Destiny picked. When you arrive Destiny descends from the sky and lands beside you. \"Thanks for coming, I really appreciate it.\" she says. Mazee simply nods. \"Thanks for inviting us.\" you say. Destiny smiles at you and Mazee glares at you. \"Sorry.\" you say meekly. You gotta be extra careful so it doesn't seem like you're flirting. When you all head inside you head to the bar and Destiny orders the drinks. \"So how did you two meet?\" Destiny asks. Mazee looks at her for a second and sighs before answering. \"Well he was on a slice of my pizza, and I almost ate him. Thankfully I found him in time and the rest is history.\" You stare up at your wererat girlfriend from you spot on the bar happily. You'll never forget that day. You never thought a near death experience would be a blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night goes on and you all get some drinks in you the girls become a little tipsy. Destiny is talking about her old flame. \"That blockhead thought he was so tough, but when it came time to take responsibility he just up and left! Thats why I won't let any man near my little Fate. They're bad news!\" she states drunkenly. Then she looks at you hazily. \"Except you Timmy. You're a good one.\" She smiles and leans closer to you. \"Wait a second, I thought we agreed he's mine.\" Mazee says in a slurred voice and snatches you up. She covers you in a sloppy kiss and you are drenched in her saliva. Unlike them you aren't that drunk. Sure you have a buzz going, but they're another story. Before you know it Destiny is massaging Mazee's shoulders and Mazee is smiling contently. The gargoyle leans down on her and the next thing you know... </span></div></div>",

The two monsters lock lips with and begin making out again. Destiny's tongue invades Mazee's mouth and toys with you just as Mazee's did. You are then pulled into the gargoyle's mouth and tossed around. Mazee must be really drunk to do this. Pretty soon both of hem are fighting over you with their tongues until you end up back in Mazee's mouth. \"I told you, he's mine.\" she says with a smile before spitting you into her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say we take this little party elsewhere?\" Destiny asks. She has one arm around Mazee's shoulders and is rubbing your head with the other hand. You can see your girlfriend pondering this and just stare dumbfounded.

You get a face full of fur and are stuck there until the two women decide to take you out. Destiny and Mazee walk while holding each other down the street. It doesn't take long to to arrive. Destiny apparently lives close to the bar. As the gargoyle takes her keys and fumbles with them Mazee pulls you out of her boobs. You look up and are a little intrigued by what you see. Destiny's house has some strange looking statues on the side, and there's a demonic face right on the front door. After a minute of trying she finally gets the keys into the door and welcomes you inside. \"Come into my nest...\" she says jokingly. Mazee laughs and enters, Destiny giving her a slap on the ass as she does. Her butt jiggles and the gargoyle closes the door with a slam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou marvel at the decor of the place. Its done in a gothic style, with a lot of black and dark blue. The furniture is done in spider web designs and you also see a collection of glass figures. They appear to be mythical heroes and monsters. \"Nice place.\" Mazee says as she looks around as well. \"Thanks, but it is a little lonely.\" Destiny says and puts an arm around her shoulder. She's holding Mazee but her eyes are always on you. Seems like she really wants both of you. Mazee looks up at her dazed and smiles before they engage in another kiss. Destiny grabs you and tosses you in her mouth so you can all participate. As they make out they move to the bedroom and fall onto Destiny's bed. Destiny is on top and she sits up on your wererat girlfriend. \"Its been so long since I've shared this bed with someone else.\" she says, spitting you onto Mazee in the process. You land on Mazee's boob and Destiny stands up. She starts to strip and you just have to stare. You're only human after all. Mazee then tosses you onto the mattress and stands up to undress as well. When both of them are nude them hug each other and rub against each other's bodies. Destiny is bigger and has a great hourglass figure, while Mazee has the BBW body you love so much. Both of them are beautiful and are looking right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we come Tim.\" Destiny says and pushes Mazee to the bed. The wererat lands with a thud and you bounce into the air. Mazee snatches you from midair and places you on her boob. You grab her nipple to stay on and she gasps a little. \"Let me in on that.\" Destiny says. She lowers herself onto Mazee and their breasts push against each other. You are caught between two nipples and find yourself gripping both of them. With Destiny's firm but still soft boob above and Mazee's soft and furry boob below you find yourself getting a hard on. When the two of them stop kissing Destiny lifts her self up and lays next to Mazee. She picks you up and places you back on Mazee's boob. \"Go on Timmy, let me see you pleasure her.\" she says lustfully. You oblige and grip Mazee's nipple and bite away. Mazee twitches and turns as you do so, and Destiny joins on as well. She begins to tease Mazee's other boob, twisting the nipple with her claw. Then you feel a presence from above and see a shadow looming. Destiny's face is coming down and her mouth opens to take in you and the nipple. She begins suck and swirl you around as Mazee moans. When she's done they trade places and repeat the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of them are finally ready they move on to the main event. \"Its time for you to do your duty Tim.\" Mazee says as they sit with you between them. They have their legs open, revealing their monster pussies. Destiny cups Mazee's boobs and gives her a begging look. \"Can I go first?\" she asks. Mazee thinks for a second and smiles. \"Sure.\" she answers. She then grabs you between two fingers and shoves you into Destiny's womanhood. You slip out of her grasp as her finger move around and tease the gargoyle from the inside. You take the cue and start moving about as well, even licking and biting in places. On the outside Destiny is thrashing about while you and Mazee work her and eventually reaches her climax. Mazee pulls her fingers out and you slide out as well in a flood of juices. You can't rest however as its Mazee's turn next. After more pleasure the three of you finally start to doze off. The girls fall asleep clutching each other with their breasts up against one another. You lay on the side of Mazee's furry boob and sleep as well. How does Mazee react the next morning?</span></div></div>",

Then the blurry memories of last night start to form. Her eyes go wide and she looks over at the sleeping gargoyle next to her. \"What the hell did we do?\" she says. You are roused from your sleep and yawn. When you see the look on her face you rub her fur. \"Calm down Mazee.\" you say. She picks you up and brings you to her face. \"Tim, I'm so sorry!\" she says. \"I was drunk!\" You give her a kiss on the lips and try to calm her down. \"Its okay, I think we at least had a good time.\" you say. Mazee sighs and rubs her head. \"Thats another thing I feel bad about. I think I'm starting to like her.\" she admits, then pats your head. \"Don't get me wrong! I love you more than anything, but she's...\" she trails off and you finish her sentence. \"Hot?\" you say. \"Yeah, I agree. Also you have to admit that she is a nice woman.\" You and Mazee sit in silence for a minute trying to make sense of your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys talking about?\" A voice says. You and Mazee look over and see Destiny laying on her side with a smirk. Both of you look down guiltily but she reaches over and scratches your head. \"I had a great time too.\" she says. \"So how about we do this more often?\" You and Mazee both blush and Destiny puts her hand on Mazee's shoulder. \"Look, I love Tim and you love Tim. If we can get along like this all the time then we can share him right?\" Mazee and you glance at each other and then look at destiny. \"Fine.\" Mazee says with a sigh.Destiny lets out a cheer and grabs Mazee for a hug. \"Thank you so much! I knew I could convince you of my love for him!\" she exclaims. \"Just remember, I'm the main girlfriend.\" Mazee says. \"Yes of course, as long as I can have Tim!\" the gargoyle responds and snatches you up. She gives you a big smooch and the three of you lie thee for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen its finally time to get up you all head to the kitchen. Destiny grabs a box of cereal and pours two bowls. \"Sorry I don't have much of a selection.\" she says. \"I don't really cook much.\" She looks a little embarrassed by this. \"Its okay.\" you tell her. As the two monsters eat their cereal you nibble from Mazee's spoon until you're full. Suddenly there's a knock on the door and Destiny gets up to answer it. When she comes back you see Fate behind her. You and Mazee freeze up and just stare at her. Well its not like you could avoid it forever. You have to explain things to her but how will she take it?</span></div></div>",

The purple gargoyle regards you with a nod and her gaze moves to Maze, who looks down. \"You guys mind telling me what you're doing here?\" she asks. Her mother answers for you. \"Well we had some drinks last night and ended up taking the party back to my place!\" she says. Fate shakes her head and looks to you. \"Tim, I don't know what happened but she's been telling me how much she loves you! Whats going on?\" she says. \"Well they say love is unpredictable.\" you say. Fate rolls her eyes but Destiny steps in. \"Its true! I fell in love the first time I met him!\" she says. Fate then addresses Mazee. \"How did you get roped into this?\" she demands. \"Well I wasn't too happy about your mom hitting on Tim, so she invited us out to patch things up. One thing led to another and...\" she trails off. \"See honey? Everything is fine!\" Destiny assures her. Fate just rubs her temples. \"Tim, you know she's old enough to be your mother twice over right?\" she asks. Destiny frowns and tries to quiet her. \"Don't talk about my age Fate!\" she says defensively. Hearing that does surprise you and you blurt out the first thing that comes to mind. \"You look fantastic though!\" you say to calm her down. The older gargoyle rushes over and picks you up for a kiss. The three of you look at Fate for her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is a bit weird, but I have to say I don't think I've ever seen her this happy.' she admits. \"Its gonna take a lot of getting used to, but if you can keep her happy I guess its okay.\" You and Mazee sigh in relief while Destiny gives her daughter a kiss on the cheek. \"Thats my girl, and don't worry, you'll always come first.\" she says happily. \"So you'll get back to handling the prison now?\" Fate asks. \"Yes, and I'll be running at full capacity again now that I have my Timmy.\" she answers. \"Just because I have a boyfriend doesn't mean I can go soft.\" Fate smiles and gives her mom a hug. \"I'm glad you're happy.\" she says and turns to you. \"And you better keep her that way.\" she tells you. You nod. \"You bet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the morning drags on all of you notice its time to get to work. \"Hey Tim, why don't you head to Under Gloom with me?\" Destiny asks. \"Or would you rather go to work with Mazee?\" Then she gets another idea. \"Oh! Or you could spend the day with Fate and get to know each other better!\" she suggests. \"That could work.\" Fate says. \"You could just come to work with me tonight and Mazee can tell Lexi you're working the night shift.\" What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Well you're one of the toughest around.\" She smiles at the praise and pets your head. After a little while she lands and you look up to see the prison. Its just as imposing as ever.

I know she's after my job, but she's good at what she does.\"  You notice that her demeanor is different from the last time you were here. Instead of being all over you she's reverted to how she was before she fell in love. You guess now that she's won you over she can focus on her job again. When she reaches her office she sits down and pulls you from her boobs. She sets you on the desk and lowers her face so that is right in front of you. With a grin she gives you a kiss and her lips press you into the desk. She then licks you several times before putting you back in her boobs. \"Okay, now lets get started.\" she says.

Cree stands up straight but before she answers she sees you. \"Is uh, the newspaper here again sir?\" she asks. Destiny pats your head before answering. \"Yes, and just to get things out in the open Tim here is my boyfriend now.\" she says. She talks in a serious tone but she smiles for a second as she pats you. Cree is taken aback by this statement, but also by the smile. She doesn't think she's ever seen the warden genuinely happy. \"Now what were you doing?\" Destiny asks. Cree shakes off her surprise and answers. \"Its Wade. He got out again.\" she says. Destiny scowls. \"That little rat! Keep searching for him. I'll be on the lookout too.\" she says, and goes on her way. Cree shrugs and goes back to hunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Wade?\" you ask. \"I thought this was a female prison.\" Destiny looks down and sighs. \"He's a special prisoner.\" she tells you. \"Even though he's a human they put him in here.\" You keep prodding. \"What did he do to get himself locked up in the monster world?\" you ask. \"He lit a mummy on fire. The poor dear was so traumatized she developed a fear of humans.\" she says. \"There's a mummy at the Daily Tombstone who's scared of humans! I  heard she was set fire to! Her names Cleotiti.\" you say. Destiny nods. \"Yep, thats her. I heard from Fate that she works there.\" she says. \"Anyway, from what I know Wade was essentially shipped to Terrordale because his hometown didn't want to deal with him. Thats why he got sent to prison here.\" Wow, this guy sounds like a real piece of work. \"Is he really that bad?\" you ask. Destiny scowls. \"That little jerk is the bane of my existence! He's rude disruptive, and has tried to escape too many times! If he would just serve his sentence he could leave, but he has to be difficult! I would never eat a human but sometimes I think about making an exception for him!\" she rants. Wow, she's almost as mad as she was when she was trying to kill you for Fate falling in love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny reaches a cell and you see a baby blue jersey devil monster inside. \"Eva! Do you know where Wade went?\" Destiny asks. \"N-no maam.\" the girl answers nervously. \"He must have gotten out while I was napping.\" She sounds like a nice girl. Destiny walks away and sighs. \"Thats Wade's new cellmate.\" she explains. \"We put her in after Lockette was released. She was arrested for insider trading but she's a model prisoner. She just wants to serve her time, much like Lockette did. Since she doesn't eat humans its the best place to put him, although I might just seal him in a jar.\" She goes back to her rounds , keeping an eye out for Wade.

He's always trying to escape and I'll be damned if I let a HUMAN of all things get out on my watch. Not to mention he has absolutely no respect for anyone!\" She says.

Destiny turns and is there in a flash. \"Give him here!\" she demands authoritatively. The hellhound obediently does so, not wanting to draw the warden's wrath. Destiny holds the human up to her face and scowls. \"At it again Wade?' she asks. \"I would've been clear if that mutt would have just stayed still!\" he responds. From what you can tell he seems like a pretty angry guy.

He happens to glance down and sees you in between her boobs. \"What is he, another prisoner?\" he asks. \"Actually I'm her boyfriend.\" you call up. \"Tim, don't talk to him. He'll only cause trouble.\" Destiny says. Wade gives you a disgusted look. \"Seriously?! How can you stand it? She's a gargoyle for God's sake!\" he says.

Destiny leans in close and bares her fangs. \"You have a debt to repay and I'm going to see that you pay it! All you have to do is serve your time!\" she argues. Wade turns his back on her and scoffs. \"Whatever, I'm not doing what a bunch of giant freaks tell me Demona!\" he says. Uh oh, he called her Demona.

He just repeats you in a mocking tone and glares at you. \"Whatever, I've been dealing with old blue butt for a while. I'm not scared of her.\" he says. \"Whats with you though? Do you realize that your girlfriend is a huge monster?\" You roll your eyes. \"Yes, and thats totally fine. She's sweet and pretty hot.\" you tell him. He looks at you dumbfounded. \"Seriously!? She's practically the devil!\" he exclaims. \"Not only that, but I have another girlfriend who's a wererat. I love them both.\" you add. Wade's eyes widen. \"Forget her, you're the freak!\" he says. \"How could any self respecting human be in a relationship with not one, but two monsters?! A leather winged tyrant and some disgusting rat!?\" You feel like punching him right now but just then an enormous claw appears and pins him to the bottom of the jar. \"I swear Wade, you better stop insulting my boyfriend!\" she says, her eyes once again glowing. You don't try to stop her this time. Wade continues to defy her despite the pressure. \"I'd say he's insulting himself with girls like you!\" he says as he struggles. Destiny increases the pressure and he finally starts to feel the pain. Seeing his distress, your girlfriend lifts her claw and smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Wade catches his breath Destiny finishes her paperwork. \"Thats one more escape attempt on your record. She tells him. Your time just keep getting longer and longer.\" Wade glares at her and she screws a lid on his jar. She picks it up and gives it a little shake. She smirks at her little joke and looks to you. You return her smile and she puts you back between her boobs. She carries Wade's jar through the prison and arrives back at his cell. \"Eva!\" she calls. The Jersey Devil approaches slowly and Destiny thrusts the jar inside. \"Keep him in this jar so he doesn't cause trouble. Am I clear?\" Destiny says. Eva nods vigorously and sighs when the warden walks away. After dealing with Wade she heads back to work and runs into Belladona. \"I found Wade and returned him.\" she tells the manticore. \"Thats great sir.\" Belladona says and glances down at you. \"Hi!\" you call up.

The guards are all still amazed when they see their warden acting so lovingly. Just how stressed did that Wade character make her? Whatever the case, you just want to help her be happy. Its funny. This all started because of a love spell, but now you actually care about her. Not as much as Mazee, though, but you still care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on Destiny gets off of work and flies toward her home with you in her boobs. When she gets there she enters and heads for the living room. You still find it amazing how big her house is, and that she's been living here alone this long. She sets you down on the coffee table and leans in close. \"I can't believe I actually got through this day with my sanity intact. Normally dealing with Wade would have me pissed off all the way home.\" she says, then gives you a big kiss. \"Its all thanks to you Tim.\" You blush and smile at her, then she grins. \"That being said. it was a bit tiring. Would you do me a favor?\" she asks. \"Anything!\" you say. She leans back and places her feet up next to you. \"Would you mind rubbing my talons?\" she asks. \"Sure.\" you say and walk up to her. Her massive feet stand before you and you get to work. You rub her foot as best as you can but all you can really reach is the ball of the foot. Still, she sighs as if you're doing a great job. There's a definitely a smell of sweat but its not too bad. You've been rubbing Mazee's feet during your relationship so you're kind of used to it. You move on to the other foot and after that she repositions herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny picks you up and lies on her side on the sofa. She then drops you onto her foot so you can better reach the rest of it. She gives you an encouraging look and you get to work rubbing the side of her foot. She sighs happily and relaxes as you do. You climb all over her foot and make sure to get in between her toes. Suddenly her toes clench together and you are trapped. You look toward her face and see that she's fallen asleep.

The gargoyle glances down at the counter and when her eyes lock with yours she smiles widely. \"And there's my favorite little human.\" she says and snatches you up. \"Thanks for the massage.\" she says after giving you a big kiss. \"Yeah well, I got kind of stuck.\" you reply. She just grins and kisses you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three of you sit down to eat Destiny looks at the food before her. Mazee made roast dinosaur with various vegetables. \"It looks great Mazee!\" the gargoyle says. \"Its nothing really, just something I threw together real quick.\" Mazee says. The two giantesses then begin to dig in. Mazee cuts a small piece of meat and gives it to you. You're sitting on her plate as she eats, sharing her food. \"Still, this is great.\" Destiny says. \"The only time I eat home cooked food is when Fate comes over and cooks for me.\" You and Mazee smile at each other and continue eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Destiny takes a shower while you and Mazee watch some TV. When she finishes the two of you jump in as well. After you finish Mazee carries you into the bedroom, both of you in your underwear. As soon as you enter you see Destiny on the bed naked. Mazee walks over and Destiny pulls her down into a kiss. You tumble onto the bed and look up at the two kissing giants. Soon a claw grabs you and adds you to the mix as well. After a round of loving the three of you are sleeping embraced. No one notices, however, that as Destiny sleeps contentedly a cloud of blue mist escapes her mouth. </span></div></div>",

The wererat sits up and stretches with you still clinging to her boob. She plucks you off and gives you a kiss as Destiny wakes up as well. The three of you get ready for work and then have some breakfast. \"I''ll take him today.\" Mazee says as she finishes. \"He can't miss work too much.\" Destiny nods and pats your head. \"Okay, I'll see you two later.\" she says as she opens the door. Then she spreads her wings and takes flight. No one notices that during breakfast a little blue mist traveled from Destiny's mouth to Mazee's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you and Mazee arrive at work you run into Fate as she ends her shift. \"Hi Fate.\" you call up from Mazee's shoulder. The gargoyle smiles and stops to chat a little. \"Hey guys, how are you?\" she asks. \"Great! We made your mom dinner last night.\" Mazee tells her. Fate grins and places a hand on her shoulder. \"Thanks guys, really. I have to say she's never been this relaxed before.\"  she says happily. You all say goodbye and move on, but not before some blue mist escapes Mazee's mouth and enters Fate's. The gargoyle stops and looks back at you as Mazee walks away. She gives you a smile before continuing on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets get this over with.\" you say as Mazee heads for Lexi's office. As she moves through the building more blue mist gets spread around. She opens the door and walks in, making Lexi look up from her paperwork. \"Oh, you can just leave him.\" the sphinx says. Mazee shrugs and sets you on the floor, bidding you farewell. Before she leaves the mist enters Lexi's mouth. \"Listen, I don't know how you did it but the warden is head over heels for you and Mazee didn't squash you for it.\" she says annoyed. You just shrug and she sighs. \"Whatever, you're working with Ari today.\" she says and waves you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave her office and head for Ari's desk. You hate working with this weresheep.She embellishes a lot in her articles and sometimes outright lies. The worst part is that she sees humans as nothing but slaves. You climb up onto her desk when a shadow appears over you. You look up to see a heavy set weresheep with red wool all over her body. She's got a mess of wool on top of her head and two curved horns. What strikes you odd is that she's smiling, but nicely. \"Hi Tim,\" she says as she pats your head. You're more than a little confused. Ari has never been nice to you before. The weresheep moves closer so her skirt is right next to you and quickly flashes her underwear to you. Your eyes go wide as she giggles. \" Don't worry, I'll be nice today.\" she says.</span></div></div>",

Ari has only ever been rude and condescending to you. Why is she acting like this? Meanwhile she continues typing and stroking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cautiously walk over to look at her screen and sigh. She's up to her usual tactics., bending the truth in her article. \"What do you think?\" she asks. \"Ari, I really think you should stop making things up.\" you tell her. Instead of the usual threats she would give you, she offers a smile. You never thought you'd ever see her looking so sweet. \"Come on now, the people want something exciting.\" she says. You start to respond but she interrupts by resting her boobs on the desk in front of you. The big fluffy boobs of the sheep knock you off of your feet when they come down. \"Lets not argue Tim.\" she says as she twirls her finger above you. \"We should get a little closer.\" With that she pushes you into her boob. \"Now just relax while I work.\" she instructs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing you can't convince her otherwise right now you let her continue typing. Every now and then she pats your head while you watch from the desk. As weird as this situation is, its much better than your past experiences with Ari. When she finishes she stretches her arms out and sighs. \"Well thats done, now how about we have a little fun?\" she says. \"What do you-\" you begin before she picks you up. You see her cleavage getting closer and she drops you inside. You hate to admit it, but her fluffy wool feels amazing. Its so cozy.\"Enjoying yourself?\" she asks with a grin.\"Whats gotten into you Ari?\" you ask as she gets up from her chair. \"Nothing\" she answers. \"I just realized how cute you are.\" She walks away from her desk only to hear a voice from behind her. \"If you're finished your work then its my turn to have Tim.\" The voice belongs to...</span></div></div>",

She's got white fur like a polar bear, with blue lips and eyes and strawberry blond hair. \"Oh hey Ari.\" Emma says. \"You wouldn't mind if I spend a little more time with him right?\" Emma folds her arms. \"Come on, its my turn!\" she says. You wonder why Emma is so eager to work with you, but you're grateful to get away from this weirdness. \"Can I at least have him during lunch?\" Ari pleads, caressing you. Emma sighs. \"Fine, I was going to eat too anyway.\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giantesses head to the lunchroom and sit down at a table. Emma pulls out a bag from a fast food joint and takes out a burger. Ari meanwhile brings a tupperware bowl with a salad inside. Just as you think this isn't so bad she pulls out another container. When you open it you see its filled with humans. You watch from her breasts as she tosses one into her mouth. The scream he lets out is silenced when her mouth snaps shut. \"Looks like you're scaring him.\" Emma says as she chomps on her burger. Ari looks down and gets a little flustered. \"Oh! Don't worry Tim, I'd never eat you!\" she says reassuringly. Funny, you don't feel reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you share a little with me?\" Emma asks and grabs you from Ari's cleavage. \"Hey!\" the weresheep protests. Emma tears a piece of meat from her burger and offers it to you. You bite into it and find that its delicious.Its dinosaur meat with some kind of savory sauce. \"Too bad he's not a cannibal or he'd be able to share yours too.\" Emma teases. Ari pouts and grabs a small piece of cucumber. \"Have some.\" she says hopefully and shoves it in your face. You take a bite and give her a thumbs up. Monster vegetables are always better than human vegetables. As you eat in Emma's paw a huge pair of lips come down and give you a kiss. You're still a little shocked but are getting used to Ari's new attitude. Suddenly Emma's blue lips give you a smooch as well. That one surprises you. Both girls look at you lovingly as you wonder again what the hell is going on.</span></div></div>",

Your girlfriend gives you a scratch on the head and looks at Emma and Ari. \"Having fun guys?\" she asks. \"Oh yes, Tim is just the cutest little human!\" Ari tells her. \"Exactly! It would be a shame not to share him!\" Mazee says. You stare at the wererat in shock. Sure, agreeing to share you Destiny was a big step, but this is just crazy! \"Mazee, are you all right?\" you ask. \"Of course!\" she answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to understand what's going on, which is hard because you have three giant monsters staring at you.

Its a chubby mummy . \"Hey Cleotiti.\" you say, greeting her with a wave.The mummy gives a small yelp upon seeing you and hides behind Mazee. \"Still?\" you ask. \"I feel like we've known each other long enough for her to be comfortable around me.\" Mazee shrugs. \"Well she's scared of humans in general. One did set her on fire after all.\" she says. Cleotiti shrinks behind her even more. \"Besides, for a monster to be scared of such a small and powerless species in general, she had to have had self esteem problems in the first place.\" Jasmine says, offering her own two cents. You give her a slightly annoyed look at that \"small and powerless\" remark. \"Come on, you know I'm harmless, right?\" you try to reason with her. She nods and reaches out slowly, petting your head. She still looks rather nervous, but at least she's putting in an effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh at Cleotiti's reluctance, but then have an idea. \"Hey, can you help Cleotiti with her confidence problem?\" you ask. Everyone looks at you for a second. \"Well, I guess that could work.\" Mazee says. Jasmine is eagerly looking at the timid mummy with a smile. \"Thats easy! I'll have her over her little self esteem problem in no time!\" she says. Cleotiti however, doesn't look so sure. \"Um, I don't know. Genie wishes don't always work out as intended. Sometimes they twist things just to cause trouble.\" she says. Jasmine scoffs. \"Please, do I seem like one of those jerks? I promise I'll take good care of you okay?\" she tells her. The mummy is still hesitant. \"But if you're not experienced enough, something could go wrong.\" she says. \"Please, I'm plenty experienced!\" Jasmine pleads. Her eyes are big and full of hope. Unable to deny the neko, Cleotiti relents. \"O-okay...\" she says slowly. Jasmine claps her hand with a grin. After working her magic with a snap of her fingers a jar with a violet orb inside appears. \"What is that?\" you ask. \"Beats me.\" Jasmine says. \"But you conjured it up!\" Mazee says. \"Hey, I don't know what it is, but I do know it will make the mummy girl more confident.\" You and Mazee give her questioning looks while Cleotiti stares at the jar warily. \"Look, just trust me, okay?\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of you can say anything she opens the jar and the violet energy floats out.

So, where should we head first?\" With that, you begin the tour. You guide her around the office, showing her the ins and outs. In between you also try to get to know her. Turns out she also does freelance artwork on the side. \"I primarily do illustrations.\" she says. \"Sometimes for books, sometimes for magazines. I've even done caricatures before.\" You think thats actually pretty neat. \"Thats cool, why did you decide to come work here?\" you ask.

You must have hit a sore spot. \"I'm sorry.\" you say nervously. \"I didn't mean to-\" She then cuts you off. \"Its okay, I just get a little touchy about it. Might as well tell you since it'll probably get around eventually. My twin sister's name is Persephone.\" she says. \"The murderer?!\" you blurt out. You immediately regret your outburst, but you couldn't help it. \"Yes, the murderer. The CANNIBAL.\" she spits out with contempt. You're suddenly very uncomfortable.

Its been ages since the last time i ate a human. I just realized that there are better things to eat you know? And I won't eat my friends, so you're safe.\" Seems like you'll be okay around her.

If that thing caught us, we'd be dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHecate barks and nods her head. \"Yeah, but your bad luck can even undo a monster like that.\" You let out a laugh at that. That's when you notice a few photographs near Hecate's desk. One of which appeared to be a photograph of her and her relatives. Hecate wasn't kidding when she said she came from a large family. They appeared to be mainly women and most of them looked on the heavy side, which surprised you given how thin Hecate was. One of the girls was a brown furred werewolf girl with her hair down. She somewhat looked like Clawdeen Wolf, except for her heavy weight. From her outfit, this werewolf girl appeared to be a fashionista.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother of the girls appeared to be a gray furred werewolf with a reddish tint in her fur. She was wearing a red sweater and appeared to be brooding, obviously not a social person. Another of the wolf girls was a yellow furred werewolf girl who appeared to be wearing a red hood. Next to her was a pear shaped werewolf resembling a dire wolf, with her hair worn in a ponytail. She seemed to be wearing a bikini and seashell necklace. Another wolf girl was completely naked except for the paint covering her fur and even then, she looked more like a giant collie than a werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHecate herself was in the photo and was at the side of an obese silver furred and blue haired werewolf woman who appeared to be older than most of the other wolves in the photo. You take it the silver wolf was Hecate's mother. But when you look at the other side of the silver wolf, you see that the photograph appears to have been folded, though you could make out a white furred foot. You realize that must've been Persephone, Hecate's cannibalistic sister. Obviously, Hecate had some bad blood with her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut next to that large family portrait, you notice another photograph that appears to depict Hecate and Persephone as wolf cubs playing with a beach ball. They seemed much happier then. You wonder what the heck went wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Hecate finally finishes typing and looks down at you.</span></div></div>",

For a second you see anger flash across her normally mellow face, then she sighs. \"There's not really much to say. She's a cannibalistic criminal.\" she says with her arms folded. \"Yeah, but she wasn't always like that right? In that picture it looks like she was a normal cub like you.\" you say. Hecate picks up the photo and looks at it. She has a nostalgic expression which she quickly gets rid of. \"I guess she wasn't always like that. We actually used to be pretty close.\" she says. She then looks over and sees the interested look on your face and picks you up. \"Fine, I'll tell you about her. Don't get any funny ideas though, I don't want my family's business in the paper.\" she tells you as she sits down on the sofa. \"Don't worry, you can trust me.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay back when we were kids we were pretty inseparable. She was always a little aggressive though. When the boys teased us I would just ignore them, but Persephone couldn't. Our mom got quite a few calls about her beating up the neighborhood boys.\" She laughs a little when she says this. \"Even so, she never really got punished too bad. Mom knew she was just sticking up for us. There was one time when she and my cousin Selene got into an all out brawl with some punks.\" You're fascinated by this. You never thought you'd hear the story behind the infamous Persephone. \"She was really great at painting too, just like I draw. Our mom taught us how, she's a great artist. Me and Persephone were kind of a team. I could draw and she could paint. We did some awesome work together.\" Hecate's face takes a gloomy turn as she remembers more. \"Then she became a criminal. One day she got into fight with some minotaur boy when we were teenagers. She bit him good and apparently liked the taste. She just kept eating and eating until I pulled her off of him. They arrested her and let her go under the grounds that she was acting in self defense. They made her undergo a psychological evaluation but they didn't find anything unusual. Things at home were normal, then that same minotaur came up missing. After a couple of weeks the police ended up at our house. When they asked her Persephone just admitted it, like she didn't even care. Then they took her away and locked her up. When we went to visit her we found out she escaped and was on the run, and its been like that ever since.\" You stare wide eyed at Hecate as she spins her tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't appear to be over, as she keeps going. \"Mom took it real hard. She was a wreck, crying and forgetting things. Eventually she accepted it somewhat. She went back to her sweet self, but still has a problems with her memory. I kind of think she wants to forget so bad that she forgets everything. Ironically she works at the KDP. Maybe she just wants to help people like Persephone.\" Then her tone gets angry and she gets louder. \"Its all her fault! She knew what she was doing when she confessed and she still does! Mom took it the hardest but the rest of the family was torn up too. We've always been a close family, so it hit us all. Then after hearing about her crimes on the news and in the paper I realized she just doesn't care! The worst part is that every time she gets away from the authorities she drops in on a family member like its no big deal! Everyone else may still accept her, but I don't. We had a couple of big fights until she learned to stop coming to me. She drove our mother over the edge and hurt us all! She basically abandoned us!\" You see a single tear in her eye before she quickly wipes it away. Seems like her hatred of her sister comes from the fact that she left her and her mother without a thought. Their family seems pretty close knit, judging from the way she says they all reacted. Hell, even Persephone sounds like she still cares about them, since she still visits when she can. That doesn't change the fact that she's a murderer, but its kind of nice in a way. It also sounds like Hecate is the only one in the family who's ever turned her away. She must have taken it harder than the rest, after her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that little session Hecate pets your head. \"And thats it. Promise you won't tell anyone.\" she says. \"I won't.\" you tell her. She then brings her face in closer. \"I mean it, you can't tell anyone. Not even your girlfriend.\" she says. She's serious. The fact that she told you must mean she trusts you a lot. \"Don't worry, I promise.\" you repeat. After winding down....</span></div></div>",

Hecate walks towards her bed that you see was ironically twin sized.\" \"Huh,\" you say. \"That's an usually large bed for one wolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHecate hangs her head down. \"I like my space,\" she says. \"I used to... bunk with.... you know...\" You're starting to wish that you didn't bring up Persephone. As much as Hecate says she hates her sister, you could tell she was still sad to hear about what happened to her. \"Hecate,\" you say. \"I'm really sorry about...\" \"It doesn't matter now,\" says Hecate. \"Persephone's days are numbered. One of these days, it'll be over.\" You gasped at the sound of that. Although you shouldn't be surprised. Monsters take cannibalism very seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look around to change the subject as Hecate is putting on her pajamas. \"Uh Hecate,\" you say. \"Where am I supposed to sleep?\" Hecate's tail sticks up and she thinks about that before she takes out a scarf and wraps it around you before putting you next to her alarm clock. \"There,\" she says before she climbs into bed herself. \"I just hope your girlfriend doesn't...\" You let out a laugh. \"She wouldn't mind. I already live with her best friend. Specifically, I live <i>in</i> her best friend.\" Hecate raises an eyebrow in confusion. \"Uh, she's a bunyip,\" you say. \"I live in Willa's pouch.\" \"You live in another monster's pouch?\" asks Hecate. \"Hey, the rent's okay.\" \"She charges you rent to live in her pouch?\" asks Hecate more baffled. Then she lets out a yawn. \"Well, good night Tim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she turns off the light and you both drift off to dream land.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you and Hecate were sleeping, elsewhere, near Under Gloom, the most vile prison known to Mons-Terra, alarms are blaring. Somebody had managed to escape. From the ground arose two monsters who had apparently dug a tunnel. From their orange jumpsuits, they were obviously escaping convicts. One of them was a cockatrice, a monster with the upper body of a Rhode Island Red chicken and the lower body of a purple lizard and the other monster was an albino werewolf; Hecate's sister, Persephone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone sniffs the air and lets out a sigh through her muzzle. \"It's good to be free.\" She says. The cockatrice prisoner lets out a squawk as the search lights shine near them. \"Come on Persephone,\" she says. \"We've got to get the heck out of here before old Demona finds out we're trying to escape.\" Persephone lets out a sigh. \"First,\" she says as she points to the muzzle. \"Get this damn muzzle off of me. I'd attract too much attention with it.\" The cockatrice woman clucks before plucking one of her own feathers and she uses it to pick the lock on Persephone's muzzle. Once the muzzle falls off, Persephone exhales and smiles to show her sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Pers,\" says the cockatrice. \"Now we better get out of here as fast as possible.\" However, Persephone lets out a growl to her partner's confusion. \"First thing's first,\" says the white wolf woman with a malicious grin. \"I'm starving.\" Persephone growls and then tackles the cockatrice, piercing her neck with her teeth and pushing her to the ground before she begins eating. Once her accomplice is reduced to bones, Persephone lets out a thunderous belch and wipes the good off her mouth. \"Tastes like chicken.\" She says. The searchlight then shines before Persephone growls and scurries away on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you are riding on Hecate's shoulder as everyone passes her. Harley walks out carrying newspapers and Hecate picks up one and smiles because her Slender Monster story made the front page. Another of the interns, Bea Zebub, a succubus, walks by and holds a thumb up at Hecate. \"You go girl.\" Says Bea. Then Persephone starts to walk into the cubicle area. Yulong, the dragoness raises her head and smiles. \"It would appear the new intern has already made an impact on the editor.\" Says the elderly oriental dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is at this moment that most of the monster girls get up to congratulate Hecate. \"I had no idea such a strange creature was living in the woods,\" says Anna-Maria as she holds up her tentacles and waves several flags. \"Who knew.\" \"We may be looking at the first cryptic beast known to monsters,\" says Willa. \"And since I'm a cryptic meself, that speaks volume Sheila.\" Emma walks forward and tries to shake hands with Hecate but grabs the wolf woman's tail by mistake due to her bad eyesight and makes Hecate growl slightly. \"My mistake.\" Says Emma sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan Li the pandaren speaks in Chinese to compliment Hecate as Blake purrs. \"Girl,\" says Blake. \"You're going to fit right in.\" The only reporters not congratulating Hecate were Tara and Ari. Tara lets out a hiss as she tries to put her makeup on. How she does that when she doesn't have reflection, you don't know. Ari bleats angrily. \"It's disgusting,\" says the weresheep. \"Faaaaauning over that maaaaaangy wolf.\" Tara hisses again. \"You said it Ari. Werewolves are nothing more that flea infested, tree pissing, stink machines. Why can't they be more like the elegant vampire.\" What worse is that she's friends with that face melting little cockroach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMazee walks forward and smiles at Hecate before the two of them sit down to talk and Hecate hands you back to your girlfriend. Mazee smiles and strokes your head before she speaks with Hecate. \"Well Hecate, you got famous real quick.\" Hecate lets out a laugh. \"To be honest Mazee, Tim's bad luck is the only reason we made it out alive. We could've been killed by that.. whatever it was.\" Mazee smiles at you and shows her teeth. \"Ooh, looks like my man's a hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh nervously but then you see Fate walk in and she looked armed to the teeth and was even carrying a gun that she was polishing. Hecate looks at Fate in fear. \"Who's the fat purple gargoyle gal with the chip on her shoulder?\" \"Oh,\" says Mazee. \"It's only Fate, the night guard. She always shows up real early. Total workaholic that girl.\" \"Fate?\" asks Hecate. \"Any relationship to Destiny Sirtis?\" \"Uh yeah,\" you say. \"Destiny's her mom.\" Hecate lets out a gulp. \"I can see the family resemblance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fate is walking away, she drops something from her belt and Hecate runs over to help her. \"Excuse me!\" she yells. \"Fate! You drop your.... Ah!\" Hecate takes one look at the object Fate dropped and jumps back in fear. The object Fate dropped was none other than a silver bullet. \"What's wrong Hecate?\" asks Mazee. \"S-Si-S-S...\" You look at the ground and see the bullet. \"A silver bullet,\" you say in surprise. \"A werewolf's worst nightmare.\" Silver bullets were illegal in some places in the monster world, but Fearfield wasn't one of them. Most monsters would steer clear of these things, especially werewolves. One shot of a silver bullet and a wolf is dead as dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate walks back and then picks up the bullet from the ground. \"I'd be careful if I were you,\" says the gargoyle woman. \"As soon as you punch out, go straight home, lock your doors and windows. But if you feel the need to stop at the store, don't forget to pick up a jar of aconite.\" Fate then walks away as you look in confusion. \"What's aconite?\" you ask. \"It's a purple flower,\" says Mazee. \"Otherwise known as.... wolfsbane.\" Mazee's eyes pop. It sounded like Fate was telling her and you what to do in case of a werewolf attack. All you knew was that something bad was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Lexi calls over the loudspeaker...</span></div></div>",

Everyone starts murmuring, wondering whats going on. \"Um, Fate?\" you ask. Mazee carries you over to the gargoyle, since Hecate is keeping her distance from the silver bullet. \"What exactly is going on?\" Fate looks at you, then past you at Hecate. With a sigh she comes clean. \"A dangerous criminal escaped from Under Gloom, and the whole city is on alert.\" she says. \"The whole city? How bad can this guy be?\" Mazee asks. \"She's a psychotic cannibal who's claimed hundreds of victims.\" Hecate's eyes go wide and you can guess who Fate is talking about. \"You don't mean...\" Fate nods. \"Yup. Persephone.\" Hecate's face goes through a series of changes. First she looks shocked, then sad, and then angry. \"That bitch escaped!? How did she get out of Under Gloom? Its supposed to be the best prison around!\" she says. \"Believe me, my mom is having a fit right now. She's working everyone up there like crazy.\" Fate tells her. \"Well, I guess we should get home as fast as we can.\" Mazee says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all leave the building, Mazee cradling you in her paws. \"Tim, I think I want you to stay with me tonight okay?\" she says. \"Sure.\" you tell her. \"We'll call Willa when we get there and let her know.\" You pass Fate on the way out and call to her. \"Will you be okay Fate?\" you ask. She gives you a small smile. \"Don't worry. That cannibal can't eat me. Gargoyles have tough skin.\" she tells you. As Mazee nears her car she goes to open the door. Just as she does a white paw grabs her hand. \"Hey there.\" the owner says and shoves Mazee away. Standing there is a tall white werewolf with red eyes. Persephone! Mazee back up and begins to run but Persephone catches up easily and grabs her. With her physique the wolfess looks like she could definitely outrun your girlfriend. \"Time for dinner\" she says. Then she spots you clutched in Mazee's hands. \"Oooh! And an after dinner snack!\" Before she can go any further you hear a snarling sound. Persephone's nose twitches and she lets go of Mazee for a second. In that instant a black shape tackles her to the ground. Looking closer you see that its Hecate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis! I thought I smelled you, but I was too hungry to check around!\" Persephone says as they roll around. \"You should have turned tail the second you caught my scent!\" Hecate yells. They start clawing at each other and trying to land punches but they seem pretty evenly matched. It actually looks like a fight between two quarreling sisters. Persephone doesn't even seem to be worried, she's just trying to chat with Hecate. Hecate on the other hand looks pissed beyond belief. The normally calm werewolf is snarling and growling as she grapples with her twin. Its all a blur of black and white. You and Mazee are too transfixed to even call for Fate. \"You walked out on us to be a criminal! Don't act like its not a big deal!\" Hecate shouts. \"Aww come on. Nobody else in the family seems to hate me.\" Persephone counters. \"Besides, I still love you guys.\" The two wolves continue their battle until...</span></div></div>",

The gargoyle approaches the sisters and makes a grab at Persephone. She misses and is scratched by Hecate's claws. \"Are you okay?\" you ask. \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" she says. It didn't leave a scratch thanks to her tough skin. Meanwhile the two wolves didn't even notice her. Fate is about to try again when Persephone looks up and spots her. \"A gargoyle?! Come on!\" she moans. The distraction allows Hecate to roll on top of her and land a good punch, knocking her out. She doesn't stop there though, and delivers another two or three blows before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, want to hit her some more?\" Fate says as she walks over. \"Don't tempt me.\" Hecate responds. Fate handcuffs Persephone and picks her up off of the ground. As she does the white wolf's eyes open. Man, she recovered fast. \"What the-?\" she says at her situation. \"You're heading back to Under Gloom.\" Fate tells her. Persephone moans and then looks at Hecate. \"Well you got me sis. Lucky for you this chubby  clawfoot showed up.\" she says. She's probably right. It looked like they would be fighting forever if something hadn't happened. Hecate  glares at her sister, who smiles in return. Then she frowns as she looks back at Fate. \"I am a little mad that I have to go back to old Demona's prison though.\" she says. \"She's excited to see you too.\" Fate tells her sarcastically. She then takes Persephone away. \"Love you sis! See you later!\" she calls out as she goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you stand there silently until Mazee speaks up. \"Thank you so much.

Yeah.\" she says quickly. She's obviously trying to hide it but you can tell she's glad. As much as she hates her she doesn't want her sister dead. \"I'm sure the warden will really let her have it.\" Mazee says. You all say goodnight and begin to head out.

Worried that she would yell at you for what happened, you walked to her office, hoping she won't be too mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there, you see that Lexi is not alone. Sitting in a chair on the side is someone you never met. She had long green hair tied in a ponytail, brown eyes, and silver scales all over her body. She had webbed hands and there was a dorsal fin on her back. She was wearing a blue suit. You could see that she had average breasts and a pot belly, but you could also see that she had a HUGE butt and thighs. Sitting down, it looked like she was 3 feet above the chair. She was holding what looked like a monster sized DS and she was really focused on it. Lexi cleared her throat and your attention was pulled to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim, I want to introduce you to Mar. She is a Iara transfer from Brazil. She is going to be working here as a video game critic.\" Lexi told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Video game critic? But we already have an entertainment section. Blake is the one working on it.\" You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is true. But I'm trying to update the paper so we can sell to a broader demographic. Blake refuses to review video games, so we have hired Mar to do it. She's had expirence in the field.\" Lexi explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to show her around the office. Don't screw this up, or I'm sending you on an assignment in Under Gloom. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. Under Gloom was a prison, and with all the inmates there, you were afraid that if you went, you'd never come back. \"Yes, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" She said.

By some luck you managed to trick a giant sphinx into employing you to do odd jobs at the town newspaper, the Daily Tombstone. This however is a problematic job due to both your ineptitude and the fact that every last one of your coworkers is a monster giantess. Surprisingly despite being one hundredth of the size of most of your coworkers you\u2019ve managed to unintentionally cause some many accidents that the building can\u2019t be insured anymore. Needless to say, your life in Fearfield is far from uneventful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Editor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Lexi Luxor<br>\r\nSpecies: Sphinx<br>\r\nHeight: 850ft (On all fours/Full height unknown)<br>\r\nAppearance: A titanic sphinx with violet fur, long gray hair and large feathered wings bigger than she is. Wears a lavender business dress with a pair of circular glasses. Unlike other monsters, Lexi walks on all fours rather than upright if only because of her species.<br>\r\nDescription: Lexi is the editor of the Daily Tombstone and your employer. She hired you because she lost a bet when you answered the riddle she gave you. Lexi is the primary victim of the accidents you cause and has come to expect the worst because you somehow manage to get her seriously hurt through your bumbling. While she tries to hide it, the sphinx despises you for the misery you throw her way and mainly sends you on your missions in the hopes that she\u2019ll get rid of you. She is a predator, but you\u2019re just the one human she can\u2019t eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Field Reporters- Your main job involves acting as a photographer to get into places where the monsters are much too big to fit and helping the reporters in the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Mazee Robinson<br>\r\nSpecies: Wererat<br>\r\nHeight: 500ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant and very fat wererat girl with black fur and long bluish black hair that reaches to her long pink tail. For clothes she wears blue jeans with a gray shirt and red vest.<br>\r\nDescription: Mazee is your girlfriend and the one monster on the crew least likely to harm you. She\u2019s arguably the only sane monster on the Daily Tombstone and is somewhat snarky in regards to her coworkers. Mazee mainly keeps you out of trouble, specifically, protecting you against predatory monsters. While very friendly towards humans and a loyal girlfriend, the wererat giantess can be a real terror when angered or drunk and you know that all too well after being together for months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Willa Bong<br>\r\nSpecies: Bunyip<br>\r\nHeight: 500ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A pudgy yellow green skinned monster resembling a scaly furless kangaroo with no tail and the face of a fanged frog with pointy ears.

There\u2019s a pouch under her navel she uses to carry you around. She also has a long frog like tongue she uses to catch bugs.<br>\r\nDescription: Willa is Mazee\u2019s best friend, though she has trouble figuring out what Mazee sees in a tiny human like you. She\u2019s also your apartment roommate, or more accurate, your dwelling since you mostly live in her pouch. Willa is also your landlady because of this but she\u2019s an understanding one and prefers to leave you alone so she doesn\u2019t have to interact with you. Speaks in an Australian accent due to her heritage as an Outback monster<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Pan Li<br>\r\nSpecies: Pandaren<br>\r\nHeight: 850ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A titaness resembling a giant panda girl with her hair tied into a bun and ponytail. Typically wears a purple Chinese dress and sandals with black lipstick. Being a panda, she is really bulky and fat in body shape but mostly in her stomach.<br>\r\nDescription: You don\u2019t really know what Pan Li thinks about you since she doesn\u2019t speak English, though she can understand it. She mainly covers the Eastern side of Fearfield and can be quite territorial towards the other reporters in that regard, although she isn\u2019t openly hostile towards you. While some monsters have told you Pan Li was friendly, you heard rumors that Pan Li was a predator. Since you can\u2019t understand the panda giantess, you don\u2019t know what to believe. There\u2019s a rumor she served time in Under Gloom but the charges weren\u2019t specified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Anna-Maria Blum<br>\r\nSpecies: Kraken<br>\r\nHeight: 475ft<br>\r\nAppearance: From the top she resembles an hourglass shaped tan skinned woman with large messy hot pink hair while from the waist down she has the tentacles of a giant squid. Eight of the tentacles are hot pink while the two longest ones are white<br>\r\nDescription: Anna-Maria is an absent minded and somewhat ditzy monster who claims to have psychic powers. Nobody believes her, including you and you don\u2019t like to work with her much because you think she\u2019s crazy. Tends to spray ink when spazzed out and you\u2019ve almost drowned in that black goop numerous times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Tara Gordon<br>\r\nSpecies: Vampire<br>\r\nHeight: 550ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A pear shaped vampire girl with long blonde hair and purple eyes. Looks almost human except for her chalk white skin, fangs and pointed ears. Wears tight purple jeans with a black Batgirl shirt. Half of her face is horribly scarred due to sunlight exposure which almost proved fatal.<br>\r\nDescription: Tara despises you fiercely for all the accidents you caused, because one time, you were cleaning the window behind her desk and accidentally broke it, letting in sunlight that scarred her face and nearly disintegrated her. You think she wants revenge on you for her facial damage and near death experience because every time she sees you, she\u2019s rubbing her fangs. Extremely volatile temper to the point of mistaking compliments for insults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Ari Wooller<br>\r\nSpecies: Weresheep <br>\r\nHeight: 660ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A heavy set sheep giantess with red wool all over her body, with an afro like mass of wool forming hair on her head and long curved horns. Mainly wears a black skirt with a white polka dotted shirt.<br>\r\nDescription: Ari is one of your least favorite coworkers because she sees humans as little more than slaves. She is a shady and somewhat dishonest journalist prone to making up lies and exaggerating in her reports, in turn leading her articles to show false information. It\u2019s a wonder Lexi hasn\u2019t found her out and fired her. She\u2019s that good a liar. You want to report Ari to Lexi but every time you act insubordinate towards the weresheep, she threatens to eat you and has more than once held you over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Misc.

Almost identical to her older twin Nefernina except with long green hair and darker skin. Wears an Egyptian style skirt with scarab shaped earrings. Looks in her twenties but she\u2019s much older than the rest of the monsters in the building.<br>\r\nDescription: Unlike her sister, Cleotiti is very sweet, arguably the nicest girl in the news building. She was hired to write a fashion column to attract female readers. However Cleo is deathly afraid of humans because she was the monster Wade from Monster Gaol set on fire and because of the traumatic experience, she has a panic attack whenever she so much as sees a human to the point of violence. Being Nefernina\u2019s sister, Cleotiti can use magic, but she usually prefers not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Grace Bass<br>\r\nSpecies: Werecheetah<br>\r\nHeight: 675ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A pear shaped werecheetah with yellow and black spotted fur and matching hair with a white furred face.

She has a big appetite befitting her profession but you\u2019re afraid to work with her because you\u2019ve seen her eat humans several times in different ways and fully enjoy them. While the werecheetah acts friendly towards you, you\u2019re convinced one day when you let your guard down, she\u2019s going to devour you on the job because she licks her lips whenever she sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Yulong Ming<br>\r\nSpecies: Chinese Dragon<br>\r\nHeight: 850ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A long muscle bound Chinese dragon with bright green scales with silver hair that she has arranged in Chun-Li style buns and small silver antlers. She wears a white Chinese dress with a skirt.  <br>\r\nDescription: Yulong is perhaps the wisest monster in Fearfield and her job is to answer questions in the advice column of the Daily Tombstone. Unlike most of the other staff, Yulong isn\u2019t bothered by the accidents you cause, even when she is the victim of them. Being a Chinese dragon, she is very peaceful towards humans but she can get annoyed if she is compared to the more barbaric western dragons. She\u2019s also the only one who understands Pan Li.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Emma Frostclaw<br>\r\nSpecies: Werebear<br>\r\nHeight: 950ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An enormous werebear resembling a polar bear with blue eyes and lips and strawberry blonde hair. For clothing she wears a white jacket, shirt and spandex pants that blend into her fur.<br>\r\nDescription: Emma is in charge of the sports section of the paper and when you\u2019re assigned to work with her, you accompany her to the sporting events that take place in Fearfield. She has a tendency to take the sports too seriously and acts more masculine that feminine. While she\u2019s friendly with you, she often forgets how tiny you are and has trouble seeing you due to mildly bad eyesight because she\u2019s too vain to wear glasses. More often than not, she accidentally pushes you into the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Blake Williams<br>\r\nSpecies: Weretiger<br>\r\nHeight: 800ft<br>\r\nAppearance: An obese orange-red furred weretigress with long red hair reaching past her shoulders.

However she wears a pair of tiger\u2019s eye earrings and a necklace.<br>\r\nDescription: Blake is the entertainment critic in charge of judging plays, spectacles and movies. She has the hots for you and doesn\u2019t accept the fact you already have a girlfriend to the point where she questions what you could possibly see in a rodent of unusual size and flirts with you constantly. Blake is determined to steal you away from Mazee and make you her husband and will go to any length to do so. You\u2019re the reason she doesn\u2019t wear clothes. Needless to say, Blake and Mazee hate each other. She is the cousin of Kath of Monster Shores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Other Staff- Sometimes Lexi makes you do odd jobs such as helping out the rest of the staff. This is the part of the staff not involved in writing the newspaper. You don\u2019t like working with them that much because most of them stress you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Harley Bacon<br>\r\nSpecies: Wereboar<br>\r\nHeight: 750ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A giant fat wereboar with yellow orange fur with black spots and white hair worn in a fauxhawk and ponytail. She also sports large tusks as long as her snout. Mainly wears tight black leather that\u2019s obviously too small for her large body.<br>\r\nDescription: You think she\u2019s Brazilian, if pig girls the size of skyscrapers can be Brazilian. Harley was hired to deliver newspapers because she was the only one to apply for the job. You sometimes accompany her on her motorcycle. While Harley is the fastest delivery girl in Fearfield and overly friendly around humans, you\u2019re scared to go with her because she drives like a psychopath and usually places you in some unsecure areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Kiki Nook<br>\r\nSpecies: Tanuki<br>\r\nHeight: 700ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A large obese grey furred tanuki with black stripes and black hair worn in a bun. Wears a rose colored business dress similar to Lexi\u2019s except obviously bigger. Like all tanukis, she has black markings around her face resembling a mask.<br>\r\nDescription: Kiki is Lexi\u2019s secretary, though she is very apathetic about her job. Working with her is extremely dangerous because the tanuki woman is completely oblivious and indifferent to the fact a tiny human works in the building and has nearly eaten or squashed you countless times. It really doesn\u2019t help that she acts as if you\u2019re not even there even when you\u2019re directly in her line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Aurelia Macbeth-Nile<br>\r\nSpecies: Werejackal<br>\r\nHeight: 600ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A tall and hourglass shaped Egyptian style werejackal with teal colored fur and long rose colored hair.

Namely repairing the damages your clumsiness has caused to both the building itself and any machines. Aurelia is married to Cree from Monster Gaol and shares her much larger werehyena wife\u2019s sadistic and predatory attitude in regards to humans, except she\u2019s more calm-headed about it and not as hyperactive as Cree. You really don\u2019t like working with her because every other time you\u2019re assigned to her, she tries to eat you and at one point she actually did have you halfway down her throat. You only escaped because she sneezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Fate Sirtis<br>\r\nSpecies: Gargoyle<br>\r\nHeight: 1000ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A heavy set indigo skinned gargoyle with large leathery wings, a lizard\u2019s tail and six small almost underdeveloped looking horns on her forehead.

Fate\u2019s job is to keep thieves and spies out of the news building. While she\u2019s non aggressive towards humans, you wouldn\u2019t consider Fate good company because she rarely speaks, always has a stoic look on her face and acts more like a soldier than a security guard when it comes to her job. She\u2019s also the daughter of Warden Destiny from Monster Gaol and shares her mother\u2019s dedication. When Lexi pairs you up with Fate, your main purpose is to act as a second set of eyes and you usually have to stay after hours since Fate mainly comes in at night when everyone else has gone home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Beth Forte<br>\r\nSpecies: Behemoth<br>\r\nHeight: 1000ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A titanic tan yellowish skinned behemoth.

She sports a noticeable tattoo of a skull on her right butt cheek.<br>\r\nDescription: Beth is another guard like Fate except she mainly comes in during the day. However, Beth likes humans to know who\u2019s in charge and loves to dominate you, mainly by crushing you and playing with you in her mouth. However, like Blake, Beth is trying to steal you from Mazee, only she does it by acting like a dominatrix. You\u2019ve even seen her bring a whip to work that she loved pulling out on you. There\u2019s even a rumor you\u2019re not the first human that caught her eye and the last one didn\u2019t survive her treatment. Beth doesn\u2019t take her job as seriously as Fate but the two of them get along to a degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0New Characters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Beatrice \"Bea\" Zebub<br>\r\nSpecies: Succubus<br>\r\nHeight: 700ft<br>\r\nAppearance: A gigantic purple skinned succubus with long black hair down to the small of her back.

Bea is one of five new interns working for the building and surprisingly seems non-malicious for a succubus and doesn't appear to eat souls like the rest of her species.
