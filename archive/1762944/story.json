You were a friendly and easygoing guy.  You were also smart, adventurous and hedonistic.  During your teenage years, you had a good understanding of how the stock market and economy worked.  Thanks to this, and several smart investments, you made your first million by the time you were 18.  You quickly became a highly-successful billionaire stockbroker.  However, it wasn't long before your newfound wealth began attracting some unwanted attention, including your friends and family trying to take advantage of you, much to your irritation.  Shortly after you turned 21, you eventually disappeared from public life and became a recluse.  You were now living in a secluded, but luxurious villa on a remote private island located in the Caribbean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat in a lounge chair on the beach, sipping on a strawberry daiquiri as you watched the sun set behind the ocean.  You sighed heavily as you took another sip from your drink.  While you were comfortable living on the island, you were starting to feel a bit lonely.  After finishing your drink, you stood up and slipped on your bathrobe.  You were just about to retreat back into the villa when suddenly,</span></div></div>",

Sure, it got lonely every now and then, but that's the price you pay for peace and tranquility. Suddenly, you were shaken from your peaceful thoughts by the sight of a quick flash of light off in the distance. You tried to shake it off, but then you saw it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in frustration. Probably paparazzi or something, you thought as you pushed yourself to your feet to shoo away the intruders. You took the few short steps from your porch to the beachline, but as you got closer, your mouth dropped in shock at what you saw. The flashes of light were coming from the last few remnants of sunlight bouncing off an incredibly large metallic vehicle that was slowly rolling out of the sea onto your property! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but continue toward the awe inspiring piece of machinery. You had never seen anything like it, and you needed to get closer. As you drew closer, the vehicle stopped suddenly, but you continued your trek until you found yourself against what you assumed was a door. It, like the vehicle, was incredibly large. You hesitated for a moment, but lifted your hand and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door suddenly clanged open, revealing a large creature shrouded in darkness on the inside. You were never the tallest person, but the figure inside the vehicle would tower over any professional athlete. Before you could get a word out, your world went dark as you found yourself unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you slowly and lazily woke up. It felt like you were lying back on a metal table. Instead of opening your eyes you chose to focus on the sounds around you. Distinctly female voices disagreeing about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said the island was uninhabited!\" a commanding voice seethed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....uh....well the scanners said it was!\" a second voice meekly responded. \"Maybe it picked up his small size and identified him as an animal? Or....maybe he's the only human on the island and the scanner just....missed him?\" she searched for a rational explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, regardless, he'll have to stay with us now. Maybe he can give us some answers on the island and his planet while we await orders from headquarters,\" the commanding voice responded, still sounding irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of having to stay, your body twitched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Quiet you two!\" a third voice jumped in. \"I think he's awake!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you were caught, you slowly opened your eyes. What you saw caused you to gasp. The women....if you could call them that....were definitely animals. But they all stood on two legs and had distinctly human features. They were all also incredibly tall and curvaceous. Your eyes slowly scanned the room and you saw a hippo, a kangaroo, a horse, and a rabbit surrounding your table. It was like you woke up in the most random startup zoo ever. You were filled with questions, but you were not the first to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was?</span></div></div>",

What's going on!?\" you protest. \"I'm Brent Weller, one of the richest men in the world! You can't treat me like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHela just chuckled until she tossed you onto a large medical table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brent is it? I'm Hela, head of medical here on the ship. I'm going to give you a quick exam, but first you need to be treated if you're going to survive with us,\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she continued, \"When was the last time you had something to eat or drink?\" she asked, while digging through some drawers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...well, I was drinking a daiquiri just before I saw your..uh...ship,\" you answered stammering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo frowned. \"That was just a few hours ago...\" she said thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hours!?\" you exclaimed. You had no idea you were out for that long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and alcohol as well. Well, I guess we'll have to do the direct injection,\" she said with a shrug. \"Eh, it's faster acting anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned with a smile, brandishing an intimidatingly large syringe. You again tried to protest, but Hela's strength was too much for you as she jabbed you with the syringe. You screamed in pain before breathing in relief as she finally released you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your limbs get all wobbly before you finally regained your bearings. You looked up and gulped as you saw the hippo looking down on you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to test it. Catch me Brent!\" she calls before turning and leaping at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shot wide open as you saw Hela's massive ass careening toward you. You threw your hands up to protect yourself, but to no one's surprise it was hopeless. Her flesh was overwhelming and crushed you flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHela's face alternated between a smile and a frown. \"Well, no super strength I guess, but from what I can tell,\" she started with a shift of her hips, \"Your form is perfectly malleable.\" The hippo smiled broadly as she felt your flattened form squish beneath her backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were helpless beneath her, only to hope for mercy. </span></div></div>",

You have to look up to see it as her thick thighs fill your view as you turn to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...well, I...wait!\" You started to answer her, when you quickly realized that something was off. \"How did you know my name?!\" you asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro 'roo chuckled. \"We were busy while you were napping Brent. Your earthly laws of physics wouldn't have done you many favors here with us, so we made some slight...ah...adjustments to your physiology. You'll find life with us much more survivable now,\" she said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we found your wallet while we were at it. Do all humans carry around so much green paper with pictures of other men?\" the rabbit asked happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least that answers how they got your name, although it left many more worrying questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, no.  They don't,\" you answered shaking your head somewhat wearily. \"And to answer your other question, I feel...well....fine. A little tired maybe, but fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's to be expected,\" the hippo says matter of factly, \"A simple side effect,\" she says as if you had just taken Asprin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your head is still spinning with questions, the horse interjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, enough of the chit chat. Cara, take Brent to see his new quarters. The rest of you have some work to be doing, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the crew on the ship give some form of affirmative response and get busy, or start looking busy. Cara, apparently the kangaroo, is the only one hesitating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Captain, but...new quarters?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse looks up and down the 'roo's body with a smile. You completely miss the look, but Cara does not, responding in kind with a smile of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, right away Captain. This way Brent!\" she calls to you, pulling you off the table and down the nearby hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCara holds you close to her body as she escorts you through the ship. You feel her thick, soft curves rub up against your much smaller body as she walks. You try to interject with questions about whatever they did to you while you were unconscious, but Cara simply ignores them and continues pointing out features of the ship. Finally, she stops in a long hallway in front of a tall doorway. It opens without the 'roo having to lift as much as a finger. She prods you through the open door and you see a lavishly decorated room. The door slams shut ominously immediately as the two of you walk through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around in confusion. Why would your new room be decorated already? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she was reading your mind, Cara smiles and answers your unasked question. \"Welcome to my room Brent!\" she says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, your room? I thought you were showing me to my quarters?\" you asked. Things on this boat never seem to follow logic as you would expect it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I am,\" Cara says as she slowly circles you. \"I just thought we should be somewhere private first. You see, your quarters are right....here....\" she says, drawing out her last two words as she rubs her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait....you're going to eat me!?\" you ask in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCara looks at you in confusion, then down at her body, and then laughs. \"Oh! No!\" she exclaims with a laugh. \"You're not going in <i>here</i>\" she says patting her stomach, \"You're going in <i>here</i>!\" she says, pulling out the fleshy fold of the pouch that she was actually rubbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were relieved to know that you weren't about to be devoured, you weren't exactly relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you exclaim, \"I can't live in your....in your pouch!\" you beg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCara just smiles and continues to circle you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do have other options if you'd prefer,\" she responds, patting her massive round ass. Your eyes shoot wide open once again. That option seems exponentially worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's OK Brent, you don't have to decide right away. I'm sure we can find some way to kill a little time...\" she says, letting her words drift.</span></div></div>",

Cara hasn't left you with much of a choice here. \"Ok Cara,\" you relent, \"The pouch it is,\" you say dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo jumped at you with a huge smile on her face. You tried to back away, but she was far too fast. She wrapped you up in her arms and held you tightly against her abundant chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not just any pouch,\" Cara laughs, \"I think you'll find my pouch to be quite...warm,\" she says, squeezing you with a loving caress. \"Not just anybody gets to stay there you know,\" she says soothingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to respond, but your words are muffled to silence by her flesh. Cara continues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be treated to a lot of...unique opportunities Brent,\" she says with a smile. \"But you'll always come back to this one. I might never have a little Joey of my own, but I have a feeling that you'll feel the void quite nicely,\" she finishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, she silently peels her tight fleshy pocket from against her body and releases her hold on you, letting you fall into her pouch before letting it snap shut. You yelped as you fell, but swallowed your voice when you landed. You were surprised by how accurate Cara's prediction was. Her pouch was shockingly warm and cozy. It was a bit uncomfortably sticky, but despite that, you felt yourself wanting to curl up and take a nap. You felt Cara's hand happily massaging your back from the outside of her pouch, moaning in a sign that she was as comfortable as you are. </span></div></div>",

What did you hear?\" she asks. It was more of a command than a question. Hers was the irritated, commanding voice you heard when you kept your eyes closed. You didn't have much time to gather a strategy, your mind was still spinning at the sight of these nude half animal half human women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized from her expression that she wouldn't be patient for long, so you introduced yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....ah...I'm Brent.

I know you didn't expect to see me here....ah....\" You hesitated, unsure that you wanted to bare everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and what else?\" the kangaroo woman spoke up from behind you, her thick thighs moving dangerously close to your head. Immediately you realized your mistake. Your inability to leave was one of the last things they said, so by giving up that you heard anything at all, you made it clear you heard more than you were letting on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you continued. \"...and...and I know that you don't plan on letting me off this...well, whatever this is,\" you acknowledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit woman hops gleefully, making her breasts bounce and wobble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy Babs,\" the hippo chuckled, \"I don't think he's as excited as we are that he'll be sticking around,\" the hippo laughed. The rabbit frowned at this realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse was still much more serious. \"You are on an exploratory ship from the planet Jaha designed to cover any terrain. Hela,\" she said to the hippo, \"The mask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHela jumped to attention and pulled what looked like a gas mask out of her bag and quickly fastened it to your face. \"Breathe deep Brent. Trust me, you'll need this,\" she said soothingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout having much other option, you did as you were told. You felt a rush of adrenaline before your heartbeat quickly normalized and the mask was removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" the horse woman said. \"Now, \" she continued, stradeling the table you were still lying on, holding herself just inches above your body. \"Are there any other humans on this island?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard at the sight of her looming pussy above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N....no. I live here alone. I mean, I have a staff, but they won't be back until morning,\" you answered quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. That gives us all night,\" the horse woman responded. Turning to her companions, she smiled. \"You're all dismissed,\" she said. As the rest of the crew left the room, she looked down on you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Fiona. You'll hear me referred to as Captain. But you can call me mistress,\" she said with a smile before she lowered herself onto your face and slowly rocked her body side to side across your prone skin.  </span></div></div>",

Lying back down you also realized that your mouth felt like it was packed with cotton. Only after groaning again did you realize that you\u2019re hot, extremely hot. Cracking your eyes open, you found that you couldn\u2019t see much through billowing clouds. A brief moment of panic over a fire cooled off when you realized that it was steam not smoke drifting around you. Sitting up again, much more slowly this time, you were confused to see that you were in a room you didn\u2019t recognize; gleaming metal everywhere, including the walls and the low platform you\u2019re lying on. Several vents high on the walls were steadily pumping out the steam. Everything looked and felt damp from the moisture in the air and there was an acrid scent that clung to the back of your throat. The smell briefly stirred a memory of visiting your mother in the hospital. Pushing the memory aside with a shake of your head, you forced yourself to your feet, though with more than a few wobbly half-attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you did so, you noticed just how much of your pale flesh was exposed to the hot wet air, namely all of it. Years of yo-yo dieting left you on distinctly in the fat category with very large breasts sitting atop a weighty stomach that pooled against wide hips, and every inch of your body was completely uncovered. A sudden embarrassed flash made you try to retain some decency, but you could only be marginally successful at that, and it looked like you were completely alone anyways so you let your hands fall from your body. Thoughts of hidden cameras and whatnot briefly flitted through your mind, but you grudgingly shoved them aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExploring the room turned up little else; no way to stop up the vents, no obvious signs of cameras or anything, no windows, and only the hint of a door: a rectangular patch of the wall slightly sunken in compared to the rest. There didn\u2019t seem to be any way of opening the door either, no handle, knob, button, nor hole. Pounding on the door and shouting did nothing but bruise your hand and further aggravate your apparently sore throat. Returning to the \u201cbed\u201d platform on the floor, you sat down again, occasionally sweeping an arm through the steam to briefly dispel some of it from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do, you turned your focus to how you ended up\u2026wherever you were. Straining, you managed to remember you were walking home from work, taking a shortcut through the park with your apartment building just barely visible through the trees. Then came a bright light and a loud noise, and you could almost taste the fear you had at thinking you were about to be hit by a car jumping the curb or something. Then the next thing you remember was waking up here, no flashes of jumbled images, and no sensations of pain or anything. The fear from the possibility of a car hitting you made you shiver despite the heat, so you did your best to not dwell on that memory. Focusing outward, you found that the heat was uncomfortable but not as painful as it was when you first awoke, the real issue was the smell burning in your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, though you couldn\u2019t be sure how much with no sure way of telling time. You might have dozed several times, and you got up and paced around the room as another time wasting measure. Throughout it all you could feel the annoying aspect of how your long wavy hair clung to your head and body due to a combination of sweat and the airborne humidity. As you continued to sit and walk, you couldn\u2019t stop thinking back to that supposed car accident since there was little else to think about. You toyed with the idea that you were in an accident and now you were in a hospital, though it didn\u2019t look like any that you knew of. You also thought maybe you were laying in a coma or dreaming after being hit. The more you thought about it, the more you thought that the light hadn\u2019t been in the right spot for headlights, and the sound wasn\u2019t like the grumble of a motor or the screech of tires. Following those thoughts, you were left wondering just what had happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lost your train of thought as a loud hiss caused you to nearly jump out of your skin, as did the sudden cool breeze that sent the steam whirling about. The \u201cdoor\u201d had opened, seemingly of its own accord. You crouched back, fearful of what might lie behind, especially since it was much brighter out there than the room you were in, making everything beyond bleached out and hard to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell come on, we don\u2019t have all day. You\u2019re finished in there, so get out here,\u201d a voice suddenly called out in English. There was an unmistakable edge of annoyance to the voice, but there was also something odd about the accent, though you couldn\u2019t quite place it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, you moved a few steps closer to the door, and you could see a bit of the room behind, but not much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me turn on the extractor. We really have to get going now, so get moving,\u201d the voice called with even more annoyance easily evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to find out what this \u201cextractor\u201d was, you moved out into the other room. The clouds of steam didn\u2019t spread past the door and you shivered as soon as you stepped through, the chill quite evident in comparison to the \u201csauna\u201d before. The light was enough to blind you, making you screw your eyes shut against the glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s better. When you are finished making that ridiculous expression, please get into the pool,\u201d the annoyance was mostly gone, but the odd accent was still in full effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasing your eyes open, you had to blink a number of times before you could see anything. You started to ask what was going on, but the words froze in your throat as you saw who was speaking.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You gaped in surprise at seeing a panda standing there, but not down on all fours as she should have been, she was standing upright with a humanesque body and looking at you as if expecting something from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then only doubled up on the shock factor for you by saying, \u201cBy the divines, are you hard of hearing or something? Get in the pool.\u201d She emphasized the command by enunciating and pointing with each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA portion of your mind connected the dots and found that she was the one speaking to you when you were in the other room; she had the same tone of annoyance and the same odd accent. Most of your mind was still stuck on the idea of a two legged panda woman, something like that couldn\u2019t really exist\u2026could it? Unaware of your mental lockup, the panda groaned and shook her head, with a look on her face that practically screamed \u201cwhy do I have to deal with this?\u201d Taking two quick steps closer, she pushed you roughly in the shoulder. In your stunned state, you couldn\u2019t react in time so you ended up falling backwards into the pool that she kept telling you to get in. The water was cold, very cold after the steam bath, and more than enough to take your breath away as you tried to avoid drowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to the surface, sputtering and thrashing about, you were dimly aware of the panda commanding \u201cHold still, hold still!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s only after several more moments that you realized that she was <i>cleaning</i> you, or at least trying to. You somewhat simmered down, in more than a little disbelief at what was happening, though also in an attempt at not ticking her off, as she was obviously stronger than she appeared. Thinking back, you found that one of your first thoughts upon seeing this creature was \u201csoft\u201d and now getting so close to her, you found that your thought wasn\u2019t far off: soft fur over an even softer body. She was covered in silky smooth black and white fur over a body that was decidedly plump, but far below your own weight, but carried it very well with quite a bit of confidence. She had to in order to wear something that looked like a jeweled bikini with most of the bikini portion removed, there was so little fabric between the small gemstones, and there wasn\u2019t much coverage even counting the stones. You felt your face go red and tore your eyes away and only felt the blush deepen when you realized that you were still naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to get away from her busy hands and cover yourself up, but she merely huffed and pulled you back into place and resumed her task without much effort. Shivers were soon setting in, further draining your energy past what the cold dunk had done. This, combined with your diminished mental faculties, made it so that you gave up resisting for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you managed to find your tongue again. You managed to stammer out, \u201cWhere am I?\u201d between your chattering teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile busy with washing your hair, she responded as if it was plainly obvious, \u201cYou\u2019re in the capital city of the planet Jeskara.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit for your cold addled mind to catch up with what she just told you. \u201cWait, I\u2019m on another planet? I\u2019m not on Earth!?\u201d You started to pull away from her in shock again, but she once more repositioned you before dunking you to get the soap out of your hair. You surfaced, gasping for breath and blinking your eyes against the water steaming off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as if she was speaking to a slow child, \u201cYes, you\u2019re a long way from your birth world. Now please be quiet, we\u2019re already running far enough behind schedule, and your frivolous questions aren\u2019t helping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny further attempts at figuring out what was going on were met only with stony silence so you soon gave up. After a while longer, she directed you out of the pool and quickly dried you off. The panda then handed you a bundle that you soon realized was clothing, looking somewhat vaguely like a jumpsuit and offering quite a bit more coverage than what the other was wearing. She pantomimed putting the clothes on so \u2013still feeling more than a little embarrassed standing around naked \u2013 you started to slip it on. As the odd fabric slipped over your skin, you noticed how it seemed to instantly wick away the chill that still clung to you. You also noticed how the suit was shaped to accentuate your already eye-catching curves despite the extra coverage, almost as if to show you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to ask the panda about this, but she didn\u2019t say a word. She instead looked you over briefly with those oddly red tinted eyes, gave a quick nod, and spun on her heel. She marched over to another door than the one leading to the steam room, and it opened automatically at her presence. Standing at the edge she looked back at you and gave a hurried \u201cfollow\u201d gesture, before sashaying out. With seemingly your only hope for answers taking off, you hesitated for only a moment before following. As you passed through the door, you looked at the frame for just a split second before nearly getting caught as the door started to seal shut with you in the way. You managed to get through and stifled a grumble in your throat, thinking it best to not antagonize any more than you apparently already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour \u201cguide\u201d wordlessly led you through hallways obviously richly decorated. There was plenty of art around, or at least you thought it was art since you could only recognize a few of things displayed about. Along the way, the two of you passed other \u201cpeople\u201d heading about business of their own, though each of them were humanoid animals just like the panda woman; you even saw a massive turtle man stomping along, sending tremors through the ground with each step. The windows along some of the walls showed you an unmistakably alien world that still felt somewhat familiar: a reddish sun hanging in the sky with hovering vehicles both big and large, all above a city that stretched beyond the limits of what you could see. So absorbed you were in gawking at everything about you that you nearly bumped into the plush rump of the panda when she stopped before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another annoyed glance over her shoulder, she then turned forwards again. \u201cCould you please go in and say that the cleansing has been finished?\u201d she asked with much more respect towards what you could only think of as a futuristic knight, complete with sword hanging from his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard nodded his helmeted head before heading through a small door in the vast wall. A second \u201cknight\u201d remained standing before the wall, though this one was a falcon with an axe instead. You were wondering about where these two guards were standing, spread quite a ways from the door, till you realized that the door was set in a <i>much</i> larger door with a matching opposite, both towering far over you and looking like the entrance to a hanger or something. Only now did you realize how tall the hallways were that you had passed through before; <i>What needs halls so big?</i> your frightened mind managed to wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if to try to answer, the doors started to open. It was actually more ominous that they did so soundlessly, no tremendous clang or earsplitting creak, nothing. The guard that went in before darted out through the still widening opening, taking his place again. Without looking over her shoulder this time, the panda gestured for you to follow, before sweeping through the door and into the room beyond.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A massive hall lined with tall pillars dotted along its length with a skylight running the whole length and giving a grand view of the sky while also allowing in plenty of that red light, making everything look it\u2019s bathed in blood. It was more than enough to send a chill up your spin, and the twin rows of the guards standing beside the pillars didn\u2019t help matters much either. That panda didn\u2019t spare a glance for any of that, seemingly too used to being in here before. Instead she continued sweeping up the length of the chamber, leading you towards the far end. You, on the other hand, had your head on a swivel, looking back and forth, taking in as much as you could on the trip. The room was obviously made to hold a massive number of people, and it was just as obviously made to show off wealth even more so than the rest of the place that you had seen. The pillars were intricately carved, there\u2019s banners hanging from each of the pillars, plenty more of the \u201cart\u201d along the walls, and the floor was polished to such a sheen that it almost as if you were walking on a giant mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet again, you were so lost in ogling your surroundings that you didn\u2019t notice the panda coming to a stop, and this time you really did run into her. This knocked her forward a step, before she turned around and glared with a growl in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud throat clearing caused the panda to freeze, before a new voice called out, \u201cSarah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panda spun around quickly, but you managed to see a look of utter embarrassment tinged with fear. \u201cApologies, my lady, it won\u2019t happen again. And as you requested, the newcomer has undergone cleansing.\u201d She bowed low, her long hair falling about her face like a curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou next turned your eyes to the one she was speaking to, and felt your mouth drop in shock. Several short steps combined to form a dais, and atop the platform was an enormous dragoness. She looked to be about eight feet tall, maybe a bit more, though it was hard to be sure since she was seated on a veritable pile of cushions. Being nearly as wide as she was tall, she formed a great blubbery mountain overlooking the room. She was \u201cclothed\u201d much like the panda, but with far more ornamentation, though her size also meant that far more of her body was left exposed. Atop her head was a jeweled circlet, though it was almost entirely hidden among the curls of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlunging her hand into a bowl beside her, she brought out several things that looked a bit like apple sized blueberries and briefly played with them between her fingers. You weren\u2019t even sure what they were, but the look of them was enough to cause your stomach to let out a small hungry grumble. She then deftly tossed them into the air and caught each of them in her razor lined maw. It was slightly unnerving how she performed this little show without taking her violet eyes off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are Vanessa Lawson, yes?\u201d the dragoness said after staring at you for a rather uncomfortable stretch of time. Her voice had a similar accent to the panda, but was much more melodious in tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to stammer out confirmation, still a bit stunned from everything that had happened recently. The dragoness gave a small hum before raising one of her massive flabby arms. Passing a hand over a jeweled bracelet encircling her vast wrist, a floating rectangle appeared before her, looking every bit like a computer screen without the computer or the screen. The dragoness continued to ask questions of you \u2013 confirming that your father died years ago and your mother much more recently, that you had no siblings or any other close relatives, that you had no significant other, and so on \u2013 confirming that you were indeed the correct Vanessa Lawson. Partway through the questioning, you realized that she must have been using your social media profiles and internet activities to check if it was you. You managed to find a break to ask about this, and the dragoness said that it was true, before muttering about how archaic human information systems where. Throughout everything, the panda \u2013 Sarah apparently \u2013 remained before you, standing still like a statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the interrogation, the dragoness smiled wide into her flabby cheeks as the floating screen vanished. \u201cYou did well, Sarah. She is indeed the one that I was seeking.\u201d The panda responded to this praise by bowing low again and giving numerous thanks to the massive dragoness, with a wide smile of her own across her face, as well as an expression that was unmistakably relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing your throat, you then tried to keep your voice steady and were even mostly successful, much to your own surprise. \u201cMay I ask why you have been \u2018seeking\u2019 me in particular?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled again, and there was something about that smile that sent another chill through your spine. \u201cYes, you may, and the answer is\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

What do you mean by that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness furrowed her eyebrows, and glanced at Sarah before asking her \u201cThe humans do understand property, yes?\u201d The panda nodded before the dragoness turned back to you, \u201cI mean exactly that: you\u2019re my property, I own you.\u201d You couldn\u2019t stop yourself, a nervous laugh escaped before you could stop it. \u201cI\u2019m not aware that I said something funny. Under our laws, we can take possession of someone who does not belong to someone else, whether through blood or marriage. I have had agents observing you for a time and was very pleased to find that you fit the qualifications.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear continued to build in you as she spoke, there was no sign of this being a mean-spirited joke or anything, so it was sounding like she really did mean that you were supposed to be her property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear made you speak up without thinking first, \u201cBut\u2026you\u2026can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m\u2026I\u2026I have a life. You can\u2019t\u2026just\u2026enslave me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rounded on you, teeth bared, the muscles in her neck tensed, and eyebrows lowered. She then barked out, \u201cHow <i>dare</i> you! You presume to tell the queen what she can and cannot do in her own throne room!? She is the Mother of Nations, the Matriarch of the infinite ocean, she oversees nearly the entire galaxy, and she has more than the right to do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panda raised her hand as if to slap you but stopped instantly at the sound of the dragoness calling her name. She was then commanded to turn around and promptly did so, dropping her hand to her side again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness tsked and shook her head. \u201cSarah, that outburst was uncalled for. We do have to give my newest acquisition <i>some</i> leeway; she is unaccustomed to how things are done beyond her small backwater planet.\u201d Sarah hung her head in shame, begging forgiveness. \u201cI will have to discipline you for this, you understand, yes?\u201d The panda only nodded her head in agreement. \u201cFirst, you will not be involved in my bathing till I say so again.\u201d Sarah gulped loudly enough that you could hear it standing a few steps away. She also looked like she wanted to say something but buried it away. \u201cSecond, you will now be assigned to Vanessa. You will serve her for now, but you will also teach her of our ways. I expect you do well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she said that final line made you think that despite what this \u201cqueen\u201d said it was less an expectation and more of an absolute command. The panda seemed as if she would like to protest but instead proceeded to say that she would unerringly fulfill the dragoness\u2019 wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness turned back to you. \u201cAnd as for you\u2026Why do you wish to return to your old life? Didn\u2019t we just confirm that your life on Earth was insignificant and stagnant?\u201d You didn\u2019t say anything in response, but you did lower your eyes to avoid her haunting gaze hoping to avoid admitting that it was true. She continued on without your answer though, \u201cBut here you can see and do things that other humans could never experience. In addition, you are not being \u2018enslaved\u2019. Yes, you will be required to do as I ask, but you will also have more freedom than most humans even have on your homeworld, as well as live a comfortable life that many would yearn for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did sound wonderful: a brand new start away from everything that you had known. And from the looks of things you had seen so far your life would indeed be comfortable beyond anything you had on Earth. And as for the part about having to do as she asked, that didn\u2019t seem so different from having to do as your previous boss had told you to, except this dragoness seemed much more pleasant than that mean old hag. Now convinced, you nodded and agreed, and the dragoness \u2013 <i>my queen now</i> you mused \u2013 smiled wide before dismissing you and Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you left the throne room, a worrying through wormed into your head: it probably hadn\u2019t mattered that you had agreed to it, you were already her property either way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The panda led you through the meandering halls again, till eventually you reached a set of doors that opened into where you would be living. You were expecting a cramped little room with barely enough space for you to move about in, certainly not the sprawling suite that looked more like a luxury apartment. Sarah was still apparently displeased with you because her exceedingly brief tour was icy at best, before she quickly left you alone saying she would return the next morning. You proceeded to explore a bit: first checking out the bedroom and walk-in closet \u2013 containing clothes somewhat like what you used to wear on earth all the way up to skimpy little things like Sarah and the queen wore and beyond. You found that there was a small but fully functional kitchenette included, and figured that anything more might be provided by a larger kitchen elsewhere in the massive palace. The thought of food made your belly grumble, but you held off for the moment wanting to finish exploring your new home. The bathroom was lavish and fully furnished, even if you couldn\u2019t recognize all of the pieces in there. At the center was a sitting room looking out through floor to ceiling and wall to wall windows at a section of forest that almost looked like a park. A set of doors would admit you outside, but the sun was dipping low by now, so you turned away from the tranquil little scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the kitchenette, you found some food that was closer to what you had on earth and went with that over the more alien looking cuisine for now. Soon enough, you had a hot sandwich and a side of something that closely resembled potato chips along with a glass of what appeared to be milk of some sort. Not exactly high class fare, but it looked filling enough. The first bite blew your taste buds, flavors far beyond what you were expecting, practically making your tongue sing. Before you realized it, you had scarfed every last crumb down. You briefly thought about getting something else to eat, just to see if tasted just as wonderful, but decided against it. Instead, you wondered through to the bed, stripped off your outfit and slipped under the covers. The bed was much nicer than the lumpy bed you had before; it was so nice that you easily drifted off to sleep despite the oddity of being on a distant world surrounded by actual aliens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2013+\u2013+\u2013+\u2013</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took time but you slowly started to get used to things with the Istu \u2013 what these aliens called themselves. Days blurred into weeks and beyond as you learned whatever you were taught, your body adjusting to the somewhat longer days and lighter gravity that Jeskara experienced. You learned about the vast interstellar civilization the Istu had built and some of the notable planets that they had developed including Jeskara, as well as more personal matters like how you should react and respond to the various people you might encounter in your new life, in addition to how to work the more basic forms of technology that were part of most Istu lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the second day, you were concerned that Sarah would be icy or distant as she had been after the trouble in the throne room. Your worries proved unfounded when she came to you that morning as she had said: she was instead much more vibrant and cheerful towards you. You didn\u2019t ask her about the change in personality towards you as you didn\u2019t want to chance slipping back to how she had been the night before. The panda was a capable teacher, answering your questions and assisting you whenever needed. She also seemed to bear no ill will about now serving you, fulfilling your wishes with a smile. You kept your requests simple though \u2013 due to the simple matter of not wanting to antagonize her \u2013 mostly consisting of wanting food or new entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food was just as wonderful, if not more so, than that first bit you had on the earliest night here. You started getting a bit more adventurous after playing it safe for the first week or so, adding in dishes and fare more common to Istu plates. The amazing tastes \u2013 as well as the novelty of so much new food \u2013 meant that you regularly ate more than what you really needed. This excess, combined with how rich the foods were, led to a rather inevitable result: you started gaining weight. It started out relatively slow, but quickly ramped up till you were gaining at least several pounds each day. You were dumbfounded at this outcome, and tried to restrain yourself. It worked, but only partially; you were still gaining weight but now at a somewhat slower place. You started making regular jaunts into the small patch of forest outside your rooms, jogging along the winding path through the trees and flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first day you found out that the forest was actually something like a greenhouse: a sealed section containing plants from Earth. \u201cSomething to help you settle in,\u201d Sarah called it. You had no idea how they made it or the pleasant breeze that made the leaves move pleasantly throughout the enclosure. The material making up the transparent walls even filtered the sunlight somehow to make it look more like the earth\u2019s sun, allowing you to almost believe that you had never left your homeworld though the illusion quickly broke down as you could see the alien city beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exercise further helped to stabilize your weight, but not completely, your body still slowly but surely packing on further fat to your already rounded frame. Loose clothing eventually turned tight, while already close-fitting garments grew increasingly ill fitting and overtaxed. Around the time that you had to ask for a third upsize for your outfits, you started getting the sensation that Sarah was looking you over more than usual. She never did it when you were looking her direction, but you could sporadically feel her eyes tracing your fleshy body whenever your back was turned. All of your attempts to ask her about this suspicion never left your throat, out of a desire not to stir things up anymore than you already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour choice of clothing started to shift during this time, changing from nearly full body coverings to those that showed a bit of your pale skin. You didn\u2019t feel confident enough to get into the scandalously revealing clothing yet, but you started to feel a bit better about showing off your body as well. You got the feeling that Sarah\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d glances were going on a bit longer and probing deeper as you started down this path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Evangeline, as you were told her name eventually, took a decidedly hands-off approach with you. She was often busy with matters of state, and even when she wasn\u2019t she already had a retinue of other servants for her needs. It seemed like she had you now, and that was mostly enough for her. She did occasionally call on you though, mostly to serve as the help for a feast or something. Each time you met someone new, you drew a number of shocked expressions and double takes, which probably wasn\u2019t hard to understand, since most Istu had only heard of humans, never seeing one before especially in the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lack of being called on meant that you had a lot of free time, which you mostly spent entertaining yourself and exploring the palace and city beyond. The wider population slowly grew used to your presence as you grew used to them. You still felt like an outsider though, only loosening up when you were with Sarah. The panda seemed to like your jokes almost as much as you liked telling them, though that was mostly just to hear her laugh. Three months after you had been taken away from your old life, the routine was finally broken.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Standing before you was a cow, but she was up on two legs with an obviously annoyed look on her face. You were instantly stunned by her appearance, though a portion of that was due to seeing an upright humanoid cow, more than a little of your shock had to do with everything else. She was fat, obviously so and just as obviously confident considering that she was wearing what you could only think of as a tiny bikini that left little to the imagination. Black and white fur covered her body, looking silky soft and shiny. A long braid of jet black fell from down her back to her waist, though a few loose locks hung around the curling horns and long ears that stuck out from her head. Her face had a stern expression, but was alluring as well with the full lips and deep green eyes. You couldn\u2019t help but be drawn to her body though; her breasts were even larger than your own, and there were four of them pushing out far from her body. Similarly, her hips and thighs were wide and plush, wrapping about into a rump that looked like it would make any seat comfortable. Her stomach was not spared the extra weight either, but compared to the size of her assets above and below it was downright tiny giving her an excessively exaggerated hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like you had been staring for an eternity, but it must have only been a moment. The cow gave a little growl in the back of her throat before taking two quick steps closer to you \u2013 causing her flesh to wiggle with each one \u2013 before planting her hand in your shoulder and shoving. You let out with a cry that was cut off as you plunged into water, most likely the pool that you had been told to get into. The water was cold, though that may have been just due to how warm you were from the steam room. It was still more than enough to set your teeth chattering and cause you to break out in goose pimples as you came back to the surface. The woman then squatted down beside the tub and pulled you closer. Without a word, she then set to cleaning you using a gel, the smell of which reminded you of the smell you had in the steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried numerous times to resist and get away, but the cow was easily able to put a stop to any attempt. There was a layer of muscle buried beneath her fat flesh, and her strength was obviously beyond what that layer might suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had settled down, you became aware that the cow was muttering to herself, murmuring things like \u201cI\u2019m likely going to get punished for taking so long,\u201d and \u201cI hope this is appreciated enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized her voice; it was the one that called to you in the steam room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you managed to find your own tongue and get it under control. Between your chattering teeth you asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow stopped, her face going a bit more lax as she leaned back and sighed. \u201cSorry, this is probably all more than a little odd to you.\u201d You nodded, doing your best not to roll your eyes at the obviousness of that. \u201cYou just went through a deep decontamination cycle. It\u2019s unlikely that you have anything that would be a probably, especially after the first cleansing on the ship when you were picked up\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, \u2018ship\u2019, \u2018picked up\u2019? Was that the light and sound in the park\u2026whenever that was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the cow\u2019s turn to nod now, \u201cMost likely. I heard there had to be a compromise between stealth and speed. Now can I please finish up, we\u2019re already late enough as it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded meekly, letting her continue, not wanting to antagonize her any further. All of your attempts to get any more information about the situation were met with stony silence or variations of saying that would be revealed soon enough. Only after giving up on that clearly fruitless effort did you realize that you were still naked. You tried to pull away again and cover up, but the cow effortlessly brought you back into position in order to finish up. After using the gel in your hair, she scooped water over your head and rinsed it out, though the sudden chilly water left you sputtering for more than a short time. The cow then directed you out of the tub and helped you dry off before handing you a bundle of cloth. As you let it hang free you saw that it was clothing, though only just barely. To your eyes it was a sleeveless bodysuit and made of some smooth almost completely sheer material except for a few small more opaque patches placed to preserve some modesty. It was obviously made to show off nearly as much of your body as it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoicing your reluctance to wear the \u201coutfit\u201d was met with a shrug by the cow, \u201cThat is what I was told for you to wear. If you don\u2019t want to wear it, you can go as you are now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with that alternative, you opted to wear the bodysuit. The suit easily stretched \u2013 handy considering how small it had seemed in your hands \u2013 and molded to your frame. The neckline plunged to expose much of your breasts, while the back rode up at the bottom to show off your rounded cheeks. You grimaced as you realized just how little of your body was actually hidden by the clothing; it almost felt like you were on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow looked you over before giving a brief nod of approval, though she did fuss with your hair a bit, arranging the crimson waves a bit better. Once satisfied, she took your hand and nearly dragged you along, leaving the sparse room behind and taking you out into the hallway beyond. After the Spartan d\u00e9cor of the rooms you left behind, you found the hallway to be still a bit plain but much more inviting. You finally got a view of the outside as the cow led you past a window, and what you saw outside stopped you in your tracks.</span></div></div>",

It was quite an idyllic view, but you couldn\u2019t quite figure out where on Earth you were. You quickly noticed some signs that you likely weren\u2019t on Earth though. For one thing, the water looked almost golden with purplish foam atop the waves and where they hit the sand. The sand itself wasn\u2019t right either, being a dark blue rather than any of the usual colors of sand. Similarly unusual were the trees, they looked a bit like palm trees, but you had never heard of a tree having gray leaves like that or trees having what looked like a bush sprouting about halfway down the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not on Earth any more, am I?\u201d you asked more than a little numb with the realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you are not,\u201d the cow responded plainly and letting that hang in the air<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grabbed your arm and pulled you along again without another word, obviously in a rush to get wherever the two of you were supposed to go. Along the way, you heard snippets of conversations behind closed doors or down other hallways, but couldn\u2019t hear enough to make sense of whatever was being said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, the cow brought you through another door, this time leading outside. You found yourself on a patio overlooking the beach just a short distance beyond. The furniture dotted around was recognizable if not quite totally familiar. The cow stopped only briefly, glancing about before pulling you towards one of the seats closest to the sand. A large umbrella \u2013 made to let some but not all of the sun\u2019s light through \u2013 shaded the seat. The seat was large enough that you could tell that someone was sitting in it, but not who or what they were. A few paces from the seat, the cow motioned for you to stay there before taking the last couple of steps on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have brought the human as you requested,\u201d she said respectfully, bowing so low that her breasts nearly slipped from the cups of her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a murmur of confirmation before the chair squeaked and the occupant stood up, granting you the first view of them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thought you had as the dragoness stepped out around her seat and closer to you was <i>Wow, she\u2019s tall</i>. Despite your own above average height, the cow stood about half a foot taller than you\u2014not counting her horns though, and the dragoness was even taller still, nearly a foot to a foot and a half beyond the cow. This radical difference in height meant that you had to crane your neck up to look her in the eye, and looking straight ahead put your eyes pointing nearly straight at her breasts. And what a pair of breasts they were, slightly smaller than the cow\u2019s, putting them still larger than your own, they were also didn\u2019t sag under their weight nearly as much as it looked like they should. Down below, her hips and thighs were wide and rounded, cascading down into shapely and long legs. Capping off this striking woman was a beautiful face surrounded with waves of deep blue almost black hair, except for the sky blue that graced a single forelock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were torn between shock and lust at how the dragoness was covering her body, which is to say not very much at all. Her torso was clad in what looked like a loose and flowing robe in shape, but was made entirely from the material which made up the majority of your bodysuit. This design meant that it was nearly entirely transparent, leaving her pert breasts entirely visible through the \u201ccovering\u201d. The \u201crobe\u201d fell to roughly her waist, where a tiny thong barely concealed anything there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were quickly overcome with thoughts of being entangled with this divine creature. The large leathery wings wrapped around you, holding you tight against the silky white scales running up her belly, while the short claws on her fingers lightly scratched across your pale skin. Your hands were alternately buried in the plush mounds of her breasts, running southward to grope the onyx scales that covered her butt and the rest of her body, or slipping around to the front to tease her wet slit. Lips pressed against lips as tongues entwined as you both crashed over the precipice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head sharply to clear away the carnal images, though they still left you breathing heavily as a blush spread up across your neck and cheeks. As you returned to the real world, you slowly became aware that the dragoness had been examining you nearly as much as you had been her. Her lapis hued eyes were roaming the myriad curves of your body, lingering a fair bit more around your own breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking several times, the dragoness seemed to recover quicker than you had before speaking in a sensual voice that nearly drove you to distraction again. \u201cI apologize for the suddenness of everything, Ms Lawson. I\u2019m sure that you have many questions. Please, take a seat,\u201d sweeping an arm out to indicate a pair of seats sitting a short distance away. You wondered about her knowing your name, but didn\u2019t give voice to this question yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasing down onto one seat, the dragoness took the other, while the cow remained standing just behind the dragoness\u2019 seat. The dragoness then started explaining things; starting with how you were taken from Earth and brought many light years across the galaxy to here, the planet Trilia. She then introduced herself as Sarah Levav and the cow as Anya Nere, who acted as Sarah\u2019s assistant and servant; Anya bowed her head as she was introduced. Sarah continued with a few points of their species, the Chalh, though the major point was that despite the obvious differences, both Sarah and Anya were really the same species. You only managed to pay half attention to what she was saying though, your mind constantly slipping off focus at being so close to the dragoness; even her scent was intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually your mind was able to engage just enough that you came to a realization about something she hadn\u2019t mentioned and that you just had to ask about. \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d you blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah inhaled sharply and quickly blinked as your question hung in the air, then looked back at Anya. After a moment, the dragoness returned her gaze to you before saying, \u201cYes\u2026about that\u2026\u201d Her voice had taken on an odd tone, you weren\u2019t sure if it was anticipation, reluctance, or something else entirely. Your stomach cramped and felt like a pound of ice had formed within, fear beginning to rise at what was happening.</span></div></div>",

Your parents have gone out to run some errands and left you alone to watch the farm. You sit in the living room of the farm house, watching television, when you hear a loud squawking from outside. You sigh in annoyance and grab the shotgun above the fireplace. Those damn coyotes were after the chickens again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run outside, weapon at the ready. You brought a flashlight, and shine it at the chicken pen, and see it was it fact not a coyote, but a fox that was after your chickens. You chase after the fox into the cornfield and loose track of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring it won't be back after the scare you gave it, you lower your gun and start to head back to the house. Suddenly, you feel a sort of electric shock all throughout your body and you collapse to the ground, before everything goes dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awaken, you see you are in large bubble, in the center of what looked to be some sort of lab. But the even stranger part, was that the creatures outside your bubble were some sort of humanoid animals, like wolves, cats and even a fox, all dressed is silver jumpsuits with strange symbols on them. The fox was watching you from the other side of the bubble. You could tell by its voluptuous figure it must have been female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cat came up to the fox and said something you couldn't hear, before the vixen nodded and actually stepped through the bubble's surface and was now inside it with you.

She then reached out and stuck a small object in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she was speaking English. \"Can you understand me?\" She said \"What's going on?\" You say \"Who are you?\" \"I am Dr. Fyla.\" Said the fox \"I was the one you chased through that field on Earth.\" \"How do you speak my language?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am actually not.

You see, our world is being ravaged by a strange and potentially disastrous plight. A mysterious sterility plague has spread across our planet, rendering all it infects unable to reproduce. For some yet unknown reason, it only seems to affect males.

I know we basically kidnapped you, if you want to look at it that way, but please, we need to do this for the survival of our race. If we don't, it would only be a matter of time before our whole species would go extinct. Won't you please help us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she put it that way, how could you refuse? She leads you by the hand out of the bubble, and the rest of the crew begin to examine you. \"Before we reach out planet, we must first make sure you are a physically healthy specimen fit for breeding. No diseases or potential genetic deformities, that sort of thing.\" Dr. Fyla explained.

She would often be found passed out drunk on the front porch.  You were hoping for something to change in your life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were walking through the woods near your house late one evening.  You were wishing something would change in your life.  You'd been walking for several hours when suddenly, </span></div></div>",

At first you don't see anything but suddenly a pair of eyes begin shining in the night up in one of the trees. You stare for a second, frozen in place.  The eyes narrow and you find the strength in your legs. You take off running, not looking back. As you run you can swear you see another pair of eyes in a bush. In that second you were distracted you run into something large and furry. You start to fall down but someone grabs you. It turns out that someone is what you ran into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at who grabbed you and can't believe it. Standing there is a tall anthropomorphic tiger woman. She's about ten feet tall, with you coming up to her stomach. She's got a voluptuous body with enormous breasts and she's wearing what looks like a blue jumpsuit. Keeping her grip on you she spins you around and you see a set of shining eyes in the night. That must be what you saw in the bush. As it gets closer you see that its an anthropomorphic cougar woman. She's just as tall as the tiger with a similar body. Your body tenses up but then you see her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sure can run huh?\" the cougar says with a smirk. She bends down to get a look at you and scratches under your chin. \"Not bad. My name is Rita by the way.\" You don't make a sound as Rita looks up at the tiger. \"Good job grabbing him Riley.\" she says. You stare up to see the tiger smiling down at you. Suddenly the first set of eyes you saw comes into view. It turns out to be a black panther woman. She's shorter than the others at about eight feet. \"Hey Tammy.\" Rita says. The panther, or Tammy, walks up and looks at you. \"I see you caught us a....\"</span></div></div>",

Rita leans in close and gives you a smirk. \"So you can talk huh?\" she asks while rubbing your cheek. You suddenly feel yourself being fondled and notice that the big paws holding onto you are moving up and down your body. Looking up you see Riley blushing under her fur. \"Geez, wait a little longer Riley.\" Tammy says jokingly. \"Sorry...\" the huge tiger says quietly. Rita stands up straight and starts walking away. \"Alright, let's get out of here. We'll explain everything on the ship.\" she says. Riley slings you over her shoulder and the three of them walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Riley stops walking you look up to see an honest to God spaceship. When the door opens the three women enter with you in tow. You see that you're in what looks like the control room. All of them sit down and buckle their seatbelts. Riley does so with you still in her lap, securing you against her large soft body. Rita starts managing the controls while Tammy chuckles at Riley's obvious enjoyment at having you close to her. You feel the ship rumble and then lift off of the ground. There's a feeling of pressure for a minute and then its gone. The girls all unfasten their seatbelts and Rita turns to you. \"I guess I should explain.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, we're not from your planet.\" Rita says. \"We actually live on this ship and travel all over the universe.\" Tammy turns to you as well.  \"It was great when we formed the travel group but eventually we realized we were...bored.\" she says. \"So we decided to find a communal boyfriend to have some fun with.\" Tammy says. Riley hugs you tighter and smiles. \"Yes...\" she says. \"We decided to pick you after watching you for a while. It looks like we won't cause a fuss by taking you and you seem easy to control.\" Rita finishes. So in a nutshell, you're now the shared boyfriend of some space colony.

Before you can answer she grabs you by the arm and hauls you off. Riley watches you go disappointed while Rita rolls her eyes with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou marvel at the size of the ship's interior as the panthress drags you around. \"Pretty impressive huh?\" she asks. It sure is. This place is pretty much like a hotel. So far she's showed you a library, a gym, and lots of other rooms. \"We have plenty of ways to pass the time for long trips.\" Tammy says. \"The trip we're on now will take at least several days.\".  Wow, you're really headed far from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually during your tour Tammy leads you to the bedrooms. The hallway here is lined with rooms. \"We have a lot just in case we have a big group on board.\" Tammy explains. She opens one of the doors and leads you inside. \"You'll be staying here.\" she says. You look around and see how nice it is. \"You get the place to yourself for now. I'd love to share a room with you, but Rita says we should let you take everything in first.\" She looks a little annoyed at this. \"Unless you want to get a little closer  right now?\" she asks.

You look up to find Riley standing behind you, looking down. \"Riley, I don't think...\" you start, but then her grip on your shoulders tightens. She begins to guide you toward the tub, a gleam in her eye. She can feel you resisting a little and stops at the edge. Thinking she's letting you go you sigh, but instead she grabs your shirt. In a flash she tears it off, along with your pants and shoes, until you're in your boxers. Then she lifts you up and gently tosses you into the chocolate tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the chocolate and sink down into the tub. Looking back you see Riley stepping into the tub as well. She makes her way over to you as you sit down near the edge. The tigress slides up next to you and sighs contentedly. It feels weird sitting in chocolate. Its warm and thick, a new experience for you. You've only been in tubs of, well, water. Raising a hand to you're face you wipe the chocolate ooze off of you. Suddenly Riley's mouth closes on your fingers, slurping the chocolate off. You're caught off guard as she then begins licking it off your face. The two of you relax here for a while, Riley licking you every now and then.  You didn't know why, but you were kind of starting to enjoy being licked by the female tiger.

She pauses for a second, looking into your eyes, before pulling you in for a kiss. This shocks you, but you know its pointless to resist. Her larger tongue dominates yours and completely explores your mouth. She keeps it going for a while before breaking the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley starts lapping up the chocolate on your chest and you feel her getting lower. Soon her grip on your shoulders lets up and she grabs your hips instead. Before you can say anything her head disappears under the chocolate. You then feel it, her tongue on your lower half. You try to push her off but she holds you firmly. Her large rear is sticking up in the air, tail swishing about. Before long you're lying in pleasure. When its over she rises from the chocolate and gives you a hug, cuddling you to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, that was nice.\" you say. Riley starts purring and holds you tighter. \"Yeah.\" she agrees. This is pretty nice. You could probably get used to it.

You wonder what they'll be like, and after a while you get Riley's attention.  \"Something bothering you?\" she asked.  \"I'm just trying to get used to how things are now.\" you replied.

Chocolate again?\" Rita asks Riley. The tigress clutches you to herself and shrugs. With a sigh Rita begins undressing. \"Well we might as well have some fun.\" she says. Tammy starts disrobing as well. \"I can't pass up some time with Kyle.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they're naked the two women step into the tub.

You're now right in the middle of the three lusty cats, who each look ready for action. Riley squeezes your ass from behind and begins licking your back. You shiver as her tongue runs its length. Rita grips your shoulders and goes to work on your face, kissing you as she goes. Finally, Tammy is lapping away at your chest and stomach, while her paw is jerking you off below the chocolate. The combination of all this pleasure is too much and you climax right there. Between the three of them you're kind of worn out and fall forward  little.

You say you have family, but you only have you're mother and she isn't exactly the brightest star in your sky, and you've no ideas where your father is do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her in disbelief, how could she know that? How long had they been watching you? \"How long ha-\" You were abruptly silenced as Riley covered your mouth with her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't finished\" Rita replied as she paced around a bit, \"You also lack any real friends, you have a few acquaintances... But that's all they are. They don't check up on you or think about you. They never call out of concern or regard for you, it's strictly business.\" You didn't want to admit it but she was right, there was virtually nobody who cared about you, if you dissappeared they would ask questions, sure, but you sincerely doubt that they'd start a manhunt just to make sure you were ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if we did leave you here,\" Riley broke in, \"The government will be here within the hour. You're within one of your miles of our ship. They'll know where you've been and want to lock you up and interrogate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was also true, chances are that someone or something somewhere has a record or picture of you being so close to their landing site. You might as well be E.T. At this point, because the Feds would be on you like white on rice. Besides, this could be the change you were looking for, and even if it wasn't, they said themselves that they weren't going to let you go, and you doubt you could escape them even if you really and/or still wanted to. At length you sigh and decide you should just go willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You win, I'll come with you,\" you sigh with a shrug. The three cats looked at each other gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We promise we'll take really good care of you!\" Rita exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't regret this! You'll have tons of fun!\" Riley beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for coming willingly and giving us a chance\" Tammy smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talk as if you were actually given a choice. Guess they really appreciated the fact that you wanted to go versus them forcing you. Before you could give anymore thought to what was happening, Riley slung you over her shoulder and all three furries began making their way through the woods, presumably too their ship. You get a brief glimpse of an entryway before your world blurs as you're handed off to one of the other two girls. When everything comes back into focus you find yourself sitting in Tammy's lap at some sort of control station. Before you can move or say anything, she fastens a seat belt over both of you, in effect strapping you to her own body. It was rather comfortable for the most part, but kind of weird. You glance up at her questioning lay as she  returns your glance with an apologetic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, we're in a hurry and we don't really have any chairs that you'll fit in yet,\" She explains, \"So for now, when we leave and land on different planets, you'll have to sit with one of us.\" She said she was sorry but her face didn't really match her words, her expression looked more like guilty pleasure to you. But you let it pass and watch as she reaches around you to operate the controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three felines start shouting technological space and code phrases to each other, you assume it's a preflight check. Before long though it gets quiet and the ship start to shudder and the sound of rocket engines fills the air and resonates through your bones. You look up and find an oval shaped window just above the work station, you watch as the faint outline of trees surrounding the ship fall away from the window. You feel your body being pressed into Tammy's although she doesn't seem to mind, you feel slightly uncomfortable being so close to someone you just me, especially when they're not even human!  Eventually, the night sky in the window is replaced with a black star filled void, and the rattling ceases. You notice your body no longer feels so compressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how'd we do? Did we make a clean getaway?\" Rita asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Several government vehicles are currently surrounding the area we launched from, and there's no doubt that they saw us leave.\" Tammy reported, \"Our stealth technology is advanced, but they found us because they know how to detect us now. We may not ever be able to go back without risk of detection upon entering the earths gravitational field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess it doesn't matter, we won't be coming back here anyway\" Rita sighed, \"What about the ship?

You were coming to grips with the fact that you were never going to see Earth ever again. Tammy waved a paw in front of your face to get your attention, when you seemed to come back to life she unbuckled you and slid you off of her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" She asked as she tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm just thinking... I'm never going to get to go back ever again...\" You replied. Just then she slowly stood up, forcing you to slide off of her lap and stand on your own two feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's a lot to take in...\" Tammy admitted. Before she could say anymore Riley walked over with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take your mind off of it, how about I take you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She walks you down a hallway and steers you toward a blank looking door which slides to the side, leaving an empty doorway for you to enter. The room is pretty basic, all of the walls look like they're made of titanium. There's a bed that is big enough for one of your 'captors' in the center of the room with covers and a pillow. There's also a sitting area and a desk that's built into the wall and looks as if it's made of the same materials as the wall as well. You find that there's also a small bathroom in your room, not unlike what you'd find in an airplane on earth but there's a little more space in it. You also find a couple of dressers integrated into the wall and a mirror hanging beside your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know it's pretty basic,\" Riley sighs, \"But it does the job right?

Once close enough she actually grips you in a bear hug and pins you against her body before spinning around and leaping backwards onto the bed. As she flops down on the bed she releases a fit of laughter, causing you to do the same. You both lay there for a moment laughing about the silly randomness of the situation. After your laughter dies down Riley flips you over so that you are looking at her face, \"Feeling better yet?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nod your head happily, \"I am... thanks Riley, I really needed that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anytime,\" Riley replied before giving you a toothy grin and a playfully poking your nose with one of her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just then there was a knock at the door, shortly after which the door slid open and Tammy walked in, \"So how's our little- Oh...

Deep down she actually wanted to spend more time with you, maybe even tease you a bit... but she had things to do before the arrival at the station and even if she didn't, Riley would make it very difficult for her to get away with too much before cutting her fun short.... she'd just wait for another opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After Tammy leaves, you are left feeling thoroughly confused about what's happening. \"Riley?\" You ask prompting the tiger to turn and look down at you with a curious expression. \"What exactly is going on?

How cheap are they buying the goods to turn a profit like that?! Looking up at Riley you decide to ask her the question that's on you're mind, though you suspect she already knows what you're going to ask judging by the amused smile on her lips, \"So... how cheap do you actually buy the goods that you sell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Usually for about fifteen to twenty five percent or the normal price,\" She replies. And that answers your question. \"It's like I said, the stuff we buy is significantly reduced in price be it for a damaged unit in the shipment, unwanted cargo or outdated parts. You'd be surprised at the shipments that commercial companies turn down or refuse because of minor details. For example, if a company receives a shipment of thrusters and one is damaged in transit, then they refuse the entire shipment. The seller then needs to find a way to get rid of the product without it being a total loss.

You flop down on your bed and think about your new life. It doesn't seem like it'll be that bad. In fact, it might even be kinda fun. You imagine the things you'll see and the thing you'll learn. \"Definitely beats watching documentaries and looking through a telescope,\" You chuckle to yourself. You start to doze off after a little while but your are jolted awake when the entire ship experiences somewhat of an earthquake. You fall off your bed and onto the metal ground with a grunt of pain.

You need to be with one of us at all times.\" Okay that's reasonable, I mean.... If you were in another country with a tour guide you wouldn't want to stray to far from the group right? \"Rule number two,\" Rita continued holding up two digits for emphasis, \"Don't take anything from anyone without our consent, I think that's pretty self explanatory.\" You nod, there's literally a whole list of reasons for that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Three,\" Tammy interjected, \"Don't ever leave the ship without one of us... period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rita nodded, \"That goes more with number one though.

The door opens with a hiss as steam flows from around the doorway. The door slides up and locks itself open, allowing the four of you to exit the ship. Tammy remains behind you while Rita and Riley stay in front. You're utterly amazed by everything you see around you. Some aliens are in metallic space suits and others are in regular clothes that you'd find people wearing at the mall. Most of the alien furries you see are recognizeable, but some aren't you see one that looks like a cross between a wolf and a shark. Another one is some sort of squirrel tiger and there's a few more you can't even identify. You suddenly feel a paw on the side of your arm tugging you in another direction. You look up to find that your group had actually made a slight turn and had you kept going you might've strayed away from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What did we just tell you about wandering off?\" Tammy asked as she removed her paw from your arm.

But, its important that you pay attention to where we are and where you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I will,\" You mutter. She's talking to you sternly, but you can tell by the hint of mirth in her voice and her expression that she finds this amusing. Frankly you're embarrassed about the whole thing. You feel like a child with his mother in the grocery store... though... it's kind of nice to have a mother-like figure in your life after going so long without any parents. Although, you won't admit that to any of them. With your little episode out of the way the four of you continue to walk until... </span></div></div>",

In her fur you see a pattern of dark blue stripes while the rest of her fur is a lighter shade of ocean blue. She's dressed in grey jumpsuit that you might find on a mechanic.

They are each dressed in some sort of high tech space suits with helmets hanging off of the neck collar just behind their heads. One is male, while the other is clearly female. The shape of their bodies makes it pretty easy for you to tell which is which. The female also seems to have red eyes while the male's eyes are orange. You honestly have no desire to go anywhere near them but Tammy pushes you along from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once you're within earshot, you can hear Sadie trying to squeeze a little more money out of the two reptiles. \"Are ya sure I can't interest you in some spare parts to go along with these navigation computers? They could come in handy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The male lizard held a palm up and shook his head, \"That's very kind of you to offer but I don't think we have any need for them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you walk up behind Rita, Riley and Sadie the female gecko seems to take notice of you and before you know it she's standing next to you after darting between the three felines that were standing in front of you with frightening agility, \"But perhaps you could tell us more about this... interesting creature...\" She suggest coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shiver as she cups your chin in her cold, gloved palm and turns your face this way and that. It only takes a moment for the girls to register what's happened. Tammy is the first to act as she yanks you away from the gecko woman's grasp, \"Claws off our human!\" She growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The gecko woman puts her hands up in a surrendering fashion, \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend. But perhaps you'd be willing to part with this... human? Was it? For the right price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tammy pulls you closer to her so that your body is compressed between her arms and her stomach while she growls at the lizard, \"He's not for sale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The male gecko then approaches Tammy from the side before stopping a few feet away from her, \"He does seem like an interesting specimen. We' be willing to compensate you generously in exchange for handing him over to us for study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Riley then stepped between the lizard and Tammy, \"My friend said he's not for sale. And he's not a 'specimen', he's a member of our crew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This creature is a member of your crew?\" The gecko asked in disbelief, \"What role does he play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's none of your business,\" Rita interjected, \"You bought our shipment didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That we did,\" The lizard replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then take what you came for and go,\" Rita snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think we'll do just that,\" The female gecko replied. </span></div></div>",

As Sadie reached out to accept the new card, her attention was drawn to faint clanking sound. A small silver disk landed near her feet just as she took the card from the gecko.

Once you were out of sight from the street Sadie knelt down to inspect you. She extended here index claw and moved it horizontally in front of your eyes before moving it vertically.

It definitely would've hit one of you had she not acted. Speaking of which, no sooner than she hit the ground did your protector draw a weapon of her own. It was a gun resembling a brass knuckle with a small barrel just above the index finger. Sadie fired two small orbs of brilliant white light. The first hit it's target; the male lizard who had fired the beam from earlier. When the on impacted his chest white arcs of lightening engulfed his body rendering him motionless for a moment before they dissappeared and allowed him to collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The second shot however, had missed it's target. The female lizard avoided it by sliding under it in a way only a lizard could before proceeding to jump on Sadie. She first wrestled the gun for Sadie's grip and turned it on her. But Sadie reacted quickly and slammed the goggles on top of her head into the lizard woman's snout, causing her to keep back and afford Sadie the opportunity to slap the sidearm out of her hand. The weapon slid across the floor before hitting a wall that was a few feet away. Sadie extended her claws and slashed them across her opponent's face causing her to completely jump off and away from Sadie as she clutched her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lizard woman looked at the blood on the glove of her suit before sneering at Sadie who was now on her feet and barring her fangs with her claws deployed. \"First, I'll leave you in pieces... and then I'll take the human right from in front of your mangled body...,\" She coldly declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well,\" Sadie smirked, \"You're certainly welcome to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Infuriated, the lizard charged the cat. Sadie Easley sidestepped the initial attack and followed up with a punch to the lizards gut. Though she reeled, the lizard maintained her footing and threw herself into Sadie and pinned her to a wall before firing punches like her first were pistons. Left, right, left, right, her fists continuously pounded into the cat who had managed to get her arms up to protect herself, but she was still taking a beating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I've got to do something...\" You muttered. Looking around you found a large metal pipe near your foot. You lifted it up and found it to be deceptively light but no lighter than eight pounds at least. \"This'll do,\" you said to yourself before charging at the lizard. \"Hey scale face!\" You shouted as you neared her, the lizard halted her assault and turned to face you just as you'd begun to swing the pipe like a bat. The pipe slammed into the reptiles side causing her to clench and waiver, but she stayed standing. You responded by spinning three hundred and sixty degrees and striking her again, this time in the stomach causing her to gasp, but nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Faster than you could react she struck you with a backhanded slap across your face. You were stunned, that 'slap' felt like someone took a two-by-four and a Razer to your face at the same time. The impact physically lifted you off of the ground and carried you a few feet away before landing you on your back. You groaned in pain and tried to stand, but you found it nearly impossible to do so with your neck and head hurting so much. You could hear the reptile lady coming your way. \"I've got to get up! She's gonna get me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the lizard knelt down and began reaching for you, Sadie's voice pierced the air, \"Dont you touch him!\" She shouted. The lizard turned around with an arrogant expression expecting Sadie to be shakily holding onto the wall for support. But instead, she found her bringing her fist up for an uppercut. Sadie's fist connected with the lizard woman's jaw sending he'd staggering backwards, but before she got too far away Sadie grabbed her by the wrist and swung her face first into the wall before kicking her legs out from under her and slamming her into the ground on her back. Showing no signs of resistance, the lizard lay limp on the floor, prompting Sadie to rush to you. \"Are you okay?\" She asked as she helped you back onto your feet.</span></div></div>",

The weapon wasn't trained on you though, it was aimed at Sadie. Just before the trigger was squeezed you threw yourself in front of the beam. When it hit you, it felt like you were being electricuted, burned and frozen all at once. When it finally stopped, you fell to the ground, you tried to move your hand but your foot twitched instead. You tried to sit up but nothing happened, a tingling sensation ran down your spine. You vaguely heard three shots fired before you passed out....</span></div></div>",

I knew those guys were sleazy, but I never thought that they would try something like that. But I guess humans are a rarity out here, and not many species have ever seen one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I suppose that makes me valuable,\" You mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Perhaps,\" Rita noted, \"But whatever value you held to them couldn't have compared to how valuable you are to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rita's words cause you to smile a little and blush. This doesn't go unnoticed by Tammy. \"D'aaw, look! He's blushing over what Rita said! This is so cute and adorable, but mostly because he's embarrassed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh shutup!\" You snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh! Looks like I was spot on about him being embarassed,\" Tammy chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Seriously Tammy, knock it off...\" You beg. But this only eggs her on more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Or what short stack? You'll blush some more?\" Tammy laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Riley was going to say something to Tammy when you  surprised the whole group by launching yourself off of the table and into Tammy. The panther stumbled backwards before falling over onto the floor and landed on her back with you sitting on her stomach. However, you were still recovering and quickly remembered this as pain rolled throughout your body. You rolled off of Tammy and groaned in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tammy was also in pain as she clutched the back of her head and hissed. The two of you lay side by side while groaning on the floor. Riley covered her mouth and gasped while Sadie shook her head and sighed, \"I'll go get the first aid kit,\" Sadie muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rita chuckled to herself as she watched you and Riley writhing on the ground, \"I think he'll fit in just fine here,\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You groaned and rolled over swatting the air before you remembered that you didn't have to do that anymore. \"Alarm off,\" You mumbled. The alarm stopped almost immediately. You loved that feature, it was one of the highlights of living in space as far as you were concerned. You sat up and swung your feet out of bed before stretching and heading to your bathroom.

You try to keep your mind off of what's going on around you. It proves to be difficult when you are being affected directly. Crashing and banging are everywhere. It's at that moment you realize that this is yet another part of your new life you'll have to get used to. After a little while all of the shaking stopped and it was calm and silent. However, you didn't like that there wasn't any word from you're feline friends. Part of you wanted to go out and see what was happening. At the same time though, what if you made things worse by being in the way, or what if Sadie found you and was angry that you disobeyed her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The hallway looks empty, just like always. You tentatively stepped out of your room. Still nothing. After a few more seconds, you decide to start walking down the corridors looking for any sign of your crewmates or that alien ship, but after roaming for about five minutes you found nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Maybe they're all on the bridge,\"</i> You thought. You head to the elevator and ride it up to the uppermost deck of the ship. As you walked the corridor you noticed that the door to the bridge was already open. As you got closer you started to hear voices, but there were only a couple you could recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You make your way to the doorway and peak around the corner. You nearly yelp at what you see. Your crew is being held at gunpoint while two wolves, a jackal and what you think is a husky. The husky and one of the wolves appears to be a male. But all of the other canines were definitely female. The male wolf appeared to be in charge, and holding a gun of some sort and aiming it at Rita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We registered five life signs, and yet there's only four of you,\" The wolf snarled, \"Where is the fifth member of your crew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We don't have a fifth crew memeber,\" Rita replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The signal we picked up was kind of weak.

The jackal, female wolf and husky turned to leave the bridge. Seeing the coming danger you turned and ran for the elevator. You made inside and turned around just in time to see the jackal making eye contact with you as the doors shut. You couldn't tell if she'd actually seen you or not. So your crew was being held at gunpoint and a kill squad was coming to get you. The question now was what floor did you need to get to?\"</span></div></div>",

You didn't know what half of them were, and to make matters even more difficult, most of them were too big for you to weild. You settled on a weapon that looked similar to a rifle. It was one of three that hung on a rack which read 'concussion launcher'. You positioned yourself in front of the door and waited. You were sweating bullets, your trigger finger was trembling, your instincts screamed at you to be anywhere other than where you were standing. But the girls needed your help, and running away to prolong the situation wasn't going to help them. You needed to make a stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The door finally groaned and slid open.

There was a bright orange flash. You  couldn't hear or see anything. For a moment you felt weightless, and then you hurt all over. Your vision came back blurry. It slowly began to clear up as you blinked. You were laying up against the wall opposite of the door, the Jackal was sprawled out in the corridor. The weapon you'd used was laying out of your reach several feet away from you. You started to get up when the husky came in with some sort of strange pistol. He had the classic white and black husky colors and blue eyes. He wore a blue suit with armor on the kneepads and shoulder pads. He didn't have any hair and his body was lean but obviously powerful. He was a good bit shorter than Riley, but taller than Sadie and Rita. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You turn your attention back to your sketchbook, currently working on a half-finished sketch of the lake before you; the water softly lapping at the edge of the bolder you are perched on. Around you rustle the remaining leaves on the trees, as the persistent wind tries to pluck the last holdout leaves of the fall season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to concentrate on the drawing taking shape, but your mind keeps wandering back to worrying about your mother. It isn\u2019t easy for your mother, being a single mother after a one night stand all those years ago. With the two jobs she regularly works, you don\u2019t see her very often anymore, and you have yet to be able to keep a job for long to help out. Looking over at the setting sun, you know that you still have a couple hours before she gets to go home. You should be getting on your way though, so you put the finishing touches on your sketch and hop off the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou happen to catch your reflection in the water, the small ripples in the water slowing enough for you to make it out. Your eyes trace over your reflected face, cute and nicely framed by your hair. Your gaze trails down across your 19 year old body, zaftig despite any amount of exercise and/or dieting, so you had just come to accept the small amount of extra weight. Your self-reflection is cut short when you feel like someone or something is watching you and hear a branch snap behind you. Whirling around, you can\u2019t find anything, though you decide to move along anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucking your sketchbook under your arm, you set off, never quite losing the feeling that you are being watched.

Your first thought is that someone is trying to rape or mug you, but that thought is mostly cleared by a quick glance over your shoulder shows a roughly human shape squatting over your prone body, seemingly wearing some type of armor, though it is hard to be sure since you can\u2019t quite focus your eyes on it, the edges of the figure blending with the environment behind it; not exactly standard wear for someone attacking a teenage woman in a forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t get any leverage to try and flip your attacker off, so you try the next best thing: smashing your free arm back into the face. You are rewarded with a slightly loosened grasp, as well as the oddity of a splotch of color matching your jacket slowly spreading partway across the angular and extended helmet. You can\u2019t take advantage of the situation or see the color starting to retract as you are seeing nothing but stars, blinded from the sharp lance of pain radiating up and down your arm from cracking your not-so-funny bone on a hard and relatively unmoving object. You manage to recover enough, certainly faster than your attacker, and twist your other arm free, shoving out from underneath and bolting off. Darting between the trees, you don\u2019t even pay much attention to where you are going, just wanting to put as much distance between you and whoever that was. Your breathing comes fast and ragged and you can hear your heartbeat pounding in your ears as you run as fast as you can, avoiding slipping in the damp leaf litter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick backwards glance to see if they are still pursuing confirms that they are, and quickly gaining. Just as you turn to look where you are running, you crash into something hard and unyielding. Slumped on the ground, you hold your head, trying to will the stars away again. As your vision clears, you wonder if you had blindly ran into a tree or something, but find that you had run into something far worse. Towering over you is another armored figure, roughly humanoid again but even larger, standing about ten feet tall and around three quarters as wide with an elongated helmet perched atop. This one\u2019s armor doesn\u2019t have that warping effect at the edges, metallic plates easily visible and shifting as it bends forward over you, a huge hand reaching down. Scrambling backwards to get away, you instead bump right into the legs of the first one. The big one takes a long step towards you and easily picks you up by your collar in a single hand, holding you in the air with your feet dangling above the ground. Hammering on the arm does little to the giant, only serving to injure yourself some more. The smaller one reaches up and grabs the back of your head, forcing it to the side and holding it as steady as it can with your thrashing. Striking out with your legs does just as well, but you continue to try anything as you see a pistol shaped device in the other hand of the one behind you. Your panicked flailing increases but can\u2019t prevent the thing from being jammed into the side of your neck. A sharp hiss issues from it, and a warmth rapidly spreads around your body from that point, darkness quickly enveloping your mind, your struggles ceasing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Consciousness returns to you slowly, your mind foggy and hazy. Your bed feels odd and lumpy for some reason, but you don\u2019t feel like moving or trying to figure out the issue, content to remain in this limbo stage and hopeful to get back to sleep. Unfortunately, the last lingering vestiges of sleep fade away, and this allows the memories of the dream or whatever it was to drift back to your conscious brain. Remembering that unpleasant event, you sit up straight, and then immediately lay back down, a cacophony of pain and aches flooding back and crashing over you, overwhelming your senses. Your head spins as does the out-of-focus view of the world around you, and you bite your lip to avoid crying out from the pain. Any thought of your attack just being a nightmare is banished as the combination of injuries all demand your limited attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay there, your eyes screwed shut and tearing up; you become aware of a steady vibration coming up through the bed, as well as an almost imperceptible swaying motion. As the pain starts to ebb, you remember back when your mother took you on ferry trips across a local bay and the similar sensations you got then. Did whoever or whatever that grabbed you from the forest take you a boat of some sort? Opening your eyes slowly and carefully looking around, you see a small window set in the wall at the head of the bed, stars easily visible in the night sky outside; how long had you been out? Maybe if you looked outside you could get a clue to where you are and how to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven turning over is a chore, your arms battered and with bruises starting to appear when you were trying to free yourself from the larger attacker. You finally manage it turning over though, standing being the next challenge, and a nearly insurmountable, your legs refusing to take your weight. You eventually settle on an undignified slump against the wall, before pulling yourself to lean against the frame bordering the window. Outside, the stars are vibrant and bright, far brighter than you have ever seen before, even away from the light dome in the cities. There is also no sign of any land in sight, the light sky stretching as far as you can see from your limited field of view. The ship tips slightly again and you get a view that doesn\u2019t quite make sense till your mind makes the proper connection: you aren\u2019t on a boat in the middle of the water at night; you are on a ship in space above the Earth. A sense of panic causes you to want to run, but instead you just tumble to the ground with another bump among all the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpying what appears to be a door across the room, you make your way there, slowly though, crawling and dragging yourself using your forearms. As you move past the bed, you see part of the reason why it felt so odd, consisting of just a thin pad placed in an alcove in the wall. Turning your attention back to the door, you hoist yourself up against the wall next to the door, and realize something rather pivotal: there isn\u2019t a knob, button, level, latch, or anything resembling a way to open the door, just a slightly recessed section of the door that doesn\u2019t do anything in response to your touch. There isn\u2019t enough of a lip to get a grip, and even trying to pull on the edge of the door only results in nearly pulling a fingernail out. A few halfhearted thumps on the door and a hoarse shout provide just as much help, only aggravating your aches and pains. Slipping down the wall to the floor, you pull your knees up and hook your arms around them, despite the flaring ache that causes, burying your head in your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, you perk up as you hear footsteps coming closer, before you try to move away from the door, remembering the two that apparently abducted you. With nowhere to hide though, you are easily visible as the door opens, revealing the smaller attacker. That odd warping effect isn\u2019t in place now, and you can get a better view, revealing armor plates attached to a flexible layer underneath. The helmet is elongated and there is a semi-transparent visor across the top and partway down the sides of the helmet. Behind the visor, you can the rough shape of a face but one that is distinctly non-human, eyes partially visible, narrowing as their owner looks at you. Before you can react, the armored figure leaps at you, and in a flash that pistol device from before is pressed into your neck, the shadow of unconsciousness crashing back over you and dragging you deep into oblivion again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Conciseness returns to you once again, and after a short time, you remember all that has been happening to you. You try to lay as still as possible as you expect your body to start feeling the effects from your injuries yet again. No pain comes though, and trying to move to move your limbs slowly, you only find a hint of stiffness in your joints. The air feels warm and humid, but only somewhat uncomfortably so. Slowly opening your eyes, you find yourself in a room nearly as different from the first as could be: while the first was Spartan and definably favored function over form, the current room is much more lavish with what appears to be pieces of art scattered about. The bed you are laying on is much more impressive as well, rather than just a thin padded mat shoved in a wall alcove, this one is closer to your standard definition of a bed, spreading across many square feet, and covered in shimmering sheets that almost look like silk, but feeling like nothing you have ever touched before, so light and airy that it was like you weren\u2019t touching anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting around to the edge of the bed, you make another discovery: the wall across the room from the end of the bed is one huge unbroken and curving window allowing a view of space beyond. Stepping up to the window cautiously, you are treated to a wondrous sight: Jupiter and its moons drifting slowly to one side as the ship you are on travels out of the solar system. The window looks very thin, certainly thinner than you would think a spaceship would have \u2013 though considering that you seem to be dealing with aliens, it isn\u2019t all hard to grasp \u2013 and grants you an incredible view, almost looking like you could reach out and touch the stellar bodies passing by. As the icy surface of Europa slips past, you think to yourself that you might be the first human to ever travel out here and see these things with your naked eye. Though if some of the alien conspiracy theorists are to be believed, some people might have beaten you out here, and they don\u2019t seem so crazy anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ship continues its journey, the sunward side of Jupiter is replaced with a view of the dark side, flashes of lightning just visible within the cloud layers of the giant world. Turning away from the fleeting lightshow, you turn your attention back to your current situation. You spy several doors around the room as well, but these turn out to be similar to the one from before, with no obvious means of opening them, just that slightly recessed panel that doesn\u2019t respond to your touch. Finding no release there, you instead decide to check out some of the pieces of art, if only keep yourself busy. You can recognize some of them as maybe paintings or sculptures, but others escape your understanding, perhaps too alien for you to grasp. Feeling a bit too warm now, you pull off your coat, draping it over an arm. Before you can inspect any one piece in any great detail, one of the doors quietly whooshes open. You jump a bit in surprise, before settling down. Standing just on the threshold is an alien, you are almost sure of it, though it isn\u2019t a little gray or green man, it looks like a humanoid fox, two legs, two arms, standing upright, fur, tail, the whole shebang. As you look closer, you realize that it might be a vixen, rather than a tod, if the somewhat prominent breasts correspond to her species the same way as it does in humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping just inside the door, it quietly shuts behind her, seemingly without a touch or command given. She stands there, quietly waiting on you. As the initial shock wears off, you realize that this vixen might be the smaller of your two abductors, her stance and basic shape and height are the same, and her loose fighting uniform-like clothing has nearly identical marks as the armor worn by that one as well. What fur you can see is bright red, almost unnaturally so, but with smaller patches of white on her muzzle, hands, and tip of her tail. After a bit of this, she seems to be getting a bit impatient, singling this with a sharp huff and snap of her jaws. Deciding it might be best to not anger her any further \u2013 she could just dump you out an airlock or something after all \u2013 you move closer, not quite sure what she wants from you. This seems to be the right move though, as she spins on her heel and touches that recessed panel on the door, it responds to her touch, opening the door with the same almost complete lack of noise. Checking to make sure you are behind her, she steps out of the door, waits for you to step out, and then sets off down a hallway outside. While walking with your \u201cguide\u201d, you come across several other windows, smaller than the huge wraparound one from before, but granting you other views as these seemed to be on the side of the ship, rather than facing forwards. The shock is still a bit much for you, only numbly following the vixen ahead to wherever she is taking you. As you walked along, you spared a brief thought about the oddity that what almost certainly was alien looked like an awful lot like an anthropomorphic fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for a while, the fox leads you to another room, seemingly overlooking the rear of the ship. Another huge wraparound window dominates the far wall, affording you a view back towards Jupiter. You also see a slight glow below the curve of the rear of the ship, perhaps that\u2019s the engines or thrusters or whatever is propelling the craft. You then turn your attention back to the room and see what is most likely your \u201chost\u201d.</span></div></div>",

As you cast a quick glance around, you realize that the room seems to be a combination sitting room and library: a number of seats curling around facing the rear window and each other, and a few large bookcases across the back wall along with the door you and the vixen entered through as well as another one. A snap draws your attention back to the woman sitting on the sofa and you see that she closed the book she was reading. She stands up, revealing just how tall she is, you guesstimate about a foot shorter than the big thing that grabbed you however long ago. She is also big in width with soft looking onyx scales wrapped around an even softer looking body. A double chin sags from under her muzzle and meaty jowls encroach on her neck; flabby arms frame large fleshy breasts that rest atop a fat stomach that flows across her rotund thighs; her thighs touch along most of their length from what you can see, and press against the top of her calves. Her body is packed into a tight shimmering dress that somewhat resembles the sheets you saw on the bed before, and is topped off with thick lustrous waves of blood-red hair that spill down over her back and shoulders. She brushes a platinum blonde forelock aside, presumably to get a better look at you as you are at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to keep your eyes averted, but can\u2019t help yourself. Something you never told your mother, but you were reasonably sure that you were lesbian. About a year ago, things had heated up between you and one of your longtime friends, a curvy Brazilian that was born and raised in the US. The initial heat cooled quickly though and you never quite could figure out why, but at least you hadn\u2019t lost Isabela\u2019s friendship, even if things were a bit awkward for a while between the two of you. Now though, there is something enthralling about the dragoness before you, the way she looks and the way she moves, that is bringing up some of the feelings from back then, but a bit stronger this time you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sharp huff comes from the vixen that led you from the bedroom; irritated that you were obviously staring maybe? In any case, you try to slow your hammering heart and keep your eyes focused past the dragoness instead. Your eyes snap back though when you hear the most surprising thing: she speaks perfect English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t talk much, does she?\u201d she says, luminous green eyes flicking to the vixen standing just in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shocks just keep coming as the vixen responds much the same, \u201cNo, ma\u2019am. She hasn\u2019t said a word the whole time. She does seem to be a bit more interested in you than me though,\u201d casting a sidelong glance at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026are we sure the translation nanites are functioning properly, or did something go wrong with the healing protocol?\u201d the dragoness asks, as she walks up closer to you, a finger idly rubbing that soft looking chin. \u201cCan you understand me? Can you speak?\u201d she asks of you now, speaking slowly and enunciating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth is dry \u2013 partially from your jaw hanging open in shock \u2013 but you try to speak, \u201cYes, I can understand you, and yes, I can speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness jumps a bit, and then says \u201cOh, splendid, I was starting to get concerned,\u201d clapping her hands once, and your eye follows the ripples that results from that quick motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d you try to steady your whirling mind and your rapid breathing, \u201cYou\u2019re aliens, right; you two and that bigger one that grabbed me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness nods her head, before speaking to the vixen, \u201cYou may return to your duties, Nata.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen \u2013 guard or soldier maybe, you think \u2013 hesitates a few moments before giving what you think might a salute of some sort, and then spinning on her heel and marching back out the door, which shuts behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness moves back towards the sofa, settling her bulk down before speaking to you again, \u201cYou may as well sit down too, this might take a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gingerly lower yourself down on the far end of the seat, your mind still whirling with what you are experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness takes another long look over you before speaking again, \u201cYes, you are correct, to you and other Earthlings, we are aliens and we come from a star system quite some distant from your own, or distant according to your species\u2019 limited space faring abilities. My name is Shira Drakinal, and I deeply apologize for the abruptness of bringing you here, but it was discovered that time may have been quite a factor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me, please, have you been experiencing random bursts of chest pain occasionally, along with a flutter in your heartbeat, and shortness of breath?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026sometimes. My doctor checked me out, but couldn\u2019t find anything majorly wrong. How do you know that and why?\u201d you say with fear starting to creep up on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy sigh, Shira then muttered to herself \u201cWe may have been just in time.\u201d She then looked back up at you, \u201cEven our most basic scanners are more advanced than anything you have on your planet. We\u2026I have been keeping an eye on you,\u201d doing little to diminish that growing fear in you, \u201cand our scans revealed that you have a congenital genetic defect. It is something that is unlikely to be found on your world for a number of decades at best, but far too late for you I am afraid. Rather than letting this happen, I made the decision to have you brought here, our medical technology can also fix this problem given enough time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you kidnapped me\u2026to save my life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026is an oversimplification\u2026, but not an inaccurate one,\u201d she said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you taking me away from my home, couldn\u2019t you have just healed me and dropped me off again?\u201d your fear starting to turn into anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t seem to mind your outburst at all, \u201cAs I said, it will take time to correct this error. Your species is somewhat unfamiliar to our technology; doing too much at one time might prove just as disastrous as doing nothing at all. As for why we are leaving, I have to return to my territory, I\u2019m a <i>kraznak</i> and I have been away for longer than expected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what was that, <i>kraznak</i>?\u201d trying your best to imitate whatever she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira looks up at you in surprise, \u201cHmm\u2026the translation software must not be able to find a close enough match. I think something that you might know would be noble, did that translate correctly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head, and then ask, \u201cTranslation? Is that how you are speaking English, how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out a little laugh, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not speaking English, that\u2019s just what a little collection of injected nanites is making it seem like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch now, you see that her mouth isn\u2019t moving in time with what you are hearing, and if you really strain, you can pick up an identical sounding voice behind the English that is speaking something that is distinctly not English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLikewise, I am hearing a translation of you sounding like you are speaking my language, Ikrodian. In time, the nanites may even let you speak and understand Ikrodian as if you had always known the language, without doing a translation overlay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head and tossing aside for now the idea that they had injected you with something, you decide to go back to a previous frightening point, \u201cWhy have you \u2018been keeping an eye on me\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira actually blushed, her cheek scales turning somewhat reddish, before embarrassedly admitting, \u201cWhile examining your world, I found you out drawing one afternoon. I rather liked the look of your art, and started keeping an eye out to see what else you might draw.\u201d She seems to consider something for a few moments before quietly saying, \u201cI could have kept you unconscious for the whole time that you were being healed, but I thought you might enjoy being able to see things no other humans have before. But if you prefer, I can have you put back in stasis, and all of this will be like a dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to respond that yes, you would, but then reconsider. How often would you get the chance to see the cosmos first hand and encounter real life aliens? You then shake your head, to which Shira gives a slight grin, just enough to curl the edge of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, come along now, we had best be off now,\u201d she says, rising to her feet, your eyes instantly drawn to the quivering that passes through her body as she does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d you ask, trying to hide the blush that is coloring your cheeks and neck.</span></div></div>",

As you take off, you forget about your jacket, leaving it behind on the sofa. Out in the passage, you can scarcely keep your eyes off of Shira\u2019s backside, though it doesn\u2019t help that there aren\u2019t many other things for you to look at. Those wings peeking out from her long waves of hair, that muscular tail flexing and shifting, but especially the rolling mounds of her butt rhythmically moving up and down, you just can\u2019t keep your eyes off them. Shira either doesn\u2019t notice or doesn\u2019t care if she does notice as she walks along. She starts pointing out some things as she goes; down that staircase is the engineering section, through that door is the medical bay, there\u2019s a hanger bay on the lower level of the ship, and so on till you reach the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can go on a bit more involved tour after I\u2019m finished here, if that would be alright?\u201d she asks, looking back over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head and considering that no one stops you, follow her onto the bridge. The room looks much like some of those you have seen on a number of science fiction programs: a number of computer stations scattered around with anthros of a number of species occupying some of them, holographic displays, and another stunning view of space out the front window. Shira made straight for the station at the front, the pilot\u2019s station from the looks of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe still on schedule, Koval?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, my lady, we should actually be able to jump a bit earlier than initially planned,\u201d the raccoon says with obvious respect to Shira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent, keep up the good work,\u201d she responds, giving him a pat on the shoulder, to which he nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes a circuit of the bridge, checking in with each person, and giving praise or encouragement as needed. You instead linger towards the back, not wanting to get in the way of anything, as well as just trying to watch the goings on. After Shira finishes talking with the last, she motions towards you as she makes her way to a chair centered in the back of the room; raised a step above the rest of the room, the chair is also somewhat more ornate than the completely functional chairs of the rest of the bridge staff. She settles down in what must be her chair, affording her a view of the whole bridge, and you step up beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another few moments of listening to the muted conversations and noises from the bridge, you work up enough nerve to speak up, \u201cBefore, you mentioned \u2018my territory\u2019, what did you mean by that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Oh, I meant exactly that,\u201d she touches a control on the arm of her chair, and a glowing holographic display appears in the air before her. \u201cWe are here, your home system,\u201d motioning to what is obviously a depiction of the solar system containing Earth and so on, as well as a little icon heading out past Jupiter which must be the ship. \u201cMy people have spread across a number of star systems,\u201d as she hits several more controls and the view zooms out and moves rapidly to show a portion of the galaxy with a collection of solar systems enclosed in a red colored field. \u201cWe Ikrodens started out much like yours, on a single world in a system much like yours,\u201d pointing at one specific star near the center of the region, \u201cbut have spread to many others across a large section of space. I oversee this portion here,\u201d with a few more presses, a blue field encloses a few stars at one edge of the Ikroden territory. \u201cMost of the tasks are handled by administrations that manage the mining and production factories, make sure that resources are distributed correctly, and handle disputes, that sort of thing. I do have to step in sometimes when a situation might affect the whole region, or even the entire Ikroden territory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIkroden, you are the anthropomorphic dragons?\u201d after seeing a number of different species, you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no, Ikroden refers to all of us, and yes, we do look like the furries and scalies of your world\u2019s fictions. All of the races of the Ikroden look much like anthropomorphic animal species of your world, but we are all one people from one species despite the outward differences. The differences between the races of the Ikroden don\u2019t matter so much; two beings that resemble Earth species that might not be a match on your world can freely interact and even produce children, though most children that result from a mixed mating tend to have only traits from their mother rather than mixing traits from both parents.\u201d She then looks and speaks a bit louder towards a falcon seated to one side on the bridge, \u201cPolk, your father was a bull, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Polk responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how are you parents doing,\u201d Shira then asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, ma\u2019am, I just received a message from home while we were in orbit. My sister aced her final exams, in case you were wondering too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is good to hear,\u201d she says, and he nods before returning his attention to the display before him. She then turns those lovely green eyes back your way, \u201cAny other questions you want answered?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \u201cNothing right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bows her head slightly, before switching something on the armrest again, so that the image of the galaxy vanishes and is replaced with several floating pages with scrolling text on them. This does spark something else that you want to know about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I may, why do you have those books if you have holograms instead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up at you, a little color in her cheeks again and what you assume to be an abashed expression, \u201cDon\u2019t laugh, but I like the feel of the paper in her hands, and the smell you get from old books. These holograms are nice, but they just can\u2019t beat something like that sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I laugh, I\u2019m actually much the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn\u2019t say anything at that, but she does make a little hum at the back of her throat. After a bit, you pace around at the back of the room, looking over some of the screens at the unoccupied stations, but don\u2019t have a hope of understanding. A short time later, Koval speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am, we\u2019re approaching the edge of the system, we\u2019ll be ready to jump within a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026we are a bit ahead of schedule, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Shira says looking up from one of the screens in front of her, to which the raccoon nods. Then she looks over at you, \u201cYou might want to take a seat and strap in,\u201d pressing a button on her chair and then motioning towards a seat that silently folds out of the floor beside her own, \u201cA jump can be unpleasant for those unaccustomed to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you take the seat \u2013 realizing that the seat was obviously made to handle someone much larger than yourself \u2013 and automatically get strapped down, you ask, \u201cA jump? Some faster-than-light travel, I\u2019m guessing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira gives a smile, her numerous sharp teeth glinting, \u201cVery good, you are correct. I don\u2019t know all the details myself; it\u2019s all extremely complex and goes way over my head, but the Ikroden couldn\u2019t have spread as far as we could have without that marvelous drive system.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did we have to come out to the edge of the system? Couldn\u2019t you have just jumped from where we were, near Earth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than answering, she looks over at another person on the bridge, \u201cSisha, perhaps you would like to field those questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe somewhat short and stocky polar bear turns slightly, \u201cOf course, ma\u2019am.\u201d Then she addresses you, \u201cLarge gravity wells can interfere with the FTL calculations and process, so moving away from a large gravity source \u2013 such as a star \u2013 makes things far simpler and easier. In addition, moving to FTL travel produces a noticeable energy signature, moving far enough away from an underdeveloped world means that there is much less likely to any undue exposure. Since we are this far out, the energy might be detected by your world as a cosmic blip rather than a massive burst of exotic energies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Sisha,\u201d first to Sisha, then you, \u201cThat answer your question?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira nods again, turning her attention back to the screens floating in front of her. At the front of the bridge, Koval hits some buttons next to him before speaking, his voice also coming out of speakers it sounds like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll hands, prepare for jump.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then starts counting down, his hands flying over his panel doing whatever it is he is doing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cJump commencing,\u201d Koval announces at the end of the countdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou become aware of a rising whine, but it\u2019s less something you hear, and more something you feel, it actually feels like it\u2019s vibrating the molars in the back of your mouth. The sensation only gets worse as the moments pass; it gets so bad that you almost miss how the empty space in front of the ship is warping and stretching. Suddenly with a lurch, the ship leaps forwards into the strange effect and down a tunnel made of spiraling twisting splashes of colors. You can\u2019t really pay attention to that though, it feels like your head is being turned inside out, and you are feeling extremely nauseous. Through the fog that is wrapping around your head, you can almost make out Shira saying something, not enough to understand it but she sounds concerned you think, but soon enough it doesn\u2019t matter as the fog completely envelopes your mind and you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap awake, and feel somewhat queasy, but not terribly so. You are back in the opulent bedroom you woke up in before you met Shira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if on cue, you hear Shira\u2019s voice, now a sultry purr, \u201cAh, good, you\u2019re awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is standing in the doorway, her arms braced on either side and her eyes are half lidded as she stares at you. You are about to ask about what happened, but your voice catches in your throat as she sashays into the room, her dress dropping to the ground as she does so, leaving her soft scaly body completely bare. Your heartbeat pounds in your chest as your eyes whip this way and that, taking in every curvy pound on display before you. Before you can do anything else, she pounces on you, so much warm soft flesh oozing across your body, you can barely restrain yourself. You clear your throat and try to speak again, but she presses two fingers to your mouth, small claws teasing your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush,\u201d she barely breathes, \u201cLet\u2019s get rid of these naughty distractions first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans back, straddling your legs and rising above you, the soft lighting above her granting you a silhouette of the dragoness and her myriad curves as well as casting you in her shadow. She reaches down and without any fanfare, tugs off your sweatshirt and tosses it aside, which is quickly joined by your shirt fluttering in the air. Her hands trace across your body, leaving a trail of goose bumps in their wake, while you can see the glint of her teeth in the shadows of her mouth. She leans down again, your soft flesh yielding to her much softer flesh and bringing a moan to your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been wanting to do this,\u201d she whispers in your ear, her breath tickling as she does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair falls down in waves around you like a curtain, then lightning quick she pounces again, this time pressing her muzzle to your mouth. At first, you\u2019re in a bit of shock, but with a little time, Shira gets you in the swing of things. Her long narrower tongue darts into your mouth, wrapping about yours several times and giving a little squeeze, giving you a little thrill and making you arch your back. She reaches down and you feel her undo your pants, and tug them off, the discarded article soon joining the rest of the clothing on the floor. The kiss continues on for a time, longer than you were expecting, but you have to break it when you feel out of breath. Oddly, your breath doesn\u2019t return yet, it is still hard for you to breath and it\u2019s actually getting harder. That\u2019s when you see it: Shira is getting bigger, fatter, heavier, and you can actually see her body swelling as you watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must see the surprise on your face, because she lets out a little laugh, then says, \u201cWhat, are you surprised that all that feeding you\u2019ve been doing is having an effect on me? But let\u2019s hurry things up a bit, more food is coming and I\u2019m simply ravenous,\u201d her teeth gleaming in the light, but the look on her face suggests she\u2019s hungry for something more than just food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breathing is getting bad enough that it\u2019s hard to speak, to question what she meant, but you don\u2019t want it to stop. The feeling of her weight crushing you into the bed, the heat and lovely smell you are getting off of her, the feeling of all of this soft flesh pouring over you, every bit is simply divine. Her expanding hasn\u2019t stopped or slowed, if anything it\u2019s sped up; you can see her body slowly rising further and further over you as her stomach expands pressing higher overtop of you. Her breasts are similarly affected, spreading higher and higher, pooling around your neck and encroaching on your face. Oh, to be drowned in dragoness flesh, that isn\u2019t something you haven\u2019t considered before, but you can\u2019t move to stop it, even if you wanted to. The bed creaks and groans and you moan as the pressure continues to mount. Shira just continues to smile, sometimes jostling her body, sending waves that you can feel with your whole body. She flicks her tongue out, the forked tip tickling your nose, and somewhat distracting you from a different motion. Soon enough, you feel it though: her long thick tail wiggling and wriggling, snaking up between your legs. She pauses as her tail reaches her target, the tip just tickling your slit. You shift your hips as much as you can against the weight pressing down you, wanting her to continue. She smiles that lovely smile again, before leaning down to nip at your neck. You can feel her tail tense up and prepare yourself\u2026then you wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a hammer blow, you bolt awake, your chest heaving and your body soaked with sweat. As you take stock, you realize that your hand is tucked in the waist of your pants, fingers just teasing like Shira\u2019s tail\u2026in the dream, you realize. You groan as you tug your hand free, wiping your fingers on your pants after you do so. Your head still feels odd and your stomach is a bit off kilter, but it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re going to throw up now. You\u2019re in a different bedroom, a bit less ornate than what must be Shira\u2019s but several grades above the Spartan room you woke up in the first place. Outside a small window, you can see the colored tunnel shooting past. The light proves oddly soothing and you feel your eyelids drooping no matter how hard you try. Soon you are falling asleep, rather than just going unconscious, but a little fluttering thought moves to the front: you hope to have another dream like that one.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Consciousness returns to you much easier this time, and you feel better as you awake. That last though comes back around and after a bit, you realize that you didn\u2019t have any further dreams, not even like <i>that</i> one. Sitting up on the edge of the bed, you stretch your arms way up, feeling your back pop in several places as you do so. As you noticed the first time around, the room you find yourself in is rather luxurious, but somewhat less so than the first room you woke up in. You notice that outside the window, the tunnel of light from the FTL travel is gone; it is instead replaced with star speckled space again. Getting up and walking over to the window, you realize that the ship is now orbiting a planet, an actual alien world from the looks of things. A lush green world spins beneath your view with far less visible water than you might expect. Bands of reddish clouds dot the upper atmosphere, though a larger purplish mass of clouds seems to be letting loose with rain and lightning. One of the more telling parts that you aren\u2019t around Earth is the fact that you can see two distinct moons circling this world, in addition to several large space stations\u2014one of which you seem to be heading towards. You briefly wonder if you are more of a prisoner than anyone is letting on, especially with how often you seem to be confined to rooms by yourself; this is quite a posh jail cell though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander around a bit, before a whim sends you towards the door. Still no sign of any means of opening the door except for that recessed spot again. On another whim, you touch that spot and are surprised when the door opens. There\u2019s no sign of anyone outside the door, so that helps dispel some of the thought that you are a prisoner; a prisoner would likely be locked in the room and have a guard stationed if the door wasn\u2019t locked\u2026right? You waver for a moment before stepping out of the room; you don\u2019t feel like just waiting around to be collected again. Perhaps you should have though, because within a few minutes you find yourself lost in the passageways of the ship; some of the doors still won\u2019t respond to your touch. The ship doesn\u2019t seem to be city sized or anything, but it is still large enough that you haven\u2019t seen anyone nor have you found anything recognizable. You are about to try calling out to see if anyone would hear you when you hear someone grunting and exclaiming from up ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the noises towards their source \u2013 since you don\u2019t seem to have many other options \u2013 you come to a large room that seems to be set up like a training room or dojo or whatever. The sole occupant seems to be doing hand to hand combat against floating holographic targets. He is a gigantic wolf, silver and black fur covering huge mounds of muscles that are barely concealed under his flexing hide. He is bare from the waist up \u2013 his thick fur shining from sweat - and his teeth are bared as he punches, kicks, elbows, head butts, and whatever else he can do as he tears into the targets. Too focused on his task, he doesn\u2019t notice you. Looking around, you spot sections of armor stacked on a bench close to you, armor that you recognize as that worn by the giant that grabbed you however long ago on Earth. Looking back at the wolf, it clicks: this very well may be the massive figure that hefted you one handed while Nata, the vixen, drugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last of the targets shatters under one of his blows, he seems to drop into something almost meditative: his posture relaxed, his eyes shut, and his breathing already slowing. After a few moments of that, he fur on the back of his neck stands up a bit and he cracks one eyelid open, fixing the golden orb squarely on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I smelled you here,\u201d he says, his voice is a deep rumble mixed with boulders grinding together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a little annoyed, \u201cSorry, I haven\u2019t exactly been able to clean up since you guys grabbed me\u2014whenever you did that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t insulting you, or at least I didn\u2019t mean to, I merely meant that you are different and have a different scent, that is all,\u201d the wolf says, holding his hands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d you respond, a little bit of color flushing your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut where are my manners in any case; T\u2019hol, at your service,\u201d he says, performing that salute or whatever that you saw Nata the vixen perform. \u201cWas there something you needed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d you answer, shaking your head, before you turn the shake into a nod. \u201cActually yes, I got a little lost\u2026all right, very lost. I was looking for Shira, and I had no idea where I was going, and ended up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT\u2019hol gives a throaty little rumble, and it takes you a few moments to realize that he is chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then says, \u201cDo not be concerned, that happened to me before, as well as Nata when we first came on board. I can take you to her if you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a bit before giving a tiny nod. The wolf bows his head before motioning for you to follow him back out into the hallway. He sets a quick pace, his long legs granting him an even longer stride, but you do your best to keep up. As you follow, you pick up a musky sent wafting off of him, and while it doesn\u2019t stir anything in you, you don\u2019t find it unpleasant either. T\u2019hol says that you will be able to clean yourself and even get a change of clothes shortly, if you so desire. You mumble that might be nice. He nods his head before turning his full focus back on where he is walking. You don\u2019t recognize anything yet, but he certainly seems to know where he is going. Soon enough, he leads you to Shira in\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>T\u2019hol leads you to a room that appears to be in the center of the ship, though it is hard for you to be sure. The room seems to be a medical room, gleaming metal, complex machines, bed-like structures, and a vaguely familiar antiseptic smell that triggers memories of the hospital. The wolf looks around momentarily before marching off to a side door, beyond which lies what is mostly recognizable as an office. Following him in, you hear two people speaking; one is Shira, and the other sounds like another woman. Your thought is soon proved correct as you step into the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress, Sarah, the human was looking for you, so I brought her to you,\u201d T\u2019hol says, bowing his head so that his chin is shoved to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, we were just talking about you, Sarah, were your ears burning?\u201d Shira says with a bit of a laugh, then looking towards T\u2019hol, \u201cYou can return to your training, T\u2019hol.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bows his head again and salutes her before marching off, leaving you with the two women. The other woman is tall with a voluptuous figure that inspires a bit of envy in you. She is also very distinctly a cow with short white fur splotched with black patches, from what you can see of it. Clad in a form fitting body suit that reveals every nuance of her figure, your eyes are drawn first to her huge gravity defying breasts\u2014each bigger than her head. You can also see her wide shapely hips below the edge of the desk she is sitting behind, and a plush belly that is almost lost in the shadows of her bust. Her thick luminous black waves of hair are mostly tied into a braid that extends down to where her tail flicks around behind her. You again guesstimate her height to be not quite as tall as Shira and certainly not as tall as T\u2019hol, but still more than tall enough to stand over you were she standing. She casually pushes the slender eyeglasses perched atop her nose a little higher, and you get a better view of her sky blue eyes staring right back at you. With a gulp, you realize that you are staring at her just like you did Shira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah, may I introduce my Chief Medical Officer, Lyra,\u201d Shira says, waving her hand towards the other woman, as if to dispel some of the awkwardness lingering in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d you say, holding your hand out, and you can feel a blush heating your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually already met,\u201d Lyra says, standing up and taking your hand, and then noting the look on your face, \u201cyou were unconscious at the time though. It was shortly after you were brought on board for your first treatment. Speaking of, are you feeling better since then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, quite, except for the nausea and everything during the jump,\u201d you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I heard about that, and I apologize about that, I wasn\u2019t expecting it to have such an adverse effect on you,\u201d Lyra says coming around to perch on the side of the desk near you. Shira chimes in with her own apology too, before Lyra speaks again, \u201cI should be able to adjust the next treatment to help deal with that situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Treatment\u2019? You mean for that condition you detected in me?\u201d you ask, looking between Shira and Lyra, getting nods from both. \u201cAll right, when can get started, I would rather not go through that again, and definitely don\u2019t feel like dying yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was actually going to have you brought here now, so we could get started. If you would please follow me,\u201d Lyra responds, leading you back out into the main part of the lab\u2014granting you an excellent view of her rump bobbing around in front of you while she does so. She then motions for you to lay down in one of the beds in the room, and you do so. She walks up to the wall above the bed \u2013 giving you a great view of her breasts\u2013 and brings up a holographic interface. She hits a few \u201cbuttons\u201d on the display, and a clear shell closes around you and the bed before an arm starts slowly winding back and forth in a track on the outside of the shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you are awake this time, I will have to tell you, remain as still as you can, it will make things proceed a bit quicker,\u201d Lyra says, her voice seemingly coming from a speaker within your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head in understanding. On the next pass, the arm emits a green light in a broad beam that seeps across you, leaving you more than a little itchy in its wake; you do your best to hold still though. Shira walks up on the other side of the bed, casting a casual glance down at you, and giving a little smile when you look back at her. Despite yourself, you feel drawn to both women, Shira with her extremely soft frame, and Lyra with her exaggerated curves. Should you really be feeling attracted to aliens though, even if they are aliens who happen to resemble anthros? Plus, both of them seemed like they were a bit out of your age range, though you couldn\u2019t be sure on that count, maybe they aged differently than humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts and more continue to whirl through your head \u2013 as well as an almost irresistible urge to start scratching all over due to the beam \u2013 as the machine makes numerous more passes back and forth. The monotonous motion and more than a little boredom soon make you nearly nod off, till the sound of the arm stops and the beam shuts off. With a hiss, the shell opens up, letting you out of what you now realize is getting a bit stifling within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go, that\u2019s the second treatment finished, and you shouldn\u2019t have nearly as much issue with FTL travel now,\u201d Lyra said, still examining the holographic display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo <i>doc</i>, any idea how many more treatments it might take?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems half lost in thought, manipulating several holo displays now, but manages to murmur, \u201cHard to say for sure, but I would expect approximately twelve more sessions might be sufficient.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround twelve more times of this, not exactly what you are hoping for, but if it saves your life, you think you can put up with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira then speaks up, \u201cIs she cleared to leave for now, Lyra? We should be about to dock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStirring out of her thoughts, \u201cOf course, ma\u2019am, she may leave now if she wishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira then turns to you, \u201cWell, it\u2019s up to you then, do you want to come with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou pause for a moment before answering, \u201cYes, but do you think I can get cleaned up sometime soon, and maybe get a change of clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira nods her head before saying, \u201cI think that can be arranged.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shira leads you out of the medical lab and back into the increasingly familiar hallways of the ship\u2014or at least familiar in style since you are still have minimal ability to navigate through the bowels of the vessel. Again, you can\u2019t quite keep your eyes from the dragoness\u2019s rolling rump, now shimmering beneath a similar but still somewhat different dress, but you are also left thinking about Lyra now no matter how much you want to avoid thinking of either of them in such a way. It doesn\u2019t take long before the two of you enter what must be a hanger bay; its smaller than you were expecting, just enough room for the pair of smaller ships contained within to maneuver their way out of the bay door that makes up the far wall. Rather than heading for either of the shuttles, Shira instead leads you to a small locker room connected to the hanger. The dragoness then pulls out a flexible suit from one of the lockers; you soon realize that the suit seems to be a spacesuit of some sort, though much less bulky than you are used to seeing from Earth. Shira briefly holds it up to you, likely checking the size against you. Seemingly satisfied, she hands it to you before strutting behind the center bank of lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t need that, but I always believe in being prepared,\u201d she calls out as she vanishes about the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in understanding \u2013 despite knowing that she can\u2019t see your motion \u2013 since you believe much the same. You wonder if you are supposed to put it on or just hold onto it just in case, and start to move around the lockers to ask but freeze in place for a moment before darting back to the other side, your cheeks blazing at the brief image of Shira stripping off her dress revealing the soft flesh beneath. Shaking your head does little to dispel the lingering picture from your mind, but you still try to focus on the suit hanging in your hands. Figuring that you should be putting the suit on yourself, you next wonder if you should strip down as well, but find that this likely won\u2019t be needed when you discover the suit should be more than large enough to fit over your clothes. Soon enough, you have slipped the suit on and find that it is even larger than you first thought, the extra material bunching up around your body, likely a sign that it was made for someone a good bit larger than yourself. You also discover that there is no sign of a helmet, whether as part of the suit or in the locker the suit came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Shira coming to your side of the locker, you start to ask her about this, but your voice catches in your throat when you see her step out, now clad in a similar suit; but while yours is loose and baggy, hers is skin tight, the shiny material pulled taut across her rotund frame. You try to keep your eyes away from her body, but fail completely as your gaze roams the myriad curves highlighted by the outfit. There\u2019s little doubt that Shira hasn\u2019t noticed your wandering eyes, especially now, and the next time your eyes make the long journey up to her face, you see signs that she has indeed noticed, but rather than annoyance or anything negative, you instead see a little twinkle of mirth in her eyes and a slight curl of a smile on her lips giving you a slightly hopeful feeling. She doesn\u2019t say anything about this encounter, instead telling you to follow her back out into the bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do so, and she heads right for the smaller of the two ships: mostly a small cargo bay with a few seats set into the walls along both sides and the cramped cockpit to the front of the rear compartment. T\u2019hol and Nata are already seated and chatting amicably while they wait, and they both bow their heads respectfully as Shira breezes past heading straight for the cockpit. The vixen motions for you to take a seat, and you barely do so before the rear hatch whooshes closed and the shuttle rises off of the hanger floor. Through a small window in the wall behind your seat, you see your current transportation zip out of the bay door and are promptly hit with a fluttering feeling in your stomach and a lack of sensation from your seat beneath you. It takes you a few seconds before you realize that you\u2019re weightless and not secured down, unlike the two across from you. T\u2019hol lets loose with a little bit of a deep rumble that you can only interpret as his laughter as you scramble to take your seat again before figuring out the harness. The giant wolf unstraps and floats across the space between the two of you to assist you. You tell him thanks as he drifts back to his seat giving you a slight bob of his head. Now secured down, you spare a thought for the wonders of artificial gravity that the Ikroden obviously had; it certainly makes things easier to handle in space than everything freely floating about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning your attention back to the window, you watch in awe as the green world grows steadily larger as the shuttle hurtles through the vacuum behind the atmosphere. Craning your neck and nearly pressing your nose to the \u201cglass\u201d you can also see the ship you came from nestled in the embrace of the station you saw before. You feel a subtle shift shortly before a slight thump that you figure might signal atmospheric entry. You continue to stare out the window as new details are slowly revealed as the ship continues to rocket towards the ground. You soon make out trees that are somewhat familiar to you, but seemingly far larger than the largest known on Earth if you understand what you are seeing correctly. You can also see rivers and lakes, but still no oceans or even seas from what you can tell. There are mountains though, large ranges that are nearly dwarfed by the trees that swallow most of their flanks except for the peaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel another shift as the shuttle banks slightly, dipping closer to the thick canopies of the trees below. You can see Shira\u2019s hands gliding over the control surface of the shuttle in the cockpit, her eyes focused out of the front window as she continues to control the shuttle through the atmosphere. Leaning forward as far as your harness allows, you can make out that the shuttle is heading for a particular mountain range in the distance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You soon see a glimmer that appears on the peak of one of the mountains the shuttle is heading for. As you continue to get closer, you can see more and more details until you are reasonably sure that you\u2019re looking at a structure, and a large one at that. Eventually you are sure that you are heading for a very large building or collection of buildings built on the crest of the centermost and tallest mountain in the range. Shira\u2019s fingers continue their motions across the controls, and in response the shuttle slows down for landing. Just before the mountain slips below the edge of the cockpit window, you see something that shocks you: the building is not built <u>on</u> the mountain, the bottom of the bowl-like platform it rests on is hovering quite a distance over the rocks below, yet another sign of Ikrodian technological prowess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shuttle settles on a landing pad built into the surface of the platform with barely a thump, and the rear hatch lowers similarly to how it raised just a short time ago. You feel a waft of damp air rushing into the shuttle, and smell something in the breeze that almost reminds you of an earthy scent with something else that you can\u2019t quite figure out. Before Shira leaves the cockpit, she hits a few more \u201ckeys\u201d and just like that a very subtle thrumming sensation that you barely notice vanishes; the engines of the shuttle shutting down, you assume.  Shira then appears in the doorway, looking pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problems back here, right?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing insurmountable,\u201d Nata says, her eyes flicking in your direction, followed by T\u2019hol\u2019s response, \u201cYour flying was wonderfully as usual, my lady.\u201d You then manage to somewhat find your voice, \u201cI just wasn\u2019t ready for weightlessness, I wasn\u2019t belted down when we launched.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira gets a look that you interpret as embarrassed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I should have warned you about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wave it off, and she nods before leading everyone out onto the landing pad outside, T\u2019hol\u2019s and Nata\u2019s armor glinting in the sunlight peaking through the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to Eylara,\u201d the dragoness proclaims with more than a little pride in her voice as she casts a quick glance over her shoulder at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit that, the world is extremely impressive, beautiful even, and that\u2019s not even considering that you\u2019re standing on an alien planet circling an alien star. Before you can say anything though, an extremely diminutive owl comes dashing around the ship, his snowy feathers so fluffed out that he looks somewhat larger than he really is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon me, my lady,\u201d he says after skidding to a stop and bowing so low that he is momentarily bent completely in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is no problem, <i>mitok</i> Klyne, what is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pauses momentarily, his head spinning around nearly one hundred and eighty degrees to glance at you with saucer sized orange eyes\u2013 making you feel more than a little ridiculous still swamped in the oversized spacesuit \u2013 before spinning around to continue speaking with Shira, \u201cThe situation on Mota Prime is worse than initially expected, I thought you might want to oversee the matter yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, thank you for bring it to my attention,\u201d Shira says while setting off towards the entrance with the little owl man following in her wake, before calling back over her shoulder, \u201cNata, can you see to Sarah in the meantime?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, ma\u2019am,\u201d the vixen responds, then turning to the wolf still at her side, \u201cI\u2019ll join you as soon as I am able then, T\u2019hol.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant wolf gives a little nod and a rumble from deep in his chest before following the route taken by Shira and the other, but at a more sedate pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNata has already turned back to you, \u201cShall we?\u201d motioning towards the door that everyone seems to be using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and the two of you move along, but along the way you ask, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, what does <i>mitok</i> mean, the\u2026translation didn\u2019t trigger on that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems lost in thought for a few moments before answering, \u201cAnother way to say it would be regent; did that translate correctly?\u201d After you nod, she continues on explaining, \u201cHe oversees the estate when Lady Shira is away, as well as overseeing most operations throughout this region of space.\u201d You nod in understanding, and continue walking alongside Nata in silence, but she then speaks up, \u201cIf you would like, we can have someone look into the translation system when we have a chance, it wouldn\u2019t do to miss something important, would it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in agreement again and the two of you continue walking first through the gilded doors and then through opulent halls that leave you more than a little dazzled. Artwork abounds, though you are only partially certain that some if it is artwork as you understand it. You nearly run into the vixen when she stops in front of a door. She opens it and steps aside, ushering you inside, revealing a bedroom nearly rivaling Shira\u2019s on the ship. She then surprises you by saying that this will be your room, though you are actually somewhat expecting it at this point. As you are still dealing with the shock that came from that revelation, she points out another door and says that the bathroom is through there, before asking if you needed any assistance in that matter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You tell her no, you should be able to manage, how difficult could it be after all? Nata looks almost dubious, just for a split second before she hides it away. Nodding again, she turns on her heel before shutting the door behind her, leaving you alone in a room probably worth more than your mother\u2019s entire home. Dismissing the little shiver traveling down your spine, you turn your attention to the bathroom door and what lies beyond. The door opens at your touch and the room behind it is more than you a imagining: beautiful fixtures that seem more like artwork than something that should be sullied with something as low as cleaning you, as well as a mosaic of jewel-like stones that make sweeping curves across the whole floor, and a huge sunken tube in the center of the room. You focus more on the alcove in the far wall, considering that it looks close enough to a shower for you. A subconscious tap on your shoulder makes you take a quick glance around before stripping out of the baggy spacesuit and your own clothes beneath, and tossing everything into piles at the base of the wall as you step inside. As soon as you are just inside the alcove, a door soundlessly slips out of the wall, sealing you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you start to reconsider your decision of denying assistance, since there aren\u2019t any knobs, handles, or even buttons. Thinking of the panels on the various doors though makes you look for a similar panel here and quickly find it. Raising your hand to nearly touch it, and watch with more than a little amazement as the featureless indent comes alive with light and color. Not that this helps you much, since you can\u2019t read or understand any of the symbols displayed there; you again think about getting some help but decide to press on and do your best, figuring it is just a shower after all, though a small twinge in your mind hopes that it\u2019s just a shower. Looking the panel over again and again, you find a likely possibility and touch it, and are rewarded not with a stream of water, but instead with clouds of steam shooting out of the walls hitting you from all directions as well as a steady pulsing that gives you an almost ticklish sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp as the wave of heat overtakes you, taking your breath away. Sweeping your arm to try to clear the obscuring cloud of steam and reveal the panel again, you frantically look for something that might be a temperature control. Poking the possibility once does lessen the heat but not enough, prompting you to hit it several times; the steam is still extremely hot but much more manageable now. You soon find a small shelf built out from the wall that has what appears to be soap and shampoo, and are soon lathering your body up as the waves of steam washes it away. The shampoo is pleasantly floral scented, and reminds you of some from Earth, but not quite. It doesn\u2019t take long before the shampoo suds are rinsed from your hair too, but you linger in the shower, savoring the wet heat and subtle vibrations washing over your body. As you stand there, your mind wanders, and again get images of Shira flitting through your mindscape. You see the dragoness in the skintight spacesuit again, but now she is being fed huge amounts of food by your hand. In your mind\u2019s eye, Shira bloats up at an impossible speed, swelling out against the confines of the taut material, till it starts to rip and tear, exposing more of her flesh. Your wandering mind also adds Lyra in, feeding Shira as well and causing the dragoness to expand even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head vigorously just as your imagined Shira bursts out of the suit, and find yourself panting from both the heat and your building arousal. Stabbing a finger at the panel, you manage to shut everything down and open the door; the last trace of steam billowing and fading as the seal is released, leaving you feeling cleaner than you ever have before. The relative chill in the air after the heat of the shower hits you like a ton of bricks, chilling the water still clinging to your skin and already causing your teeth to chatter. You find a towel and dry off as quickly as you can, which helps to take the chill away, before tying a second towel around your body. You remember seeing a closet out in the bedroom portion of the suite and want to check if you can find anything else that might fit you before getting back into your own dirty clothes.</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s not something you have seen before, almost as tall as T\u2019hol but far thinner; he looks to be an armadillo, but there is something simian to his face and hands as well. He\u2019s dressed in a stylish jack and paints that again remind you of a uniform. You also notice how he is extremely careful to keep his eyes averted, but you still pull the towel around your body a bit better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clears his throat before saying, \u201cKrole, at your service,\u201d bowing so low that his dark hair falls like a curtain about his face. Rising, he continues, \u201cLady Shira sent word that you would most likely require a change of clothes,\u201d and without shifting his gaze, he points to the small pile on the foot of the bed. \u201cIt is the best that could be done on such short notice, but we should be able to do better tomorrow if that will be satisfactory, ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are left momentarily stunned by how well everyone seems to be treating you, before recovering and saying, \u201cYes, that will be fine.\u201d You start to walk over to the pile of clothes, but stop after a couple steps and turn back to him, \u201cEh, what about my dirty clothes, I just left them and the suit lying in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour clothing will be sterilized and returned to you. If you wish however, we can perhaps use your own clothing as a basis for what we will provide to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head again, and start to head over to them, but just before you reach them, he speaks up again, saying that he will wait outside for you till you are ready. Almost soundlessly, he leaves you alone, letting you look over the clothing provided. Both are similar to the uniforms you have seen, but less ornate and more functional, and now that you can touch them, the fabric is extremely smooth and light feeling, but completely opaque as well. The material slides effortlessly over your body, feeling cool to the touch, but keeping you warm at the same time. With that taken care of, your body seems fit to remind you that you haven\u2019t eaten in however long and grumbles loudly, though not as much as you think it should be. When it passes, you move quickly to the door and find Krole waiting as he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to ask if you could get something to eat, but the armadillo-ape is already speaking, \u201cLady Shira also mentioned that you might be hungry as well. If you would like, I could take you to get something to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and he quickly turns and heads down the hallway, leading you along. He doesn\u2019t say any more and you don\u2019t feel like trying to speak up, just wanting to get something to eat, so the only noises that follow in your wake are the clacking of hard soles and the soft swishing of the clothing as the two of you walk along. Soon enough, your nose starts to be tickled by a collection of smells coming from ahead of you; they range from somewhat familiar to those that are totally unrecognizable to you, but together they make your stomach grumble in anticipation. Krole soon comes to another door and quickly opens it before stepping aside and letting you walk in first, revealing\u2026</span></div></div>",

Eighteen years and a handful of weeks ago, you (Isabelle Fuentes) were born to a unwed teenage Latina mother who had no high school degree, no family support (including your father) and no employment prospects. Yet your Mom somehow kept things together and kept you healthy and loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you and your Mom would have probably just scraped by if, on your fifth birthday, your Mom got a job as a maid for the Wilkinson family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greater Wilkinson family owned half of Newton County, and Darlene Wilkinson was the grand dame of Newton High Society. Her youngest daughter, like you mother, was a single mother with a daughter your age named Samantha Wilkerson<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, considering your respective socioeconomic positions, you and Samantha wouldn't have had anything to do with each other. She was the blue eyed redheaded favorite of the most powerful woman in your part of the state, You were a five year old Mexican-American girl who...well, the kindest words directed at you by some of the bigots around you was \"anchor baby.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's grandmother, though, had no problem with her granddaughter and you playing together while your mother worked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's grandmother was so impressed with your mother that she gave your mother starting capital to start her own cleaning service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom now owns the biggest cleaning service in the tri-county area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt age six, you and Samantha went to peewee cheerleading camp, where you met Donna Freeman and Masumi Abiko. And that was how the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pom Poms was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's what your collective mothers call your friendship. The name has sort of stuck, and some more rakish males will remark about how all four of you appear to have the same size \"pom poms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, granted, you and your friends are all approximately the same size, same weight and are definitely and equally blessed in the \"pom pom\" area, but there's no reason to go into that, is there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you, Samantha, Donna and Masumi have been friends since you were six. All of you made the cheerleading squad in your freshman year at high school, which was unheard of. One or two freshmen might make it on the squad, but most didn't get accepted until at least their sophomore year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but Samantha made captain her junior year, and you were here co-Captain your senior year. And both your junior and senior year, the squad made it to Nationals, winning the whole thing in your senior year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now you were going your separate ways. Well, not totally separate. You and Masumi were both going to MIT., Masumi for engineering and you for art..That was almost a given, that one of you would have to go with Masumi. She might appear to be vibrant and extroverted on the green, but in person, she was painfully shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was going to Rice, with ambitions of being a biomedical researcher, while Samantha was going to Yale to eventually get her MBA. This was due in part to the admiration she had for her grandmother, and her desire to emulate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou four would have the summer together, and would keep in touch all the time, but you would still be going off on different paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the four of you made a promise to spend as much time together as as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why you were at the Wilkerson summer cabin on Senior Prom weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously all four of you could have had dates, Except Masumi had a panic attack any time a guy asked her out. And since \"giving it up\" was considered a mandatory after Prom ritual (at least in the eyes of the guys), you and Samantha weren't planning  on going, Being the daughters of single mothers, both of you were all for taking it slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna had been dating someone regularly for the last six months, and had confided to the three of you that she planned to \"give it up,\" but her boyfriend had started being a real ass about the whole thing, and so she had cut him loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why the four of you were sitting around a firepit on a very secluded lake cabin under a star filled sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you think we should get a haircut?\" Donna said, lifting a strand of her hair to her eye. Donna's ethnic background was a mix of East African and the Indian subcontinent, with a splash of Polynesian mixed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe just the ends trimmed,\" you suggest, which gets a general nod from everyone around the fire. You've all kept your hair to just past the middle of your back for as long as you've known each other and, other than a little maintenance, had been fine with that for all that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasumi was about to make another S'more when she stopped. \"I keep on hearing about the Freshman Fifteen,\" she began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha pulled up her shirt to reveal a flat stomach. She patted it, adding, \"We're good right now. We'll just have to keep an eye on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small talk around the firepit continued until it is interrupted by<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>His name was Pakhal, a young male of the Alilal race. Like you, he had just recently graduated his race's version of high school. As is the tradition of his people, he went on a solo journey, though he took his in space. He hadn't meant to land on Earth, but a faulty energy source and a little panicking by a new pilot ended up with an emergency landing on Earth in the woods near the cabin you and your friends are staying in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you didn't learn this right away. But that was because your first reaction at seeing Pakhal was to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sitting at the fire, debating about making one more s'more for yourself before the four of you called it a night, when you happened to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the face of a giant calico cat looking back down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour natural reaction was to scream and point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you didn't expect was the owner of the giant cat face to scream in reply and disappear back into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally your three friends looked up to where you were pointing. The giant cat face had disappeared by the time they had looked up, but they heard the giant scream of fright, same as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of you could start exchanging information, a voice that sounded like the low rumble of distant thunder, with an inexplicable clipped British accent, called out from the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really friendly,\" the voice promised. \"I won't hurt you if you don't hurt me. Can I come out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the rest of your friends are absolutely stunned at the whole chain of events. But even more surprising is the fact that it's shy Masumi who calls it, \"We're friendly too. Come on out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when you get your first view of Pakhal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all practical purposes, Pakhal looks like a calico tabby cat that someone tried to turn into a human being. A giant human being. Pakhal looks to be at least sixty foot tall. And no tail. Which might be a good thing, considering what kind damage a swinging, twitching giant tale could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPakhal was wearing a form fitting blue bodysuit as he emerged from the woods. He was crouching, and you could tell he was trying to express through his body language that he was harmless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to the edge of the  light of the fire and knelt down. Masumi walked out to him as if talking with giant aliens was something she did every day. Maybe it's all the science fiction she reads and watches all the time. You don't know. But it''s Masumi who ends up taking the lead and getting everyone relaxed, both human and alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Pakhal begins telling the four of you all about life among the stars. There's sort of a loose confederation of races that accept general rules in dealing with each other, and keeping their hands off developing races like humans. Pakhal also tells you the Alilal are the only giant race among the space faring races, with everyone else being more or less human size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo things you notice when Pakhal is talking. First, all his teeth are flat. He might look like a feline, but he doesn't have a mouth full of sharp teeth like you would expect from a feline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis makes sense when you find out the Alilal are strictly herbivores. Well, they like fish too, but fish don't agree with their digestive systems. So no giant sushi for Pakhal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also notice Pakhal got very comfortable with Masumi very quickly. You, Donna and Samantha eventually relax enough in the surreal situation to talk to Pakhal, but he seems intensely shy with everyone except Masumi, You suspect that back on his planet, Masumi might be the giant male feline version of Masumi. Maybe that, combined with Masumi's love of Syfy, is the reason she and Pakhal are able to get along with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou learn that, as big as Pakhal's one man craft is (it's the size of a Boeing 757), the technology built into it let it land undetected. He asks if he can move it next to the cabin, and promises the technology will keep it hidden from sight or technology. Since the cabin belongs to Samantha's family, you and the other girls look to her to answer. She agrees to Pakhal's proposal, much to Masumi's delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's getting late, and Pakhal says it'll take about half an hour to move his craft. By mutual consent,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Okay, not open flirting, but the kind of flirting two shy people do when they like each other. It would be kind of cute, and you might even encourage it, and try to fade into the background, if it weren't for the fact that Pakhal is an alien who is almost twelve times as tall as the rest of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spaceship isn't quite invisible. It's sort of this shapeless, heat shimmer thing as it emerges from the water. Pakhal \"parks\" it by the cabin's deck, and then it truly does become invisible. Pakhal promises to give everyone a tour the following morning. Masumi is excited about the whole thing---you all are, but she especially is---but the promise of a tour tomorrow morning seems to mollify her.

Your father had abandoned you by driving off in his truck, while your mother had abandoned you by diving into a tequila bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were walking on the back side of your ranch, where it was mostly wooded, and considered just walking away from everything. Your mother was only worried about herself, why shouldn't you do the same? You could go into town, get a student grant, study at the community college for a couple of years and get an associate degree. Or maybe you could do something like join the Coast Guard. There were a lot of options to consider, rather than just hanging around a ranch that nobody else seemed interested in saving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these thoughts were running through your head when a streaking light shot through the sky in front of you. It was followed by a boom that literally knocked you on your ass,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got up, there was no sign of where that streaking light had landed/crashed. No sign of smoke rising from the distance, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you still have an idea of where it landed.
