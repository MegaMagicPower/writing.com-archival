The fact that he's bringing you with him while he's watching his neighbor's 5 dogs has you a bit nervous but you're glad to get the chance to see him show responsibility. Currently you're in his backpack next to some snacks and his gameboy listing to the muffled instructions Max needs to follow. But first what kind of you are you?</span></div></div>",

Your flimsy arms struggle with the zipper for a little while however you open it up wide enough for you to get out of your confines and into a living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you are outside of the bag you can see more of your surroundings. To your right you see what seems to be the entrance to a kitchen, you never learned much about food since you don't need to eat but you know the rooms purpose. Ahead of you you see a couch and chair, and behind them the stairs to the second floor and the basement. And finally to your left you see the large door / dog door to the backyard which you have seen from the window in Max's  room. also to your left you see AGh- you jump back in surprise as you notice that not too far from you is the neighbors Neapolitan Mastiff sleeping on a dog bed. It looked big when you saw it in their back yard but in person it's a mountain of muscle and joules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finish taking in your surroundings your years of listening for approaching people comes in handy. You hear that one of the dogs is about to come up from the basement, which means trouble. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Not to mention this is likely the safest place for you to be. And so you wait, you can't see much outside of the backpack other than backpack just couch and some carpet flooring. As you sit there waiting for max to return you also begin to hear the rhythmic breathing of what must be a massive dog sleeping off to your left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the calmness of your situation soon ends. You hear what sound like one of the dogs coming up from the basement and, to your horror, towards the backpack you're in. Next thing you know a wet nose is poking in through the hole you were looking through. A second later and what you can now see is the neighbors bull terrier has managed to get the backpack open and is sniffing around the bag, it seems to have taken either an interest in you or the snacks you are next to. You have a second to act, so what do you do?</span></div></div>",

That means that above all else you can't reveal the fact you can move to your human even if it means the end of the road for you. Whether you go above and beyond to help them in their tasks or focus on saving your inorganic skin is up to you (I guess if you want to get demoted to a chew-toy go crazy). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If you want to add chapters of your own go ahead, though I do ask you follow a few rules. First of all this is a choose your own adventure style interactive so you can only choose your own actions (and what kind of toy you are). Second of all this story has a 13+ rating, please stick to that. I genuinely hope this didn't need to be said but this website can get pretty weird. That is pretty much it, other than that have fun with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
