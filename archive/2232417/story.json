The two were emotional wrecks as they made their way into the hospital\u2019s parking garage.  Deanna, their 13-month-old daughter, had spent the last four days in the hospital after experiencing several seizures within a short amount of time.  This was the third such occurrence since Deanna had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer six months earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived at their car, Brian unlocked the doors so Gloria could place Deanna in her car seat.  As the two of them got in the car, Gloria looked at her husband and said, \u201cWhat are we going to do, Brian?\u201d barely holding it together, Gloria continued, \u201cThe news just keeps getting worse; and I don\u2019t want to lose our little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian and Gloria had been told the previous night that Deanna\u2019s increasing seizures meant that her condition was becoming worse.  Unless a miracle happened within the next few months, it was likely that Deanna wouldn\u2019t survive.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t throw the towel in just yet, Gloria; there are still some possible treatments that we can try.\u201d Patting his jacket pocket, Brian said, \u201cThe doctor gave me some information about some experimental treatments that she thinks could work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dare you accuse me of throwing in the towel.\u201d Staring at her husband, her emotions getting the better of her, Gloria yelled, <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare, for one second, think that I\u2019m giving up on saving Deanna\u2019s life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian came close to losing control himself; the stress of the last few days having gotten to him as well.  However, he managed to stay calm, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Gloria, I-I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d Sighing as he went to turn the car on, he continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve both been under a lot of pressure recently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria remained silent as Brian drove out of the parking garage; waiting a few minutes before responding.  \u201cI just wish there was something we could do; something we haven\u2019t thought of yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian and Gloria spent the 20-minute ride to their apartment complex in silence as they were both too emotionally drained to speak.  Pulling into their parking space Brian caught sight of their neighbors Chris and Maggie Johnson walking down the sidewalk with some groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian threw a half-hearted wave at them as he turned off the car; stepping out as they approached.  The Johnson's had moved into the complex a few weeks after the Sheppard\u2019s learned of Deanna\u2019s diagnosis; Chris was an Anthropology intern at a local museum while Maggie was a social worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria wasn\u2019t in the mood to chat, so she silently walked past with Deanna.  Maggie looked at Brian as he slowly approached them; the look on his face telling her everything she needed to know.  \u201cWhat did the doctors say, Brian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey said that Deanna\u2019s condition has progressed to where they can\u2019t do anything for her.\u201d Struggling to keep his composure, Brian continued, \u201cUnless a miracle happens, she\u2019s got maybe 2 months to live.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the five months they\u2019d known each other both Chris and Maggie had grown close to the Sheppard's; and neither of them like to see their friends so emotionally distraught.  As he placed a sympathetic hand on Brian\u2019s shoulder, Chris said, \u201cIf there\u2019s anything we can do to help, just let us know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve both already gone above and beyond; neither myself or Gloria can thank you for everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d Briefly covering his mouth with a hand, Brian said, \u201cIf anything else comes up, I\u2019ll be...we\u2019ll let you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them spoke for a few minutes until the cool temperatures finally got to them.  After saying their goodbyes Chris and Maggie watched Brian as he went upstairs to check on Gloria.  As they continued to their apartment, Chris turned to Maggie and saw that she was deep in thought.  \u201cIs something wrong, Maggie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging keys from her pocket, Maggie looked towards Chris and said, \u201cWe have to do something to help Brian and Gloria.\u201d Sighing as she opened the door to their apartment, Maggie continued, \u201cThey\u2019ve been nothing but kind to us since we arrived.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping inside the apartment, Chris shut the door and walked towards a strange cube-shaped device on a nearby counter.  There was an almost imperceptible hum from the device after Chris pressed a series of buttons.  Walking into the kitchen after his wife, Chris said, \u201cWhat you\u2019re suggesting would violate every rule in the book.\u201d Leaning up against the counter, Chris continued, <br>\r\n\u201cEven if that weren\u2019t true; I don\u2019t think Brian and Gloria can handle something of that magnitude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, Chris; I have faith that they\u2019re ready.\u201d Closing the fridge as she turned to her husband, Maggie said, \u201cBesides, what\u2019s the worst that could happen if they\u2019re not ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really need to ask that question?\u201d Looking at his wife, Chris continued, \u201cIf the government were to ever find out about us, they\u2019d lock us away and do experiments on us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve really got to stop watching those old sci-fi films.\u201d Taking a step towards the kitchen door, Maggie said, \u201cIn all our dealings with the Sheppard's, when have they ever acted like the humans in those movies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Chris knew better than to try and talk Maggie down; she was going to go through with whatever she was planning regardless of what he thought.   Following her, Chris said, \u201cI still don\u2019t think this is smart; but I\u2019ve never been able to talk you out of doing something you set your mind to.\u201d Standing at the door, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll get everything ready while you go invite them over for drinks or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour went by before Brian and Gloria decided to head across the hall to their neighbor\u2019s apartment.  After checking on Deanna for the 10th time in the 15 minutes, Gloria grabbed the baby monitor and went to meet Brian at the door.  \u201cI don\u2019t know if now is the right time for this, Brian.\u201d walking out into the hall, Gloria said, \u201cWe just got Deanna home, I think we need to spend time with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook it\u2019s not ideal, I know; but Chris and Maggie are our friends.\u201d Closing the door behind him, Brian said, \u201cThey\u2019re concerned about our well being, and rightly so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was because they were talking louder than normal, or perhaps he\u2019d been close to the door; but Chris had the door open before Brian could even knock.  \u201cHey guys, come on in and have a seat.\u201d Stepping to the side, he said, \u201cMaggie\u2019s just finishing up in the bedroom; she\u2019ll be right out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them walked into the apartment, Brian turned around in time to watch Chris close the door and head over to a small box situated on the counter.  He\u2019d seen it a couple times but never bothered to ask about it; until now that is.  \u201cHey Chris; what exactly is that cube thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even looking up from the device, Chris said, \u201cIt dampens noise within a preset area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously man, what is it?\u201d certain that Chris was messing with him, Brian said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys sit down.\u201d Walking past them, in a tone they\u2019d never heard him give before, Chris said, \u201cI promise everything will become clear soon enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian and Gloria exchanged worried looks as they started to sit down \u2013 wondering what they were getting themselves into.  They\u2019d never felt in danger around Chris or Maggie, but something was causing them to become worried for their safety.  \u201cWhat exactly is going on here, Chris?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris paced around the room for a moment as if he were deep in thought about something. After a few moments of silence, he turned towards the couch and said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t known each other for long.  But,\u201d with a heavy sigh, Chris continued, \u201cMaggie and I have come to see that you two are far more open minded then other members of your species.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian and Gloria gave each other confused looks as they had no idea what Chris was saying.  \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean, Chris?\u201d turning to her friend, Gloria said, \u201cAren\u2019t we the same species?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Gloria, we\u2019re not; but it\u2019ll be easier if we just showed you.\u201d Momentarily covering his mouth, Chris turned to the closed bedroom door and said, \u201cMaggie, you can come out now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian and Gloria focused all their attention on the door as they heard movement from the other side.  The door opened and they saw a strange figure, unlike anything they\u2019d ever seen before, step out of the bedroom.  Startled, Gloria clung tightly to Brian\u2019s arm as the figure slowly approached them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clearly female as they could see breasts underneath the outfit it was wearing.  But that\u2019s where the similarities ended; its skin was a blue-green color, its skull was elongated and, from what they could see, there were only 4 fingers on each of its hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a panic, Brian and Gloria sprang to their feet and ran to the door; screaming as loud as their lungs allowed.  Before they could even undo the first lock, the alien creature forced itself between them and the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf seeing a real live alien wasn\u2019t shocking enough for them; what happened next certainly was.  Looking at them, the creature said, \u201cCalm down guys, everything is going to be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was too much for Gloria to handle; she collapsed to the floor as Brian looked at the alien before him.  \u201cM-Maggie?\u201d</span></div></div>",

As they waited for her to regain consciousness, Maggie cautiously approached Brian.  \u201cWe figured you would be taken by surprise; but I didn\u2019t expect Gloria to have that sort of reaction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well it\u2019s not every day your neighbors reveal themselves to be aliens.\u201d Looking over Maggie\u2019s alien form, while trying to be as discrete as possible, Brian said, \u201cIt\u2019s strange; I can still tell that it\u2019s you in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on her best imitation of a model posing, Maggie said, \u201cOur disguises are what we\u2019d look like had we been born human.\u201d Looking at Brian, Maggie said, \u201cYours in the 3rd species I\u2019ve disguised myself as.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian was about to ask more about that when Gloria started to stir.  \u201cI had the strangest dream, babe.\u201d Slowly sitting up, Gloria said, \u201cChris and Maggie invited us over to for drinks; but Maggie turned out to be some...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria stopped as she became aware of her surroundings.  Everything was going well until she saw the blue humanoid standing next to Chris; both looking on in concern.  In stark contrast to just moments earlier, Gloria didn\u2019t have much of a reaction.  Cautiously approaching his wife, Brian said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream, honey; Chris and Maggie really are...aliens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re from a planet called Maltor Prime; about 25 lightyears from here.\u201d Maggie cautiously approached her friend so as not to spook her.  \u201cOur species discovered your world 150 years ago; we\u2019ve been sending fact-finding missions here ever since, studying your world and its inhabitants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian took a seat next to Gloria; although neither of them spoke a word.  Sensing their trepidation, Chris pointed towards the cube on the counter, \u201cYou can speak freely here; even the most dedicated busybody would have to enter the apartment to hear what we say here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian and Gloria exchanged looks; as the latter turned back towards Chris and Maggie.  \u201cWho...what are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs my wife said, we\u2019re Maltorians.\u201d Gesturing to Maggie as he spoke, Chris said, \u201cOur true names are Q\u2019uris and Ma\u2019gi D\u2019Pkeni.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian and Gloria took a moment to process what they were hearing.  Eventually, Brian said, \u201cWhy...why are you telling us this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe thought it wise to tell you the truth; so you\u2019d be more likely to believe what we\u2019re about to tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that we\u2019ve all become close friends since our arrival.\u201d Standing next to her husband, Ma\u2019gi said, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t bear to see the pain you two were experiencing; especially when we had the ability to do something about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria was starting to suspect where Ma\u2019gi was heading with this; but didn\u2019t want to get her hopes up.  \u201cWhat exactly are you saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have the means to cure Deanna\u2019s tumor; allowing her to grow up like any other child.\u201d Focusing on Gloria, Ma\u2019gi said, \u201cThat is; if you\u2019ll let us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria looked at her husband for a moment, seeing that he was also on the fence.  Swallowing, Gloria turned back her friends and said, \u201cCan we have a moment to discuss this...privately?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course; we\u2019ll withdraw to the bedroom.\u201d Taking his wife\u2019s hand, Q\u2019uris said, \u201cJust knock when you\u2019ve reached a decision.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian waited until the door was closed before getting to his feet.  Turning to his wife, he said, \u201cAre we really considering this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that we have much choice, Brian.\u201d Sighing, Gloria said, \u201cThey said they can heal Deanna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacing around the room for a moment, Brian said, \u201cLet\u2019s say, for a moment, that we go through with this.\u201d Looking towards Gloria, he said, \u201cThe doctors know what Deanna\u2019s prognosis is; how will we explain a tumor just disappearing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll figure it out; but frankly I don\u2019t care.\u201d Getting to her feet, Gloria said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been giving a chance to save our daughter\u2019s life; we\u2019d be fools not to take it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what if it doesn\u2019t work?\u201d getting nervous, Brian said, \u201cJust because it works on them is no guarantee it'll work on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou accused me earlier of giving up on our daughter; now I can\u2019t help but think that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Looking at her husband, \u201cOur best friends are offering to help us; and you want to turn them away because of how many fingers they have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Gloria put it that way, Brian couldn\u2019t help but feel two inches tall.  Gloria was right; they were nothing if not desperate, why wouldn\u2019t they jump at the promise of a cure.  With a sigh and a nod, Brian walked to the bedroom door and knocked.  Once Q\u2019uris opened the door, Brian said, \u201cWe\u2019ll do it.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Within minutes of announcing their decision, Brian and Gloria led Q\u2019uris and Ma\u2019gi across the hall to their apartment.  The timing couldn\u2019t have been better, because they found Deanna experiencing the beginning stages of a seizure.  Once it stopped, Q'uris injected Deanna with a syringe full of a dark blue liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he gently placed Deanna back in her crib, Q\u2019uris said, \u201cIt will take time before we know if the injection has done its job.\u201d<br>\r\nFollowing Q\u2019uris out of the bedroom, with Gloria beside him, Brian said, \u201cHow will we know if it worked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQ\u2019uris gestured towards Ma\u2019gi, who was waiting for the others in the living room.  As she held up a small device, Q\u2019uris explained, \u201cWhat she\u2019s holding functions much in the same way as the tricorder on Star Trek.\u201d Taking a seat next to his wife, Q\u2019uris said, \u201cWe\u2019ll check Deanna\u2019s condition every 20 minutes or so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian and Gloria both took seats across from their guests; with no one having any idea what to say.  After a few moments of awkward silence, Ma\u2019gi finally spoke up and said, \u201cI\u2019d imagine that you both have some questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one comment opened the floodgates as Brian and Gloria went ahead and bombarded their friends with endless questions.  Brian was more interested in the big picture; asking what Maltor Prime was like (geologically younger than Earth, but similar in size).  Gloria, for her part, asked generic questions.  Focusing her attention on Ma\u2019gi, she said, \u201cWhat was the hardest thing for you to adjust to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s easy; having hair.\u201d Gesturing to her bald scalp, Ma\u2019gi said, \u201cComing from a species with very little in the way of hair, I never realized how much of a hassle it would be; waking up with in in my face every morning, having to brush and clean it regularly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please.\u201d Chuckling, Q\u2019uris said, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember your first assignment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMa\u2019gi gave her husband a blank stare for a moment; before smacking her forehead with one hand, \u201cOh Chrestus, you\u2019re right; I forgot about that.\u201d Seeing the bemused looks on her friend\u2019s faces, she continued, \u201cFor my first assignment after training, I was sent to observe this primitive, tribalistic, race of ape-like creatures near what you call the Pleiades.  Apart from hunting and gathering, the big communal activity was picking nits off each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat topic of discussion continued for a few more minutes until Q\u2019uris went to check on Deanna.  Brian and Gloria were cautiously optimistic until they heard Q\u2019uris say, in a disturbing tone, \u201cGuys, you may want to come in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian and Gloria jumped to their feet; nearly colliding with each other as they ran into the bedroom.  As they approached Deanna\u2019s crib, they stopped in their tracks when they saw what had Q\u2019uris so concerned.  Deanna\u2019s skin had taken on a light shade of blue and was slowly getting darker.  If they looked close enough, Brian and Gloria would\u2019ve noticed both of Deanna\u2019s pinkies and little toes beginning to shrivel up.</span></div></div>",

She was on the verge of lashing out in anger as Ma\u2019gi rushed into the room.  Looking towards her friends, Gloria said, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to my baby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis was an unforeseen complication.\u201d Taking the scanner from Ma\u2019gi, Q\u2019uris slowly ran it over Deanna\u2019s body.  Looking up from the screen, he said, \u201cIt seems that Deanna is in the process of becoming a Maltorian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this deliberately, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Filled with rage, Brian grabbed Q\u2019uris by his shirt collar, \u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can assure you we had no idea this would happen; as far as we knew the treatment would only cure her condition.\u201d As he calmly removed Brian\u2019s hands, Q\u2019uris said, \u201cIf I had any untoward plans for your daughter, believe me when I say wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop me.  Even a Maltorian child has twice the strength of the stronger human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing around to stand next to her husband, Ma\u2019gi said, \u201cWe wanted to give you your daughter back; we wouldn\u2019t have suggested this if we thought this would happen.  To do what you suggest would be against Chrestus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria moved towards the crib and picked up Deanna; finding that some of her har was already falling out.  Holding her daughter in her arms, Gloria turned to Brian and said, \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour society isn\u2019t ready to know about our existence yet.\u201d Q'uris replied. \u201cAs much as it pains me to suggest this; the only way to keep her safe is for us to bring her to Maltor Prime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d his voice shaking, Brian said, \u201cThere has to be another way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve known me for months, Brian; but still you were ready to believe the worst about me.\u201d Gesturing to Deanna, Q\u2019uris said, \u201cHow do you think strangers would feel about Deanna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian said nothing. He only moved next to Gloria and touched his daughter's head, removing more of her hair.  Turning to Ma\u2019gi, Gloria said, \"How soon will her head look like yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat won\u2019t happen for many years, I\u2019m afraid; it\u2019s a function of puberty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian and Gloria looked at Deanna in silence; watching as her skin was almost identical to Ma\u2019gi.  Although they knew it would hurt, they both knew what they had to do.</span></div></div>",
