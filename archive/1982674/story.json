Yet his pursuers didn't want to kill him. Instead they wanted to capture him and experiment on him like an animal and also they would have to nullify his healing factor first in order to kill him anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with these people! I was minding my damn business and here these freaks come trying to capture me and any other superhero they come across.\" Logan grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet the group that Logan is trying to get away from is a fairly new group. They claim to be peaceful, but in reality their leader is building an army of clones and artificial humans. Rumors say that they already captured the real Iron Man and replaced him with a clone who thinks he's the <i>real</i> Iron Man. However, the rumors have been discredited by Tony Stark himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to find a place to lay low.\" Logan looks for any possible escape routes. \"That buffet sounds like a good place. They wouldn't dare trying to apprehend me there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Logan could get away a woman who's half Mexican and half Italian blocks his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think you're going handsome? My boss just want to have a word you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's body begin releasing toxins that enthralls whoever smells them into doing her bidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're that Inhuman that's been going around and brainwashing people to your...\" Before Wolverine could finish his sentence the scent of the invisible toxins reach his nose. The sweet aroma starts overwhelming the pleasure sensors in his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were saying what now big boy.\" The Inhuman said in a seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell nice.\" The enthralled Logan said as he began to thoroughly sniff the Inhuman, much to her twisted pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what my ten boyfriends tell me all the time, especially a certain playboy that I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This isn't right. She reminds of my degenerate son Daken.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Inhuman backs away as she realizes that Logan is fighting off her hypnotizing toxins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnn... No one controls the Wolverine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolverine then goes on a berserker rage and manages to cut the Inhuman. In response the Inhuman manages to heal herself by draining the lifeforce out of one of her thralls. Wolverine begins to calm down as his secondary mutation kicks in. Wolverine then takes off to the buffet in hopes of laying low and to fill his newfound hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drat! I can't believe my toxins wore off! No man breaks free of my control. Even if they are cured they will forever be addicted to Numora!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumora's communicator starts beeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be Dr. O'Hara. Apparently she wants me to retreat. Fine... I'll do as she wants for now, until I can find a way to make her one of my new devotees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of treason is against our contract. I hired you to capture one man and you couldn't even do that right.\" A harsh feminine voice sounded over the communicator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you gave me an actual team I could get the job done in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll discuss this later. The last thing we need is for S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers to find out our intentions. Head back to the lab pronto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes boss.\" Numora groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Logan, safely made it into the buffet and was enjoying the food he paid for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm finally away from that seductress. I can't stand being brainwashed like some puppet. At least that partially confirms what happen to Iron Man. Captains America and Marvel have been investigating New Beginnings Inc. for a while. I'll be sure to tell them of what just happened.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan's stomach growls loudly as if he hadn't eaten in days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>After I eat though. For some reason I'm hungrier than usual.</i></span></div></div>",

It also lowered his metabolism to the point that Logan would gain as many calories as he consumed. At first the customers ignored Logan, but as soon as he gained over 10 lbs. the customers and employees began to panic. The owner even contacted S.H.I.E.L.D. about the <i>growing</i> Wolverine problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this S.H.I.E.L.D.? We have a growing situation here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by growing?\" a stern woman replied to the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the Avengers seems to be eating me out of business and I believe he's eating me out of business.

He doesn't seem like he'll stop either. He's practically naked!\" The owner cried as he looked over his shoulder to see a fatter Wolverine trapped in a feeding frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on.

I've studied it in a book published by Dr. McCoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what going on, Agent Simmons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, but they usually occur when a mutant is in their 20s. I'll go call Dr. McCoy. I'm sure he can help us better understand the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go do that. Agent Coulson, Agent Quake, you two are coming with me. I already have Mac readying the Quinjet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda May, Daisy Johnson, and Phil Coulson board the Quinjet. Meanwhile Wolverine had managed to eat the whole buffet of its food. In all Wolverine gained 200 lbs. Logan now sported a double chin, fat and fleshy arms and legs, a wide rear end, and a massive stomach to top it all off. However, when Wolverine sensed their was no more food he awoke from the trance induced by his secondary mutation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in hell happened? One moment I was eating and then I blacked out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolverine then notices his sudden weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did I become so damn fat! I almost look like the Blob!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan looks around and sees the owner cowering in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got any clothes, bub? I sort of out grew the ones I was wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... I don't. Please don't hurt me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, bub. I'm not going to hurt ya. Can you explained what happened when I blacked out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... You don't remember? You literally ate through a day's worth of food for my buffet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan begins to blush out of embarrassment. Logan then sees his wallet on the ground and takes out whatever cash was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this. I'm awfully sorry for what happened. This was the first time this has ever happened. I'll be sure to pay ya back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buffet owner quickly snatches the cash out of Logan's pudgy hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should cover some of the costs, but you still owe me $10,000 for all the food you ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That shouldn't be a problem sir.\" Quake said as she entered the buffet with Agent Coulson and Director May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story. Can we just get the heck outta here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't have said it better myself. Let's get Logan onto the Quinjet and get some clothes on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Coulson don't share any your pictures on any fansite. This stays within the Avengers S.H.I.E.L.D. and  confidentiality agreement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those pictures last year were of a Christmas party last year. How was I supposed to know that Ms. Marvel would post the pictures all over the web on various blogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but maybe if a certain someone didn't try to play a practical joke Ms. Marvel wouldn't have gotten the pictures in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an April's fools day prank. Unfortunately arcade turned it into a weapon and Ms. Marvel disguised herself as Fitz.\" Quake responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not waste anymore time. I just got word from Fitz that more artificial humans are wreaking havoc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan follows the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents onto the Quinjet. From there he is given a special body suit designed by Fitz and Simmons that adapts to the wearer's size. A few hours later they arrive at S.H.I.E.L.D.'s HQ. They are immediately greeted by Fitz, Simmons, and Logan's fellow Avenger pal Hank McCoy aka Beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Logan, it's nice to see you. It's looks like you filled out quite nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hank, I don't know what's going on with me, but I just gained 200 lbs. or so within a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a secondary mutation. Agent Simmons made the right choice in calling me. If you could follow us to the lab and see why you've grown larger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Hank. The sooner I can lose this weight the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan's stomach growls in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like your stomach may disagree with you.\" Beast joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we just see why I'm going through this secondary mutation already? I really want to hit the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan follows Beast and FitzSimmons to the lab. Once in the lab.</span></div></div>",
