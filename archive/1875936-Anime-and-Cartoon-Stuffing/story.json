It was getting hot out, so he took off his jacket and his undershirt, then he put on a blue t-shirt with the symbol of Konoha in orange on it. He stayed in his orange pants, then, predictably, he set off for Ichiraku's, as he always did after a mission. The last few missions paid out quite a bit, so Naruto had plenty of money to spare. When he arrived at Ichiraku's he was greeted with a \"Hey! How's my favorite customer.\", to which he responded cheerily \"I'm great, and hungry! Give me a miso pork ramen with extra pork, old man.\" Teuchi then retreated to the kitchen, preparing Naruto's order. He knew that Naruto was a big eater, so while he was there, he got out more ingredients, and then he brought out a few large kettles in anticipation of Naruto's binge. Then he began cooking a few pots of ramen for Naruto. Soon, he was finished, and he got a bowl, taking a serving of miso pork for Naruto. He added all of the trimmings, including the extra pork, then he gave it to his daughter, Ayame, who brought it to Naruto. Naruto eagerly blurted out \"Thanks\", and he got a pair of chopsticks, splitting them, and preparing to dig in.</span></div></div>",

He turned around, eyes widening a bit at the sight before him. There, right in front of him, stood Kiba, arms folded and lips quirked in a good-natured smirk. The other boy, having had the day off, was clad in rather casual clothes appropriate for the weather; specifically, a pair of light-blue pants and a dark green, v-necked t-shirt with red lining the neck and a picture of a cartoony dog face on the chest. From atop his head, Akamaru stirred and barked a greeting at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Kiba. What's up?\" Naruto asked, turning around and fixing the dog-nin with a smirk of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown-haired boy shrugged. \"Eh, Hinata's trainin' with Neji and Shino's collectin' bugs, so me and Akamaaru figured we'd get a bite to eat.\" He indicated the seat next to Naruto. \"Which brings me back to my question: you mind if we sit here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked again. \"H-huh? Nah, I guess not.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Thanks, Naruto; you're a pal.\" Striding over to the seat, he plopped down and raised an arm. \"Oi! Can I get an extra-large ramen with beef?\" His eyes flicked towards the top of his head. \"And, uh, maybe get a small one for Akamaru, too.\" The dog yipped in thanks, tail wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeuchi blinked in confusion-only an Inuzuka would order for a dog-but he nonetheless turned around and began preparing Kiba's order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned and licked his lips as the smell of noodles, broth, and beef wafted into his sensitive nostrils, and he couldn't help drooling just a tiny bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" he muttered, not caring if Naruto, now slurping up his own noodles, heard him. \"This is gonna be so good...and this is only the first one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Naruto gulped down his current mouthful and looked over at his friend in confusion. \"Eh? First one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned. \"Yeah! I've got a ton of money saved up from missions, and I figured, since this is my day off, why not go wild?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at him, the stirrings of an idea beginning to stir. \"And...how many bowls were you planning on getting?\"<br>\r\nKiba laughed, patting his currently flat stomach. \"As many as I can cram in my gut.\" Akamaru rolled his eyes, but nonetheless kept quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked. \"That right?\" He patted his pocket. \"Well, I've saved up a ton of money, too, and I was planning on getting at least a few bowls.\" His smirk turned competitive. \"You up for an eating contest?\"<br>\r\n{/i}<br>\r\nKiba blinked, surprised. \"Eating contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned, patting his own flat stomach. \"Yep! I figure, we eat as many bowls as we can, and whoever loses has to pay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sneered. \"What, you think I'm paying for your stupid ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto bristled slightly at the insult, but his expression quickly turned cocky. \"What's the matter, Kiba? Afraid I'll kick your ass like I did during the Chunin Exams?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba narrowed his eyes, baring his teeth. Oh, it was ON. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! Old man!\" Kiba raised his arm. \"After you finish mine, keep on making 'em for both of us, and don't stop till we can't eat any more!\" Teuchi, blanching a bit at this, nonetheless went about his work, setting Kiba's first bowl in front of him, as well as a smaller one for Akamaru. Then, he went right back to work, preparing more bowls for the two boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba glared at  Naruto, split his chopsticks, and began digging into his bowl. Naruto, who only smirked, dug into what was left of his, even as Teuchi set another bowl down by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru cringed, even as he hopped down from Kiba's head and began working on his own bowl. This wasn't gonna end well, he knew it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you wanna go from here?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Teuchi saw where this was going. His most valued customer was very competitive, and he could down a surprising amount of ramen if he could. He had also served Kiba more than once, and he saw Kiba eat more than his fair share of ramen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was glad that he cooked the large pots of ramen in anticipation of Naruto's binge, as this would make his job much easier. He also got out the bowls for extra large ramen so that he would not have to do so many dishes when this was all said and done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyame decided to help by taking count of each of the boys' consumed bowls. She also took the finished bowls out of the way to be washed, adding to the count when she did so. This was part of a system that the father-daughter duo decided to employ. When one of the boys would finish, they would say their flavor for Teuchi, and Teuchi would take from the pot that he made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Naruto finished his bowl, and, as he liked to have fair fights, he waited for Kiba to finish his, which did not take long. Ayame took the empty bowls, while Naruto shouted, \"Another miso pork please!\" Kiba followed suit, simply adding, \"Me, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto got a bit miffed by this, and he yelled at Kiba, saying, \"Make your own order!\" Kiba retorted with, \"It doesn't matter! You're paying for it anyway!\" Naruto was about to start arguing with Kiba some more, but the boys already had their ramen in the extra large bowls sitting right in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them wasted time bickering as they dug in, slurping violently in an effort to get ahead of their adversary. Both of them had a large amount of confidence, as they both have eaten a lot in the past, and they both loved Ichiraku ramen, though Naruto loved it even more than Kiba, opting to go there much more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Akamaru had finished his bowl, as he was eating more casually, and he was satisfied with one bowl, so he climbed onto the seat next to Kiba, and observed the competition. Ayame saw this, and while she still had time, she placed a pillow on the counter, and prompted Akamaru to climb up. Akamaru was well-trusted at Ichiraku's and he was as welcome as the other two. Ayame gave Akamaru a pat on the head, then watched as Naruto and Kiba got closer to finishing their first bowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, the two had finished slurping their broth almost simultaneously, and Ayame took the bowls, bringing the count for each of them up to two. Both boys were considerably hungry before coming to Ichiraku's, so they were still a bit hungry when they finished these two bowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was still in the mood for pork, so \"Keep the pork comin'!\" was his instant response to finishing. Kiba, on the other hand, stopped caring about flavor, so he just said \"Surprise me, old man!\" Kiba then petted his beloved pet and friend while he waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short time, the two had their bowls, and they started slurping down their ramen with even more gusto. Akamaru was relaxing on the pillow in the afternoon sun, and he watched as the two finished their noodles in less than about a minute, and they greedily slurped down the broth in seconds. Luckily the ramen was not too hot, so this was not too difficult for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeuchi knew what the two would order, so as soon as they finished, he handed them the next two bowls. Yet another pork for Naruto, and a chicken for Kiba. Ayame took the empty bowls, making the count for both of them 3, and this process continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru was interested, so he continued to observe the contest, watching as the fourth bowl filled the boys' stomachs enough to make it slightly noticeable had they not been wearing shirts. Soon they finished their next bowls, and they were finally not hungry anymore, but they certainly were not full, especially since they were eating so fast that the fullness would not hit them for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Naruto had three more bowls of pork ramen. It was quite a streak for him. Kiba, on the other hand, had two bowls of shrimp, and another bowl of beef ramen. At this point, their stomachs were distended enough to become quite noticable, even under Naruto's blue t-shirt and Kiba's doggy shirt. Noticing this, Akamaru thought to himself, \"I haven't seen Kiba eat this much in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the count climbed to ten, with Naruto <b>still</b> eating pork ramen, and Kiba having virtually every flavor. At this point, their shirts had begun rising up, and a sliver of flesh slowly began to reveal itself to the world. Their engorged bellies were beginning to work their way further under the counter and they were starting to cause strain their pants buttons. Akamaru had begun to worry at this point, but he knew that there was no stopping them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree more bowls later, Naruto continued to eat pork ramen, and he polished off a large pot singlehandedly. In fact, he had established a small lead. Kiba, meanwhile, was now eating exclusively beef ramen, as Teuchi knew that it was Kiba's favorite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, their bellies were big enough to lift their shirts to reveal an inch of engorged belly flesh, and their waistbands began to cut into their growing stomachs that yearned for more room. They were also sitting right up to the counter-top, so their bellies were getting awfully close to the cabinets underneath.</span></div></div>",

At this point, he also noticed his stomach was getting close to the table. He winced. \"Eesh, better scoot back a bit...\" This in mind, he backed up on his stool a bit, creating some distance between his growing gut and the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, meanwhile, seemed to have realized the same thing. Scooting back, he reached under his  stomach and felt the front of his pants, blushing a bit. \"Oh wow, these are really tight, aren't they?\" he murmured to himself, reaching for his button. Better he do something about it now than let his sister try to mend a popped button...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, having the same idea, reached for his button as well. Though his belly did get in the way a bit, he finally got a good enough grip on both the fabric and the button to hold them firm. Coincidentally, at the same time, Kiba got a firm grip on his button as well. In an eerily synchronized move, both boys unbuttoned their pants, sighing in relief at the release of pressure. As a result, their stomachs bulged out a tiny bit, their shirts rising up a little higher and exposing a little more skin, with the first few teeth of their respective flies coming open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed again, smiling blissfully. \"Oh man, that feels so much better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, for once not seeing fit to argue, merely rubbed his stomach and grinned. However, when he saw Teuchi and Ayame staring at him and Naruto, he scowled. \"Hey, we ain't done yet! Keep the ramen coming!\" Starting, the father-daughter pair went about preparing more ramen, even as Kiba and Naruto attacked their current bowls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Akamaru stared at the two boys, finding himself fascinated despite himself. This was the first time he'd ever seen Kiba eat this much, and though he didn't want to admit it, he found himself eager to find what they'd both look like by the time they were done. He settled back into his pillow wagging his tail. This was going to be interesting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you want to go from here?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The boys were back in the fray, and they continued to devour more and more bowls of ramen. Akamaru watched, amazed, as the two were still able to eat with such gusto. The violent slurping sounds were almost memorizing, and Akamaru was amazed that Teuchi and Ayame could catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each passing bowl, the flies of the boys were forced down slightly farther, and their shirts had risen slightly higher.. In only about five minutes, the two had reached 17 bowls, and their flies had reached the bottom, though their bellies were obscuring their exposed undergarments for the moment. Either way, their shirts had also risen to the point where their belly buttons were slightly exposed. \"Huh, Naruto's an innie, too,\" thought Kiba as he gulped down yet another bowl of broth, setting the empty bowl on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was determined to stay on his pork ramen, getting closer to finishing another pot, and Teuchi kept giving Kiba beef ramen so that he would finish the pot of beef ramen off. Either way, the two did not care what flavors they ate, as they were so determined to beat each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few more minutes, Kiba had reached 20 bowls, but Naruto was already working on his 22nd, not to mention his third pot of pork ramen. Kiba polished off the pot of beef ramen, so Teuchi was giving him chicken ramen now. Either way, Naruto's stomach was large enough to lift his shirt several inches above his belly button, and Kiba's had also risen, though not as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were so full of ramen that any movement caused they boys' bellies to wobble. They, especially Kiba, were staring to feel quite full, and their bellies were stretched considerably, but they were both too determined to beat each other to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru watched in awe as the number climbed up to an astonishing 24 for both of them. Kiba was able to speed up, and finally caught up. Either way, with each passing bowl, their stomachs pushed back under the counter, inching out ever so slightly as another bowl was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this bowl, though, their stomachs were so stretched out that both Kiba and Naruto's belly buttons were quivering due to the pressure. They finally inverted, providing a little more room, and though the two were initially fascinated, they glared at each other for a moment before digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru was worried for Kiba, as he began picking up speed. Now he was at 28, even though Naruto was only at 27. His outrageous stomach was so large that it wedged itself under the counter again, even though he scooted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Kiba, he was going too fast, and his fullness hit him like a brick. He slowed down suddenly, reluctantly drinking the broth of his 29th bowl down. He laid back, hoping that Naruto had given up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Naruto, this was his chance, so he continued to eat with gusto, ignoring the pain as much as possible, and soon, he was on his thirtieth bowl. He ate it like he normally would, and soon enough, he had finished that thirtieth bowl. Kiba saw this, and he initially griped, but, he lost fairly, so he grudgingly got out his wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet!\" Naruto exclaimed, then, in a gutsy move, Naruto demanded, \"Hey! Old man! Give me the rest of that pot of pork ramen!\" Kiba looked with both awe and disgust as Teuchi brought out a large pot of pork ramen. Though there was only about three bowls left, Naruto grabbed the pot, then put his mouth up to it, drinking down the rest of the ramen, noodles and all. He had to chew occasionally, but he slurped down the entire rest of the pot, leaving Kiba with even more to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You didn't have to show off like that!\" Kiba griped again, but he still got out his money and paid the tab. He wasn't kidding when he said that he had a lot of money, though, as the massive tab hadn't even taken out a quarter of his earnings. \"Guess it's time to go.\" Kiba pointed out, \"But don't think that you'll win next time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then scooted back, and his gargantuan stomach flopped out from under the counter. He leaned back, and at that point, Naruto caught a glimpse of Kiba's blue boxers with doggie bones on it. Naruto couldn't help but laugh hysterically. \"Look at Kiba's puppy underwear!\" he teased, before he tried to scoot out. He had eaten so much, however, that his stomach was wedged under the counter quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a lot of force, but Naruto's belly was finally released with a plop. At that time, however, Naruto lost his balance, falling backwards. His pants caught onto the counter, and they fell to his ankles, revealing a pair of tight-fitting white briefs, dotted with a design of a bowl of ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Kiba got the last laugh, in hysterics before managing to comment, \"You're one to talk, Naruto! At least I don't wear whitie-tighties with ramen on them!\" Kiba still lost and paid, but this was well worth it for him. Even Akamaru couldn't help but laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Naruto's face flashed a bright red, but, not one to stay embarrassed, he shrugged it off, saying \"At least I got a good meal for free!\" as he gestured by heartily patting his belly. \"I hate to admit it, but that was impressive\" was Kiba's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Naruto managed to stand up, but had to use the stool for support until he was able to balance himself. At that point, he pulled his pants up, trying to zip them up in futility. Kiba got up as well, and nearly fell over, but he managed to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeuchi just watched in confusion as Naruto and Kiba were being very friendly again, high fiving, and doing other 12-year-old boy gestures. Soon, Naruto exclaimed, \"See you later Kiba!\" before he slowly waddled away, his overfilled beach ball-sized belly wobbling with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's belly was not quite as big, but it was still difficult for him to walk as well. Either way, Akamaru opted to hop onto Kiba's head, and he fell asleep, enjoying the rocking motion of Kiba's waddling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon each adolescent shinobi was back in their respective homes, and Kiba was luckily home alone. Either way, both Naruto and Kiba collapsed on their respective beds, falling into an afternoon slumber almost instantly. As they breathed, their bellies rose and sank hypnotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Kiba's room, Akamaru opted to jump on top of Kiba's belly, where he curled up and fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

Hey, I'm not the idiot who challenged someone else on their home turf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba growled at the reminder, but Akamaru simply wagged his tail, remembering what a comfy pillow Kiba's engorged belly had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a few weeks since Naruto and Kiba's first eat-off at Ichiraku's. Though Kiba had taken his 'defeat' in good spirits, he was more determined than ever to beat the blonde. And, as he'd laid awake in bed, his belly churning as it digested the massive quantities of ramen it had taken (it had only taken the boys a day or two to digest everything, leaving them as slim as ever), he'd figured he'd do what Naruto did and hold an eating challenge that would work in his advantage: specifically, a burger place he liked to go to every now and then. Kiba loved meat, and he figured that he had the homefield advantage in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was about to retort to Naruto's remark, but was interrupted by a waiter, who set down their first plates: specifically, a large cheeseburger each with two patties and all the fixings. Naruto smirked, confident that this would go the same way as last time...until he saw the waiter set down a plate for Akamaru. \"Huh? Kiba, what's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog-nin laughed. \"Well, Akamaru got pretty interested in our eating contest last time, so he figured he'd try it for himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru yipped, wagging his tail. <i>Hey, I might end up looking like a fluffy soccer ball by the time I'm done, but at least I'll have fun doing it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gaped, but shook his head. \"Yeah, well, even if you have your dog helping you, don't think this time's gonna be any different! You're still goin' down!\" With that, Naruto seized his burger, lifted it to his mouth, and started tearing into it. Kiba, smirking did the same with his own burger, Akamaru jumping onto his not long after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you want to go from here?</span></div></div>",

This was harder than he though. Of course, being as small as he is, it was no wonder that Akamaru was already stuffed. Either way, he lied down under the table, nearly falling asleep with the fast, sloppy munching of the two being heard above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the top, Naruto and Kiba had reached their third large burger, which was almost the size of their heads. Kiba was a regular here, so all the servers knew that he loved his burgers very rare. They were so rare, in fact, that a bit of blood trickled down Kiba's chin as he ate, in addition to the restaurant's secret sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was a bit grossed out by Kiba's extremely rare burger, but he still focused on pigging out more than Kiba could, determined to show Kiba that he was still the best at eating. He was not used to eating burgers fast like Kiba, so he was considerably sloppier, spilling quite a bit of the burger contents on his chest. He did not care, though, as he was in the zone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, both boys' stomach quickly last their flatness, becoming slightly distended under their respective jackets, though not nearly enough to be noticeable. The waiter walked by to check on the two, who were finished with their next burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another one?\" questioned the waiter who was surprised by the sheer volume that the boys were eating. \"Kiba hasn't eaten that much in a while!\" thought the waiter. Little did he know that the two had neglected to eat breakfast to try to gain an advantage. He looked down at Akamaru, who was asleep under the booth with quite the stomach on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the waiter asked the question a second time, Kiba, who had been spacing out for a second, responded quickly with \"Of course, we're hungry here! Oh, and bring another for Akamaru, in case he gets hungry again!\" He was a bit embarrassed that he, a famous shinobi in the making, had neglected to be more observant. The waiter merely shrugged it off and walked back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, on the other hand, was mindlessly rubbing his belly with a goofy smile on his face. \"Man, Kiba, I never knew this place was so good!\" Naruto said, with Kiba's response being, \"What, are you done already! I already ordered for you, so I guess I'll have to eat it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this as a challenge, Naruto yelled back, \"You wish! I'm not even close to full!\" Kiba responded with, \"We'll have to see about that!\" The boys continued their banter, waking up Akamaru. \"Of course this is how they wait for their food\" Akamaru thought \"I hope they brought me another burger. I still have some room\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba and Naruto were so engrossed in their banter, they did not notice the waiter's approach, nor the fact that he was struggling with something. However, Akamaru, lying on the floor, happened to glance up...and his eyes went wide. <i>Oh, you gotta be kidding me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, oblivious to Akamaru's shock, merely raised a fist, ready to deliver a particularly obnoxious retort to Kiba's own banter, when, without warning, something huge dropped onto their booth's table with a loud THUNK that shook it, startling the blonde. \"Wh-what the hell!\" Not looking at the table, he glared up at the nearby waiter. Kiba, also startled by the distraction, looked at the table instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde raised his fist at the waiter. \"Hey, buddy, what do ya think you're doing? Unless you're bringing us the next course, how about showing some respect and...what the hell are you pointing at?\" In spite of his confusion, he nonetheless followed the waiter's pointing finger to the table...and his expression swiftly flowed into one that mirrored Kiba's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, sitting in front of them, was quite possibly the single biggest, most gargantuan burger either of them had ever seen: it easily encompassed most of the table, and it lacked any and all fixings, with the exception of several huge slices of cheese piled on the table-sized patty. It dripped with massive quantities of different sauces: ketchup, mustard, the restaurant's secret sauce, and ridiculous amounts of juice. All of this was contained within two gigantic buns, easily reaching an inch or two away from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost for words, Naruto and Kiba simply gaped at the waiter, who coughed. \"Well, erm, it looked like you two were competing, so I figured I'd give you both the single biggest thing this place had. That way, you could have your contest, and we wouldn't run out of supplies.\" He laughed nervously, while the boys simply returned their gaze to the burger on the table.   \"I'll, uh, let you get on with your competition.\" With that, the waiter hastily exited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Kiba or Naruto moved for a few minutes. The only movement Kiba made was to pick Akamaru up off the floor, stuffed belly and all, and place him on the table so he could get a better look at the massive sandwich. Then, the two boys exchanged a look, grinned, and attacked the burger with gusto. Even Akamaru, stuffed as he was, couldn't resist digging in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Naruto tackled the burger, grabbing large handfuls of meat, bun, and cheese (the meat was extremely tender, and the cheese and bun fresh-made, so this was a fairly easy task) and shoveling them into their mouths, heedless of the juices that dripped down their faces. Akamaru, in the meantime, simply grabbed whatever was within reach, whether it was meat, cheese, bun, or any combination thereof. As his belly was already stuffed, every bite, every mouthful caused his stomach to bulge just a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just Akamaru, either; as the minutes ticked by and more and more and more of the burger vanished down the boys' throats, Naruto and Kiba's stomachs were becoming visibly affected. Naruto's stomach slowly became a round shape clearly visible beneath his orange jacket, while the front of Kiba's black hoodie slowly pushed out. And, as the three continued attacking the monstrous sandwich, their bellies only continue to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's stomach went past simply being a round shape and pushed outwards, stretching his jacket in the process. Eventually, a few of the teeth of his orange jacket were pried apart by the slowly-growing mass, exposing a bit of the black shirt underneath. As his stomach continued to push out, more and more teeth were slowly pried apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba shoveled more and more into his mouth, his stomach swelled, pushing his black hoodie out further and further until, finally, it couldn't stretch anymore. Now, instead of pushing out as he gorged himself, the hoodie slowly began rising up, exposing a thin strip of skin that continued to grow as his stomach did, slowly pushing his hoodie up further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's stomach, meanwhile, grew and grew with every bite, until, finally, he could feel it begin to touch the table's surface, and his back legs begin to be forced apart. He whimpered slightly at the discomfort, but the taste of the burger pulled him back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the three of them continued to tackle the burger, their stomachs slowly but constantly swelling as more and more of their burger entered their gullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you want to go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were both rubbing their bellies with satisfied grins on their faces. The burger was quite destroyed, with Naruto Kiba and Akamaru having made two gigantic holes in its sides. The holes were so big that they nearly touching, leaving two halves of a burger with a small bridge connecting them in the middle. Due to the contribution of Akamaru, Kiba's hole was a just a little bit larger than Naruto's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that burger was soooo good!\" Naruto said, patting his stuffed belly for emphasis. After Naruto's belly had forced the bottom of his jacket open, Naruto removed the offending article of clothing, which had received quite a spattering of stains, leaving him in his black undershirt, which had ridden well above his navel. After struggling awkwardly for a while, he removed the button of his pants, causing his bloated belly to bulge out even farther, forcing his fly down, leaving him in his current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it! That's why I go to this place a lot!\" Kiba responded simply, patting his belly as well. His overfilled stomach had pushed his hoodie up so far that it currently rested on the top of his belly. When the two took a break, he had followed suit in unbuttoning his pants, causing his own belly to surge out to where it currently resided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the booths were large, leaving plenty of space in the seats, both Naruto and Kiba were dangerously close to touching the table. In fact, their leaning back was the only thing keeping them from touching the table with their bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru merely yipped in agreement, causing him to bounce on his belly. Taking after his master and best friend, Akamaru had eaten so much burger that his stomach had literally lifted him off of the ground a bit. In taking his break, Kiba was rubbing that massive belly, and his little buddy was close to falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, the three enjoyed their relaxation, nearly forgetting that they were in competition, but, when Naruto began showing off the size of his stomach, he prompted another round of banter, followed by the simultaneous digging in of Kiba and Naruto. Akamaru was extremely full, so he decided to sit out this round, watching as the two began to stuff themselves sillier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were back in the fray, sauces and meat juices hitting their faces and chests as they ate. They didn't care, as the burger was so delicious and surprisingly still hot. Because both boys had sat up in the process, their bellies were pressed against the counter, advancing farther out in all directions with each passing bite. </span></div></div>",

Naruto, never one to pass up a challenge (and besides, he could always use more cash) had eagerly asked Tsunade to sign him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this was more of a fun trip than a mission, Naruto had opted to dress casually for the occasion: specifically, he wore a pair of black trousers and a short-sleeved, white T-shirt that had Konoha's emblem emblazoned on both the front and the sleeves. He'd had clothes just like them when he'd been little, and he had always liked them, so it had been a simple choice for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. <i>Hope these duds are up to the task, 'cause my gut's gonna get awful big...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething suddenly drew his attention, and he sat up in his seat as the contest's referee called the attention of every contestant. Coughing, he began relaying the rules, which, basically, stated that there was to be no interfering with other contestants' meals, that there was no time limit, and above all, that if any of them were to lose their lunch (ick,) they would be automatically disqualified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grimaced at this, but nonetheless grinned as an extra-large ramen bowl was set before. Grabbing his chopsticks and splitting them apart, he held them above his bowl as the officiant held his hand up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready...set...GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Naruto and every other contestant set to their bowls with a will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens from here?</span></div></div>",

The ramen was also very good, and that helped Naruto considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, he practically chugged the broth, taking monstrous gulps of the savory, luscious liquid. It was easy to tell that the bowl was huge, though, as just one had formed a mound of flesh where his flat stomach used to be. It was large enough to form a light outline on his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe volunteer was very surprised, but he increased the number on the counter nonetheless, grabbing another bowl for Naruto, who dug in without missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tore into the bowl with just as much vigor, slurping down even more noodles, with each chopstick of noodles making his swollen belly create a bit more stress on his shirt. By the time he had finished this bowl, the shirt gave up, so it rose up, revealing a small strip of Naruto's overfilled stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe volunteer was more prepared this time, as he already had Naruto's next bowl waiting. Naruto continued on that bowl without even slowing down. He was definitely in the zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther contestants who had given up who were four times Naruto's size watched in awe as such a little twelve year old ate almost grotesquely fast. They were very impressed and they began to crowd around him, cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was downing the broth by that time, and this next bowl of ramen lifted his shirt up to where his navel was. By this point, his stomach was now causing stress to his pants, particularly the button that was holding them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheering only made encouraged Naruto more as he dug in with more gusto, his stomach pushing out farther and farther, looking for anywhere to expand out to. He finished the next gigantic bowl in no time, and his shirt had ridden up to the top of his overfilled belly, where it currently rested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, his pants button was constricting his belly and causing a considerable amount of pain, but he brushed it off as he grabbed the next bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate this one just as quickly, and soon, his quivering pants button could take no more, so it gave out, ricocheting on a chair in front of him and landing just shy of another contestant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it felt considerably better, Naruto was completely unaffected by this, and the surge forward in his belly that it had created. If anything, it only caused him to go faster as the ever-growing crowd cheered even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's belly had surged all the way to the table, where it began to be split in half by the encroaching table. Either way, he moved onto his sixth gigantic bowl, and at that point, there was only one other contestant left, and he was behind Naruto by an entire bowl.</span></div></div>",

Predictably, it had swollen even more; it pressed very uncomfortably against the table, the top half of his belly resting on the flat surface, his inverted navel wobbling in the middle for all to see. Even the bottom seams of the sides of his ill-fitting shirt had busted, creating more strain on the ones above them. His fly, having long come wide open, caused him to shiver as a draft played across the area, and he was, quietly, very grateful that no one could see his undergarments-currently, a pair of orange boxers with frogs on them. Grunting a bit, he scooted back, relaxing the pressure on his stomach. Sighing happily, he closed his eyes and let one arm hang to his side, the other one caressing the swollen mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, this arm was seized and lifted into the air. Alarmed, Naruto's eyes flew open and he looked in the direction of the disturbance, only to see the announcer holding his arm in the air. \"It's no contest! Uzumaki Naruto wins by three bowls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Naruto beamed. He'd won!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer continued. \"He will receive a sizable cash prize, and a weekend at the village's premiere hotel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto burped, still grinning goofily. A lotta cash AND a weekend at a nice hotel, which probably had an awesome buffet to boot! Awesome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and he will be sharing it with the winner of our nearby steak-eating competition, Inuzuka Kiba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened. <i>What?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if on cue, two attendants entered the scene carrying a very stuffed and satisfied Kiba, his arms draped around their necks for support. His long-sleeved, tan shirt had ridden up, and his clothes and belly were in much the same state as Naruto's. Behind them, Akamaru trotted along dutifully, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping, Kiba looked up at Naruto, smirking. \"Hey, Naruto; you won your contest too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock passing, Naruto grinned, smacking his engorged belly and causing it to shake. \"Heh, you bet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued bantering, Akamaru whimpered, sitting down. <i>I have a really bad feeling about this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you wanna go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was walking with Kiba towards his room with a soft, white hotel robe on, folding his arms behind his head. Since the contest yesterday, his stomach went back down to its normal state, the ramen having digested. There was a small bit of pudge on Naruto's midsection at the time, but by now, Naruto's high metabolism reduced it back down to being completely flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it! It feels awesome to relax every once in a while!\" The dog-nin replied, clad in a matching robe with his hands in the pokets of the robe. Akamaru even barked in agreement. \"I'm surprised that they haven't stuffed themselves yet!\" Akamaru thought. \"Of course, it's only Friday night, so it's bound to happen. Kiba's stomach was back to normal as well, as his morning run with Akamaru had helped him work off the small amount of fat that accumulated on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, the two relaxing young shinobi made their way to their room on the top floor. It was a lavish suite with all of the best accommodations. There were two soft, white king-sized beds, a large bathroom with marble floors and counters, and even a small porch-like area outside with a view of the surrounding area. They could even see Konoha from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two entered the room, amazed at the cleanliness and the fanciness. Kiba practically melted as he sat on the bed, being consumed by comfort. It wasn't long, however, before Naruto's stomach growled loudly while he sat on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look's like someone's hungry!\" Kiba said before his stomach protested in hunger. Taking the cue, Naruto asked, \"Wanna order room service?\" \"You don't have to ask me twice!\" Kiba responded eagerly, his stomach growling loudly to confirm it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto made his way to the hotel phone, Akamaru thought \"Oh, no. Here it comes.\" He watched as Naruto began ordering, \"I'll take three of your biggest bowls of ramen. One beef, one chicken, and one barbecue pork. I'll also take...\" Naruto continued ordering a massive order, which included nearly everything on the menu, focusing on ramen, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad the contests are paying for everything\" Akamaru barked at Kiba, who nodded in agreement. Naruto then finished, then handed the phone to Kiba. \"Wait, that's just Naruto's order!\" Akamaru thought as Kiba took the phone eagerly, beginning his order. \"Five of your biggest steaks, extra rare, with extra sauce, and...\" Kiba's order what just as large as Naruto's. He even ordered a steak for Akamaru!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they were done, the two laid back in their beds, turning on the massive TV to entertain themselves while they waited for their food. They chatted casually, and Akamaru was surprised that they hadn't bickered more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, there was a knock on the door, and Kiba leaped up off of his bed, eager to begin his feast. As soon as he did so, a virtual army of hotel chefs walked in, bringing with them eight carts that were overflowing with various food items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chefs arranged four of the carts around Naruto's bed, with the other four surrounding Kiba's bed. There was even a chef holding a dish with a cover. He went over to where Akamaru was laying, presenting him with his own small steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two spent nearly a minute just staring at the food, wide-eyed. It was all they could do to keep from drooling. Either way, as if on cue, Naruto and Kiba dug in simultaneously, with Naruto choosing a massive bowl of ramen that was the size of a large mixing bowl. \"Wow! When they say biggest, they really mean biggest!\" Naruto exclaimed halfway in between mouthfuls of noodle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! My steaks are immense!\" Kiba nearly screamed as he dug through the monstrosity, which itself took up a whole platter. He didn't even bother with utensils as he grabbed the edge and tore into it with the help of his Inuzuka canine teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru couldn't help but stare as the boys ate as if they hadn't in years, amazed by the sheer portions that were brought to them. He was amazed as Kiba and Naruto worked their way to the end of their respective dishes <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bellies, which were now able to accommodate even more due to recent stuffing, had already begun protruding out slightly, becoming just a bit visible under their hotel robes, which were surprisingly clean for the most part.</span></div></div>",

Their bellies now protruded a bit more than before, pressing rather visibly against their hotel robes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, that was good,\" Naruto murmured, patting his belly. \"That might have even been better than Ichiraku's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba licked the juice off his lips. \"Yeah; my steak was really tender!\" He looked at the massive amounts of food still left. \"Man, what should I have next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, meanwhile, was looking at his huge order, trying to decide what to have next. Eventually, he settled on another huge bowl of ramen, while Kiba targeted another massive steak. Setting their meals before them, Kiba and Naruto grinned at one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Kiba,\" Naruto began, splitting his chopsticks. \"How big ya think our guts are gonna be after we're done all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned, picking up his steak. \"Dunno,\" he replied, licking his lips, \"but I know one thing: it's gonna be awesome gettin' 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed, patting his midsection. \"Don't I know it!\" He smirked mischievously. \"I'm gonna see if I can break my sash!\" He tugged on the sash holding his robe together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's face lit up. \"That'd feel awesome! I broke my button during that steak competition, and it felt great!\" He rested his hands on his stomach. \"Imagine how awesome ripping this thing would feel!\" Suddenly hearing Akamaru whimper, he turned to his buddy, who was looking at them both, whimpering and tilting his head. \"Relax, buddy! We're wearin' undies under these!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, excited at the prospect of ripping his sash, dove into his ramen, slurping it up and causing his stomach to slowly grow as the noodles entered it. Kiba, likewise, began tearing at his steak, his belly bulging bit by bit as each piece of meat fell into his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you wanna go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon, their stomachs were stretching the fabric, in addition to causing quite a bit of strain on their sashes, which were currently creating dents in their stuffed bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Kiba finished his second steak, and Naruto had finished his second bowl of ramen. From there, Kiba moved on to a large platter that contained a massive pile of various sausages. After all, Kiba ordered mostly meat, in fact, it was hard to find anything but meat on his carts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's cart, on the other hand, was slightly more balanced, but, he was determined to finish all of the ramen, so he took a third bowl of ramen and began slurping vigorously, as he was also determined to break the sash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru watched, amazed at the focus of the two. They were completely oblivious to the juices running down their faces, with Kiba having sausage grease all over his face, and Naruto having broth dribbling down his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each bite, Akamaru could practically hear the sashes stretch more. Soon, Naruto was guzzling the broth of his ramen, biding through the pain of the sash on his stomach. This sudden surge of liquid was enough to cause his sash to violently tear with a very loud sound that even caught Kiba's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing freed from its prison, Naruto's abdomen surged forward powerfully. It surged forward with so much force, in fact, that it pushed out past Naruto's knees, then receded back, and it continued to wobble in that manner until it stopped, resting on Naruto's thighs and covering his undies, which were the same ones he wore when he first competed with Kiba at Ichiraku's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto discarded the loose robe, throwing it towards the closet, he rubbed his massive, stuffed belly, saying, \"Man, that felt good! Now I can fit even more in here!\" He then slapped his belly proudly, adding, \"Kiba, you should try it!\", which caused Kiba to stop staring at Naruto, declaring, \"You don't need to tell me twice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to his word, Kiba began eating the sausages faster than ever, barely chewing before he sent them to their stretchy prison. Soon enough, with another violent tear, Kiba's belly was freed as well, and it surged outwards and wobbled just like Naruto's did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was the one staring this time, as Kiba removed his robe, reveling that he was wearing a pair of special boxers. His sister had sown them for him for his birthday, and they were covered with a pattern of Akamaru's face, a testament to his love for the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow! He's wearing those!\" Akamaru though, slightly flattered, but also still a bit creeped out by it. Either way, if he could, he would have face palmed. This was due to the fact that Kiba blurted out at Naruto, \"What are you staring at? Let's eat!\", causing both of them to dig right back into their food.</span></div></div>",

Blushing, he covered his mouth. \"Heh... excuse me.\" Sighing again, he let himself flop back onto his bed, causing it to creak a bit more and his belly to stick up in the air. \"Ah, yeah, this vacation's gonna be fun.\" Smiling, he folded his arms behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, Naruto flopped back as well, instead resting his hands on his gut. \"You said it; it's nice to let loose every now and then.\" He burped suddenly, and he smiled and stuck his tongue out to the side. \"I dunno about you, but I could go for a nap right about now.\" As if to punctuate this, he yawned loudly, smacking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling into the comfort of his bed, Kiba shut his eyes. \"Yeah; nothin' like a food coma nap after a big meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, seeing where this was going, hopped up onto the bed, then onto Kiba's stomach, where he curled up and shut his own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smiled warmly at the sight. \"G'night, little buddy,\" he murmured, in spite of the fact that it was only the afternoon. Yawning, he settled in further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, letting out another yawn of his own, took his arms off his stomach and let them dangle at the sides of his bed.

That hurt boy!\" Kiba exclaimed after being woken up with a start. \"Sorry, I just got startled.\" Akamaru barked in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could possible scare ya, buddy?\" Kiba inquired as his stomach, which matched Naruto's in size and texture, gave a growl that was just as loud, causing him to jump a bit. \"Oh, I see what scared ya.\" He said. Naruto just watched, as these conversations between Kiba and Akamaru always puzzled Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, he noticed that the carts of food were no longer there, complaining, \"Hey, where'd the food go?\" \"Room service must've taken 'em\" Kiba responded as he searched his luggage for an outfit to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto did much the same, asking, \"Wanna find a restaurant to eat at?\" \"You just read my mind!\" Kiba eagerly responded as he slid on the second leg of a pair of black pants. Soon the two were fully dressed, and ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was clad in a pair of blue pants with a plain orange t-shirt with blue sleeves. He had barely managed to fasten the button, and his stomach barely lifted his t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, on the other hand, was wearing black pants and a green t-shirt with a giant blue paw print on the chest. He had an easier time with the button, as the pants were larger than the ones that he normally wore. His belly still lifted up his t-shirt just a bit, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two began slipping on their ninja sandals, Kiba asked, \"Where do ya wanna go?

It's not the first time that it's happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that nap of a few hours, Kiba's gargantuan belly had gone down considerably, but it was still quite noticeable.

He started to heat the food on both his and Naruto's carts, talking to his belly all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Naruto began stirring, and, as he was sleeping on his side, his first view of the morning was of Kiba's boxer-clad butt. That was because Kiba was bending over to heat a cart of Naruto's food that was right next to his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, get your ass outta my face, and put some clothes on!\" Naruto yelled, obviously not happy about waking up with his face so close to Kiba's behind. Kiba turned around, responding with \"I just woke up! Of course I won't have clothes on! I didn't know you would wake up, and all I was trying to do was heat your food for you!\" \"Here they go again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru thought to himself, bracing himself for more bickering, or even a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, a growl was heard coming from Naruto's stomach, which was in much of the same state as Kiba's. Naruto then rubbed the back of his head, saying, \"I guess you're right.\" Naruto was about to bring up the Chunin exams, but Kiba was still miffed about it, and Naruto didn't want to bicker more this early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the two were watching a show on TV, still in their boxers, but they didn't really care, as they were too excited for the food to heat up.

Kiba was able to work his way through, however, and as his second steak became smaller and smaller, his stomach became larger and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned to Naruto, who was shoveling noodles into his mouth, fitting as much as he could in before chewing vigorously, causing his stomach to push out just a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir stomachs continued to fill out the loose hotel robes, and, by the time Naruto was slurping the pool of broth, the fabric of the robes was beginning to stretch, and the sashes of the young shinobi created a noticable crease in their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the two were finished with their seconds, looking for more to eat. They were both focused on finishing their main dishes, so Kiba took another platter of steak while Naruto hefted another enormous bowl of ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey repeated their eating processes, and they were closing in on finishing half of their third dishes.

What now?\" Akamaru thought as Naruto, who was the closest to the door, slid to the edge of the bed, dropping to his feet, which caused his belly to wobble considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto awkwardly lumbered to the door, his stomach throwing off his balance considerably.

They couldn't help but be slightly fascinated at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was close to finishing his steak now, as he only had a piece slightly larger than his fully extended hand left. He proceeded to stuff the entire piece in his mouth, and though his cheeks were full, there was still a bit sticking out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, he used his Inuzuka canine teeth to tear through the large amount of flesh easily, and soon, he swallowed the entire bite, which was now broken up into much smaller pieces. The bite was large enough to cause a lump to be created in Kiba's throat as it wet down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as soon as Kiba's stomach allowed the steak inside, more straining was heard in Kiba's sash before it finally gave way in a loud snap. This was because the sashes were elastic, and the elastic sash that originally tried to hold Kiba's belly had hit the opposite wall before falling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's stomach now had the opportunity to surge forward, and it did, amazing Shikamaru and Akamaru as it forced open the robe, causing it to frame Kiba's sides. It also surged forward quite a few inches, and now it was extended out nearly a foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the robe and his belly were not in the way, the others would catch a glimpse of his plain grey briefs, but his belly was obstructing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, who had stopped to watch the show was now even more excited to try that himself. He proceeded to pick up his ramen bowl, which only had a few noodles left in it. He then put it to his mouth, and tipped it forward, sending everything, broth and noodles, into his demanding maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of his broth-guzzling, Naruto felt his sash pop out with a loud snapping, spinning around and hitting the wall in between Kiba and Shikamaru, giving both quite the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his stomach surged forward to where Kiba's was, Naruto continued to consume the broth until he was finally left with an empty bowl, and he rubbed his gigantic belly satisfied, his face melting into a careless grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder his belly, Shikamaru could catch a glimpse of his orange and red striped boxers, but Naruto didn't care if anyone saw, as he was enjoying himself way too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the two pre-teens were no longer being held back by the sashes, so they had much more room to fit food. Without words, both of them mercilessly dove into their last dishes of their main courses.

Akamaru, who was laying by Shikamaru to avoid the splash zone, and he continued to watch, mesmerized by the determination of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they tore through their last respective dishes, their stomachs continued to advance forward, but, because they were so large already, it wasn't by quite as much. They still got ever so slightly larger with every bite, though, and by the time that the two had finished their main dishes, each of their stomachs had protruded out over a foot, and they both rubbed their bellies satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they were both laying back in their beds, and, with massive bellies sticking into the air, Naruto and Kiba had both entered a food coma, with Naruto snoring loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru noticed this, and he looked at the situation, thinking, \"You two are ridiculous\" before starting to nod off himself. By this time, Akamaru had already laid down on Kiba's chest, and was sleeping as well.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't long before a loud ripping sound was heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's overly taxed sash had finally given away, and with a slight plopping sound, Naruto's stomach released itself, becoming round again as it pushed outward, forcing the sides of the robe open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it reached it's full size, sticking out nearly all the way to Naruto's knees as it did so. At this Naruto laid back, sighing contentedly while rubbing his stomach with a satisfied grin. With the loose robe in his way, he slipped it off, fully revealing his new orange boxers with blue swirls, but he didn't really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did so, he heard a matching ripping sound on Kiba's bed, and Kiba's sash gave out as well, his stomach advancing out in much the same manner, reaching the same size as Naruto's. He also laid back, slipping off the robe and revealing a pair of red briefs with dog bone patterns that he used to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru was completely blown away, as Naruto and Kiba weren't bickering or making fun of each other's underwear. They just laid down, rubbing their bellies contently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man that felt good!\" Kiba exclaimed. \"You said it!\" Naruto responded gleefully. \"You guys are ridiculous. How troublesome...\" Shikamaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't knock it 'till ya try it!\" Kiba responded. \"It does feel really good!\" Naruto egged on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru still refused, and this cycle continued until Kiba and Naruto gave up and Shikamaru turned the tv on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they watched their favorite shinobi shows, the three relaxing boys failed to realize what was happening. An hour later, Shikamaru stretched, then glanced over at Kiba, who was laying next to him on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru just stared in shocked silence, causing Kiba to blurt out, \"What are you staring at?!\" He then looked at his hand, and it was much smaller than he remembered. Kiba then began freaking out, realizing that everything was smaller, and that he was the same size that he was when he was seven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part was that his belly was still the same size as before, and now it covered his legs entirely, his feet sicking out from the end of the overstuffed orb of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's freaking out had woken up a napping Naruto, who soon discovered that he had suffered from the same fate. Naruto, whose belly was also covered his legs completely, freaked out much in the same manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Akamaru went over to Kiba to comfort him, Shikamaru, who remained unchanged, began thinking of a plan. \"This looks like sabotage. Why would someone want Naruto and Kiba to be smaller as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closer inspection of the two, Kiba noticed that the two had not just grown smaller, but also younger. Shikamaru decided that the best course of action now would be to...</span></div></div>",

For now, it's probably best if we stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stay?!\" Kiba blurted, eyes widening. \"Look at us, Shikamaru! If the bozo who did this to us is still here, who knows what could happen to us?!\" His bottom lip began trembling. Akamaru, noticing this, whimpered and looked up at his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed. \"Look, I know you're scared, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scared?!\" Naruto exclaimed, clenching his fists. \"I-I'm not scared!\" In spite of his words, he was trembling visibly, and his eyes were beginning to get wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru frowned. <i>Huh, looks like their minds got affected, too.</i> He rubbed the back of his neck. <i>This is gonna be even more troublesome than I thought.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what,\" Shikamaru said out loud, \"Why don't you two take a nap, let your meals digest?\" He turned towards the door. \"I'll run out and buy some new clothes for the both of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're leaving us alone?!\" Kiba practically yelled in disbelief. His own eyes were starting to get a bit wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru groaned, running his hand down his face. \"Actually, I was thinking of having Akamaru watch over you while I'm gone.\" He turned and looked down at the tiny dog. \"You know the Man-Beast Clone Technique, right?\" Akamaru barked and nodded his headed, tail wagging. \"Alright; transform and keep an eye on them; make sure no one comes in or out of the room. And above all else...\" He swept his eyes over the remaining food. \"...<i>Don't</i> let them eat anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving another bark, Akamaru concentrated and, in a puff of smoke, transformed into an exact copy of a 12-year-old Kiba, minus the belly and wearing the clothes Kiba had been when they'd first checked into the hotel (specifically, a long-sleeved tan shirt with dark patches on the elbows and gray pants). Smirking, the transformed Akamaru strolled over to Kiba and grabbing him, hefted him onto his bed, doing the same with Naruto right afterwards. Then, bending down, he picked up their discarded robes so they could cover themselves while they slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, sniffing, smiled. \"Th-thanks, boy.\" Draping his robe over his smaller (with the exception of his belly) body, he then drew his blankets over himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto did the same with his robe and blankets, lying on his side so he could rest comfortably without his belly getting in the way. Sighing, he settled in, closing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Akamaru nodded, then turned to Shikamaru and gave him a thumbs-up. The Nara couldn't help giving a tiny smile in return. \"Take care of them.\" Then, turning, he strolled out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he returned a couple hours later, bags of kid-sized clothes in his hands, he saw that, thankfully, Naruto and Kiba's meals had already digested a good part of the way.

Kiba was lying on his back and snoring gently, his still somewhat-protruding belly rising and falling as he breathed. Akamaru, still transformed but curled around him like a dog, smiled fondly at him. Naruto, on the other hand, was lying on his side and facing Shikamaru, his thumb in his mouth and his expression serene. Seeing this, Shikamaru couldn't help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, they seem to be peaceful for now,</i> Shikamaru thought, setting the bags of clothes down by each of their beds. <i>It almost seems a shame to wake them up now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of thought, Shikamaru decided he'd let the two continue to sleep as their meals digested further. Besides, he doubted any of the clothes he got would fit on either of them while their bellies were still like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Shikamaru plopped down gently on Naruto's bed, careful not to wake the boy. \"Guess there's not much else to do now but relax,\" he murmured to himself, reaching for the remote and turning the TV on. Switching to a program about puzzles, he muted the volume so as not to disturb either of the two sleepers. Grunting in satisfaction, Shikamaru settled in to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, before Shikamaru began to drift off himself, he noted that Naruto and Kiba's bellies had almost completely gone down, save for a bit of roundness around their stomachs. What was more, they were mumbling and groaning, beginning to stir. Sighing again, he got up, walked over to the bags of clothes, and waited for the boys to fully awaken. Akamaru, seeing that his guard duty was almost up, transformed back into his natural form and remained by Kiba's side, snuggling into the boy's side even as he groaned and sat up, yawning and blinking his eyes open. Naruto wasn't far behind him, rolling onto his back and, with a deep yawn, blinking his own eyes open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru smirked. \"You two have a nice sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting at Shikamaru's voice, the still-drowsy boys looked over towards him, and the bags by him.

Kiba was wearing a short-sleeved, brown T-shirt with paw prints running across the top, with a pair of tan pants covering his lower body. Naruto, on the other hand, was inspecting his new orange shirt and green cargo pants happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, these are pretty cool!\" Kiba exclaimed happily, tugging on  the fabric of his shirt. \"Thanks, Shikamaru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks!\" Naruto added, looking at his cargo-pants-covered legs and gleefully kicking them in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru nodded, but was startled when a loud growling sounded from each of the boys. At this, Naruto and Kiba blushed and held their midsections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops...guess we're kinda hungry again, huh?\" Kiba laughed, scratching his head with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, removing his arms from his stomach, looked towards the carts. \"Well, there's still a ton of food left...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering what that food did to you in the first place,\" Shikamaru cut in, striding towards the boys, \"I don't think that's such a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Naruto's faces fell. \"Awww...\" Naruto whined, pouting and folding his arms. \"But we're hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Kiba added, rubbing his mostly-flat stomach through his shirt. \"C'mon, Shikamaru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. \"Alright, alright, I'll take you out to get something. But wait for...\" He yelped as the boys practically shrieked in joy, leaping off their beds into their sandals and rushing towards the door and past him. Akamaru followed them, barking excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching them run out into the hall, Shikamaru groaned. \"Like I said...troublesome,\" he murmured, following them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he followed the boys away from the hotel and to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As before, their stomachs slowly grew as the sundaes shrank, even though there was still a decent amount left.

Naruto, lying on the seats, also yawned, covering his mouth with one hand while rubbing his belly with the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Shikamaru couldn't help but smile, but he quickly wiped it off his face; he didn't want to give those two any more hold over him than they already had. \"Alright; I'm a little tired, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Kiba leapt down from his seat, but his stuffed belly caused him to stumble and nearly fall over. Propelling his arms about, he managed to lean back against his seat, letting out a sigh and patting his stomach. \"Phew...guess we ate a little more than we thought, huh?\" He patted it a few more times, giggling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, Naruto sat back upright, stretched, and hopped down as well. Like Kiba, he stumbled, but seemed to have built up too much forward momentum. Yelping, he started falling forward, but Akamaru, thinking fast, hopped onto Naruto's recently vacated seat, leaned forward, and grabbed the back of Naruto's shirt in his mouth, keeping the boy from falling any further. Breathing a sigh of relief, Naruto turned his ice-cream stained face towards the dog and grinned widely. \"Thanks, Akamaru!\" Akamaru wagged his tail, acknowledging Naruto's gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Shikamaru turned around. \"Well, if you've got yourselves all situated, we should probably head back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Kiba gently pushed himself up off his chair, stumbling again, but managing to use his arms to maintain some semblance of balance to waddle after the older ninja. His belly shook and wobbled a bit as he walked, and to his embarrassment, he couldn't help but giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took a little longer to regain his balance, but soon enough, he was waddling right after Kiba,giggling even harder than he was at the movement of his belly. Akamaru, meanwhile, followed behind, staying close in case either of them stumbled and fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little dog sighed to himself at the sight of their swollen bellies. <i>Well,</i> the ninken thought to himself, <i>at least they bothered to unbutton their pants this time...</i></span></div></div>",

Luckily, Akamaru was able to help them whenever they did have particular trouble. Shikamaru looked at the clouds, trying to ignore them, but their antics were adorable, and quite humorous as well, so Shikamaru had trouble maintaining his cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally got to the hotel, all four of them ignoring the strange look from the hotel attendant. Either way, they got to their room, and the sun began to set. Soon enough, the two younger shinobi found two sets of pajamas in a bag that Shikamaru had bought them earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the two felt the urge to wear the pajamas, and after about ten minutes, Kiba was in a set of blue pajamas with dog bones on them, his bloated belly sticking out of them comically. Luckily, the waistband was elastic so it was able to stretch more to accommodate for the bottom of Kiba's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was clad in a pair of similar pajamas, his being orange with shuriken patterns instead. His belly also stuck out considerably, and he was still rubbing it contentedly, as he had been doing since he finished his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru was surprised, shocked, in fact, to see the two act like best friends on this vacation, despite this rivalry that they had when they were older. Naruto had always wanted a friend the first time he was that age, and luckily, this time he had one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru was even more surprised by the fact that the two were willing to share the first bed so that Shikamaru could have the other. Soon enough, they were on either side of the bed, with Akamaru in between them. Naruto even began to suck his thumb as he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru smiled warmly, almost as a parent would. Seeing these two at a young age and having to care for them was really softening Shikamaru up. He was still Shikamaru, though, and soon enough, he was reading a book about shogi strategies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't really have any separate clothes for the night. Instead, he merely took off his flak jacket and his shirt, leaving himself in his fishnet underneath. Soon enough, though, he also dozed off for the night.</span></div></div>",

Scratching the back of his head and yawning, he blinked open his eyes and looked about the room, taking in his surroundings. It was early morning, if the intensity of the sun's rays were any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Shikamaru sighed, reluctantly swinging his legs over the side of the bed and standing up, pressing his hands on his back and pushing it forward to pop it back into place, \"I was hoping to sleep for a little bit longer...\" Sighing, he turned his head, focusing on the room's other bed-or more specifically, it's current occupants. Upon catching sight of them, the corners of his mouth quirked upwards the slightest bit, and he couldn't help but feel his mood being lifted, if only a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba, still stuck as young children, were currently sprawled out hapzardly on the bed, snoring gently. Their massive meals from yesterday had, thankfully, digested completely, leaving them once again flat-bellied. Naruto was sprawled out completely on his back, arms and legs stretched out to their maximum length. A tiny bit of drool had traced a line down the corner of his mouth, which he was, apparently, oblivious to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, situated on the opposite side of the bed but a little lower down, looked equally peaceful. His right hand was situated near his mouth, his thumb inserted neatly into it. His left hand, meanwhile, was extended far above his head, stretching his pajama shirt in such a way that it rode up, exposing his stomach. Akamaru, apparently not wanting Kiba to get cold, had curled up on the bare flesh, and was also snoozing peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru couldn't help but smile a little wider at this; as annoying as they may have been, they really were really cute like this. This thought, however, was accompanied with a new concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth younger shinobi were obviously far more vulnerable like this; not only were they more subject to the physical needs of any kid, including sleep, but their minds could be a problem as well; though both would object, they would be more likely to lose their cool in a dangerous situation, one that an enemy would be all too happy to take advantage of. Given the situation, it would be best to return to Konoha now, both to better protect them and to see if Tsunade could work out a cure for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru groaned, facepalming. \"They're not gonna be happy about this...\" he muttered. Making his way over to the two, he gently shook them awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto snorted. \"Huh-wha?!\" Bolting upright, his panic subsided when he saw Shikamaru standing over them. \"Shikamaru? What's goin' on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba soon followed suit; opening his eyes, he gently pushed himself up on his hands to look at Shikamaru. \"Huh? What is it?\" Akamaru, disturbed by the shift in position, yawned and blinked his own eyes open, looking blearily at Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed. <i>Here comes the troublesome part...</i> \"Look...I know you two just started your vacation, but we need to get back to the village; you're too vulnerable like this, and we need to get the Hokage to take a look at you to try to find a cure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba looked at each other, processing this information.

Shikamaru gaped at the sheer quantity of food heaped upon each: donuts, egg, bacon, sausages (especially in Kiba's case), fruit, a bit of ice cream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, the two boys were grinning as they plopped their massive dishes onto the table, causing it to creak and groan under the weight; luckily, it held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking their lips, both children clasped their hands together, chirped \"Itadakimasu!\" as one, then began digging in.

He wasn't really concentrating on his own eating, however, as he was far two worried about Naruto and Kiba, who were currently stuffing their faces gleefully in yet another display of careless gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was particularly surprised that the two weren't more worried about their sudden lack of age. In fact, they seemed to be happier, and they got along a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru merely laid down under the table, resigned, as he could do nothing to stop the two young boys. In fact, he had a front row seat to the stuffing, and he was curious to see how far they would go this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, as Naruto dug into his scrambled eggs, he talked to Kiba about nearly everything; memories about past missions, gossip about their classmates, and even little things and accompanying giggles were exchanged between the two as they stuffed their maws unconsciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba also started with his eggs, which were sunny side up, as he enjoyed the runny yolks. Soon, Naruto was chewing through pieces of pineapple and Kiba was stuffing sugary doughnuts in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru watched as Naruto finished all of his fruit and Kiba finished all of his doughnuts, and the stomachs of the two became distended, creating a barely-noticeable imprint on both of their shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba moved on to the massive amount of sausages that he picked, tearing into each juicy breakfast sausage gleefully while Naruto began to chew on slice after slice of crispy bacon, a childish, yet warming smile on his whiskered face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they tore through their various foods, their stomachs began to strain their shirts again, and soon their shirts were lifting up again and their pants began to strain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished his bacon, Naruto felt the strain, and soon he was struggling with the button on his shorts. Kiba had noticed this, and through bites of sausage, he asked \"What are you doin'\", only receiving a few grunts in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba watched on, head cocked to the side in curiosity, Naruto finished, sighing in relief, sitting back to rub his belly a little, saying \"Man, that feels better. You should try unbottoning your shorts, Kiba!\" before digging into his doughnuts without a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the cue, Kiba managed to unbutton his shorts, struggling to work around his stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, more food and conversation were had, and as the two ate, their shirts rose higher, and their flies were forced farther and farther downward. When Kiba finally finished his sausages and moved on to his bacon, Naruto went to eat his own sausages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, their flies were forced all the way downwards, and their navels were beginning to see the light of day due to the rising of their shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, all that was left was the ice cream, and both boys, proudly displaying their distended stomachs, dug into their ice cream mercilessly. Shikamaru and Akamaru were just glad that the buffet was nearly empty, so they didn't attract much attention from anyone other than the employees, who stared at the two confusedly before shrugging it off and getting back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Shikamaru let out a sigh of relief as the two finally finished their gargantuan plates, each of them leaning back and rubbing their bellies. Akamaru had since fallen asleep waiting for the two to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was sooo good!\" Naruto exclaimed cheerfully. \"Yeah, those sausages were magical!\" Kiba replied. \"I'm glad this is all-you-can-eat!\" Naruto added, \"Cuz I'm gonna get more!\". \"You don't need to tell me twice!\" was Kiba's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Shikamau's dismay, the two eagerly waddled to back to the buffet lines, their bellies wobbling all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the two had finally finished. In their wake, the employees needed to refill the sausage tray twice for Kiba, and they also needed to replace the doughnut tray and refill the ice cream dispenser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two de-aged shinobi laid back, literally stuffed silly as they each rubbed their comically overstuffed bellies. Their navels had since inverted, as their bellies each stuck more than a foot outwards, a ridiculous amount for someone their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were oblivious, as they were finally sated and ready to go, idly talking to each other. \"At least the food costs the same.\" Shikamaru thought as he stared at the two in awe. He couldn't help but smile at the sight of their faces, though. \"Man, I've gotten soft. How troublesome.\" He thought as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another thought came to his mind, and he asked, \"How are you guys going to walk home?\" causing the two to fall silent as they thought of a plan to get home in their current stuffed states.</span></div></div>",

Sign us up! Sign us up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute.\" Shikamaru stood up, fixing the two with a stern look. \"We can't waste our time here; we need to get back to the village and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, noticing Shikamaru's forehead protector (currently tied around his arm), blinked. \"Wait...you're from Konoha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of where the man was going with this, Shikamaru nodded. \"What of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed heartily. \"Dear boy, the contest is being held right in that very village!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru's jaw dropped open in a rather uncharacteristic display of shock.

Tsunade was surprised to see two seven-year-old versions of Naruto and Kiba sporting stuffed bellies when they got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was even more surprised to see them talking to each other and giggling. They even ran up and hugged Tsunade when they saw her despite their bellies, with Naruto yelling \"Tsunade Baa-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Tsunade said that she needed to take Naruto and Kiba's physicals too see what has happened. Soon, she was done, and she got her results surprisingly quickly. Soon, the four of them sat in front of Tsunade's desk, waiting for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It turns out that you two ingested a special tree bark extract. This tree bark is known for it's anti-aging properties, and it can even be used in food as a tenderizer. It is highly expensive, so it is rarely used in anywhere but the most expensive restaurants. On normal humans, there are virtually no effects in ingesting this extract, however in shinobi, the extract's effects are enhanced by chakra flow, and the aging process was reversed and sped up until the extract was used up. That left you two around seven. Typically restaurants are supposed to have warnings on their menus to prevent this from happening. You two were unlucky enough to run into a restaurant that lacks that warning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the cure, baa-chan!\" Naruto loudly blurted, interrupting her. Soon enough, he was sent flying back to the wall with a flick of Tsunade's fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was saying,\" she asserted, \"that there is a cure, but it will take a while. We have to attach you to a special machine that delivers all of the nourishment that you will need to get back to your normal ages. You will then be placed in a medically-induced-coma\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coma?!\" Kiba interrupted this time, receiving a similar flick from Tsunade, sending him to the wall right next to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry!\" She assured. \"It will probably take less than 24 hours. The coma is necessary so that your metabolic processes are slowed down and your bodies don't go into shock. Then, I will send a signal through your chakra to age much faster. As long as the procedure goes smoothly, you two will wake up being twelve again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the two were ready and in the hospital, and, as commanded by Tsunade, they removed all of their clothing and got into hospital gowns that would fit them when they become twelve again. They laid down in two neighboring hospital beds, and were taken into a special room where they could become older again without interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru opted to be with Kiba, and Tsunade allowed it, as long as he didn't mess with the equipment. Either way, once the process begun, Akamaru watched as the past five years with Kiba went by in a matter of hours. Soon, the two were twelve again, and they were back to their old selves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***Four weeks later***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past four weeks, Naruto and Kiba trained together for the upcoming eating contest. When they were strapped for time, they would merely use water, guzzling as much as possible to stretch their stomachs out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they could, they would have eating competitions as various restaurants around Konoha, stuffing themselves as much as possible one hoping to eat more than the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would even opt to go on missions together, and they worked very well together now. \"I never thought that they would even be this close.\" Tsunade thought as Naruto insisted on joining Kiba and Akamaru on a mission to take out an elusive criminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was the day of the contest, though, and the two were together on a tag team, with Akamaru getting a front row seat, ready to compete if he chose to do so. Both of them wore their normal pants and their shinobi sandals, and with that, they wore white t-shirts with the buffet's logo. They also proudly wore their leaf headbands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually a holiday in Konoha, so everyone had a day off, and many chose to watch the competition. All of the rookies and their senseis, the members from team Guy, and even Sasuke were all there to support Kiba and Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they were read the rules by one of the judges. Basically there were tag teams of two, and there was an optional third member, but animals weren't allowed, so if Akamaru were to compete, he would need to transform into a Kiba clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, there were multiple rounds, with teams choosing one member for each round, in which they would eat a certain amount of a certain food in a certain amount of time. One free team member was then allowed to do anything in their power to aid the competing member. It could be anything from a simple pep talk to something as drastic as feeding the competing member to maintain speed, or rubbing their belly to ease pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the round is finished, the contestants who couldn't make it in time were disqualified, and with the next round, the team could choose to leave in their current contestant or switch out to a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed with this knowledge and the potential additional help of Akamaru, the two were ready for anything.</span></div></div>",

It was, specifically, a massive mound of the sausages he had so enjoyed when they had first gone to the buffet. Even Akamaru's eyes bugged out at the sheer size of the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, seeing Kiba's eager expression, blinked. \"You, uh, wanna take this one, Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Kiba playfully punched Naruto in the shoulder. \"What do you think, dummy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing, Naruto rubbed the point of impact. \"Alright, alright, I got it.\" He smiled. \"Go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned. \"Thanks, Naruto; you're a pal.\" Hearing a whimper, he looked down at Akamaru, who was staring at the sausages longingly. \"Don't worry, boy; you can take the next round.\" He smirked. \"Plus, when we win, you can have as many of the sausages as you want.\" The dog seemed to perk up considerably at this, wagging his tail happily. Smiling at his dog, Kiba turned back to the plate, rubbing his hands together eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer raised his hand. \"Ready...Set...GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contestants fell to it with a will. Kiba, not wasting any time, grabbed as many sausages as he could in both hands and shoving them in his mouth. Grunting, he chewed the mass, working it down to a reasonable size before gulping the whole thing, heedless of the smears of grease that got around his mouth and on his shirt; there would be time for that later. Licking his lips and grinning, he nonetheless dove right back in, getting an even bigger handful and cramming them in his mouth. It took a little longer to chew, but he managed it, finally swallowing it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for his eyes to bug out and him to start pounding his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sweatdropped. \"Uh, take a little too much of a big mouthful there, Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill coughing and pounding his chest, Kiba shot a glare at Naruto that clearly said \"quit standing around and help me, you idiot!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing the back of his head, Naruto laughed nervously. \"Alright, alright.\" Walking over to Kiba, he thumped the other boy on the chest. Almost immediately afterwards, Kiba gasped, clutching his chest and panting. Worried, Akamaru, looked up at his friend, tilting his head and whining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba managed to smirk. \"Don't worry about it, boy; I'm fine.\" He only continued panting for a few more seconds before continuing to attack the plate. This time, he took a different approach, grabbing two big handfuls in each hand; he would shove one in, chew and swallow, grab another handful with his unoccupied hand while shoving the second handful in...rinse and repeat. Slowly, the stack of sausages began shrinking; within a matter of minutes, it was almost gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five seconds left!\" The announcer's voice called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndeterred, Kiba grabbed the still-considerable mound of remaining sausages and lifted them to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba crammed the entire thing in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba began chewing like a madman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba slowly got it down to a more manageable size, at least to the point he could chew quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Akamaru leaned forward as Kiba continued chewing, finally gulping the entire thing down with a pained look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out, Kiba grabbed the plate and licked whatever grease was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming the plate down, Kiba burped and patted his stomach, a satisfied look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Kiba,\" Naruto said, fixing the dog-nin with an approving look, \"that was really close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded, smirking cockily. \"Yep, but I pulled through.\" He continued rubbing his stomach, which, owing to the sheer size of the plate, had already started to make a noticeable impression on his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next round!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Kiba looked up. \"Next round already?\" He grinned. \"Eh, whatever; we can take it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot hearing Kiba, the announcer continued. \"The next round will be...\"</span></div></div>",

At that Akamaru dropped his head, worried that he wouln't be able to compete as well. \"Don't be sad\" Kiba assured. \"There's bound to be a round that's perfect for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Kiba was sitting next to Naruto, who was waiting for the ramen to arrive. They were both surprised to see a large stock pot filled to the brim with ramen, topped with all of the extras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a serving bowl next to it, and a ladle for serving. This was done so that the competition didn't have to use so many bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, being Naruto, decided to ignore the serving bowl, instead diving right into the pot with his chopsticks. As soon as he took a bite, he practically screamed, \"Yes! This is Ichiraku's!\" and he dove in insanely fast, shoveling a constant stream of noodles from the pot to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Naruto get ahead of the others so quickly, Kiba leaned back, confident that Naruto wouldn't even need him there. \"I'm glad I let Naruto do this!\" Kiba thought as he saw the awestruck faces of nearly everyone in the audiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, his stomach, despite being somewhat stuffed, growled. \"Don't worry, you'll get back in the spotlight soon\" Kiba said to the complaining appendage, receiving a few strange looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, by the time he looked back over at Naruto, he saw that Naruto had finished all of the noodles already, leaving his stomach at around the same size as Kiba's. He was currently struggling to lift the stockpot up so that he could drink the gallon or so of broth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, before Naruto could even ask, he helped Naruto lift up the stock pot, and he tipped it into Naruto's mouth, holding it steady for him, receiving a thumbs up and a series of garbled grunts from Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an astounding display of teamwork!\" the announcer cried, gesturing to the two, amazed at the sight before him. Soon enough, most of the audience was cheering wildly at the spectacle before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about five minutes, Kiba continued to hold the stock pot up for Naruto, who was greedily taking the entirety of the liquid in, rubbing his quickly expanding belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Naruto's rapidly swelling belly started lifting up his t-shirt until it was about halfway to his navel. \"It looks like the rounds get bigger and bigger!\" Kiba thought as he took the stock pot away, as Naruto had finally finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was finished, Naruto stood up, lifting both of his fists into the air, displaying his belly proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Naruto and Kiba were high-fiving and talking about what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it, the next round was being announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer yelled, \"The next round is.....\"</span></div></div>",

Kiba, seeing his tail wag, laughed. Bending down and ruffling his buddy's fur, Kiba grinned. \"Alright, boy; you can take this round.\" Akamaru nodding, concentrated, and, in a puff of smoke, transformed into an exact copy of Kiba. The crowd, noticing this, raised their eyebrows; even though many of them already knew about Kiba's jutsu, seeing the dog transform was a bit... odd, to say the very least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnperturbed, Kiba clapped a hand on Akamaru's shoulder. \"Alright, buddy, it's real simple: ya pick the stick up,\" he mimed doing so, \"and pull as many dumplings off at a time as ya can.\" He mimed taking a huge bite and pulling away. \"Can ya do that, Akamaru?\" Eyes gleaming, the transformed dog nodded and took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of their confidence, all three of their eyes bugged out when the tray of dango was brought before them. It was stacked at least a foot high with sticks of dango; the dumplings themselves were massive, easily dwarfing the biggest sticks the local dango shop usually had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru stared at the sticks before him and actually gulped; no matter what form he was in, he was still a tiny dog...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started as a hand was laid on his shoulder. Looking, he saw Kiba, smiling at him warmly. \"Don't worry, boy; I know you can do this.\" At the praise, Akamaru beamed. Kiba believed in him; there was no way he could let him down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Akamaru attacked the dango with ferocious abandon; grabbing a stick in each hand, he pulled off as many dumplings in his teeth as he could, chewing until it was a more manageable size, then cramming the rest in. Once that had been done, he tossed the empty sticks to the side, chewed the new dumplings until he had some space in his mouth, the grabbed two new sticks of dango and repeated the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woohoo!\" Kiba pumped a fist in the air as the pile began to shrink. \"Go, Akamaru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it, Akamaru!\" Naruto called, throwing his support in as well. Grinning back at the two, Akamaru continued attacking the plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, the plate of dango began to shrink. As it did, Akamaru's transformed stomach began showing signs of being affected, first making a noticeable imprint against his shirt, and, as the pile shrank even more, pressing out a bit. Akamaru winced, obviously noticing this, but he pressed on, determined not to let Kiba down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plate of dango continued shrinking, and Akamaru's stomach continued growing, pressing harder against the shirt. Again, Akamaru winced, this time feeling a sharp bolt of pain through his gut. Gulping, he stared at the dango left on his plate; there was less than half left, but it was still a considerable amount. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, buddy!\" Kiba called, smacking him on the back. \"You're so close! Don't give up now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to his partner, Akamaru's eyes widened, and he smiled. It didn't matter how much was left; he was gonna help them win this thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he dove back in, this time with a renewed fervor. He ripped the dango off the sticks wildly, chewing only as much as he needed to to gulp it down. It was a bit rough going down, but Akamaru kept at it. In the meantime, his belly continued to slowly grow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer made this declaration just as Akamaru gulped down the last dumpling. Sighing, he leaned back in his chair, patting his stomach. It now had a rather round appearance under his shirt, and was even starting to push it up a little bit. <i>Oh man, what am I gonna look like once I change back?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny reservations he had, however, abated immediately as Naruto and Kiba strolled up to him, grabbing his arms and lifting him out of his seat. \"Atta boy, Akamaru!\" Kiba exclaimed, ruffling the top of his head. \"I knew you could do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta admit,\" Naruto added, patting Akamaru's stomach heartily and causing the transformed dog to blush slightly, \"that was pretty impressive.\" Akamaru smiled and burped, rather pleased with himself. Closing his eyes, he concentrated again, and in a puff of smoke, he returned to his natural form. Giving a little sigh, he flopped over onto his back, looking downwards and examining his own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, it was not yet big enough to cause him trouble walking, and he would be able to participate in another round (though he would need a break first,) but it was rather rounded and stuck up into the air a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling at the sight, Kiba bent down and rubbed his slightly stuffed tummy, causing Akamaru's tail to wag and his tongue to loll out the side of his mouth. \"Rest up, buddy; you've earned it.\" He stood back up, sharing a smirk with Naruto; what were they gonna do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though on cue, the announcer spoke up. \"The next round is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked at the plate...and gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching at least three feet into the air, the plate was loaded with all kinds of doughnuts, packed tightly together and arranged in such a way that dozens upon dozens of donuts were heaped upon one another.<br>\r\nNaruto took a whiff, and it was all he could do not to salivate; these were fresh-baked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, this looks yummy...\" Naruto murmured to himself, rubbing his hands together. At this, Kiba and Akamaru merely exchanged a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, set...GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the announcer's declaration, Naruto attacked his plate, tossing donuts  into his maw and chewing and swallowing as fast as he could. He moaned slightly at the delicious flavors and the warm, fresh-baked scent and taste, but he continued cramming donuts into his maw, determined not to let up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed, and he was about a quarter through the massive plate. Already, though, it was starting to have an effect on his already somewhat-stuffed tummy: it had grown bigger and rounder, and had pushed his shirt up further, to the point where every part of his belly from his navel down was exposed (the small pit itself had not made an appearance yet, though his shirt was just barely managing to conceal it.) Still, Naruto never slowed down, continuing to shovel the donuts into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba glanced up at the crowd, wincing. \"C'mon, Naruto, hurry it up! Half the time's almost up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouth full of powdered doughnut, Naruto looked up and scowled at Kiba. \"What's it look like I'm doing, dog-breath?\" he retorted, spraying powdered sugar everywhere and causing Kiba to yelp in surprise and disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, for the love of...Akamaru, I need ya to transform,\" Kiba instructed his resting buddy. \"We're gonna hafta take drastic measures.\" Getting Kiba's meaning and wagging his tail, Akamaru once more transformed into a copy of Kiba, his stomach still showing the effects of the dango.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked, not sure if he liked where this is going. \"What are you guMMMPH!\" He yelped as Kiba grabbed two donuts and shoved them in his mouth. Akamaru stood by, another couple donuts in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and eat,\" Kiba murmured, smirking at Naruto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling, but not seeing any other option, Naruto began chewing rapidly, grunting but not letting up as Akamaru shoved his donuts in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they advanced into a system: Naruto would chew the donuts until he had some room in his mouth, at which point Kiba and Akamaru would cram as many as they could into his mouth at a time. Slowly, the plate began shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the sheer volume of donuts being ingested, Naruto's stomach grew fairly quickly; his shirt slowly slid up, exposing first half of his navel, then the whole thing, then the skin above that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, there was only less than a quarter of the donuts left, and Naruto's stomach stuck out a good ways in front of him. In addition, his waistline was feeling quite tight, but he didn't move to unbutton it, for fear it would cause them to lose their groove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One minute left!\" the announcer called suddenly. The eyes of Kiba, Naruto, and Akamaru widened, and they picked up their pace. Slowly, the remainder of the donuts continued to shrink, Naruto's stomach continued to swell, and his waistline continued to grow tighter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaand... time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis declaration rang out just as Naruto swallowed the last doughnut. Letting out a satisfied burp, he patted his belly and looked down at it to further examine the state it was in. His stomach was now taking on a distinctly spherical appearance, sticking out a few inches in front of him and displaying not only his navel, but a few inches of skin above it. His pants were incredibly tight, and they strained visibly as they attempted to hold the swollen mass back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, that was a close one,\" Naruto murmured, rubbing his belly with one hand. He looked up at Kiba and Akamaru and smirked. \"That was a pretty good idea, guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked in return, while Akamaru beamed and returned to his natural dog self. \"Eh, what can I say? I'm a ninja; thinking fast is part of the job description.\" Naruto rolled his eyes, but  continued rubbing. Unknown to any of them, the waistline of his orange pants was beginning to quiver, and the fabric around the button began looking quite strained. It quivered, quivered, quivered...then, as Naruto let out another satisfied belch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened as his pants button finally gave up the ghost, sailing off his pants and arcing up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....to hit Kiba on the forehead. Akamaru looked up at his friend, concerned for his safety, while Naruto seemed unsure as to whether he should be embarrassed or amused. \"H-heh...y-you OK, Kiba?\" Naruto snorted as Kiba winced and massaged the point of impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine, no thanks to you!\" Kiba retorted, glaring at his friend. \"Next time, undo your damn pants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto opened his mouth to protest that they hadn't even given him time when the announcer spoke up again. \"Next up is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Looks like you're up.\" Naruto said before belching, as he knew that any kind of meat would be Kiba's strong suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was about to ask Akamaru if he wanted to try, but Akamaru was too busy rubbing his belly in discomfort. \"Looks like you're not up to it, buddy.\" Kiba said, sympathizing for his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would be able to handle this, dog breath!\" Naruto blurted out, before Kiba yelled back, \"I was just making sure he's OK!\" Then he calmed down a bit before adding, \"Besides, I know a good Inuzuka trick for eating ribs fast!\" smiling to show off his pronounced canine teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba said this, a platter of ribs was brought out. This platter would easily be able to house a large turkey. Instead, there was a monstrous pile of ribs covering the platter. The volunteer who held it had to be careful not to cause it to fall. He placed it on the table with a loud thump to indicate it's heaviness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ribs, which were both pork and beef ribs, had a strong, delicious scent, which wafted towards Kiba, causing his stomach to growl loudly despite his mildly stuffed stomach, causing him to say, \"At least I brought my appetite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto merely replied, \"Good! What can I do to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba said, \"I'll show you the trick. Just follow me when you get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded before the whistle went off, indicating that they begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Kiba grabbed a rib, placing the end of the rib in his mouth, all the way to the joint. Then he bit down just before the joint, and pulled the rib out, using his canines to both pull the meat off and shred it so that all he had to do was swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing!\" Naruto exclaimed, awestruck, as Kiba grabbed another rib, saying \"Man, these are awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just watched as Kiba continued to strip the ribs of their meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for!\" Kiba yelled through bites of rib, spraying bits of meat everywhere, causing Naruto to refocus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right!\" Naruto said as he grabbed a rib, then he held it in the right position for, who bit on. As soon as Kiba did so, Naruto pulled the rib out, finding it completely clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so cool!\" Naruto thought. He got excited, so he continued the process as fast as he could. He didn't leave much time for Kiba to swallow though, and soon, Kiba's cheeks were full to bursting with meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba angrily shook his fists at Naruto before being swallowing with difficulty. Then he screamed \"Slow down!\", which only caused Naruto to giggle slightly, adding, \"Maybe you can do three at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was initially mad, but then the light bulb went off in his head. \"Maybe that's not a bad idea. Just let me swallow this time!\" He yelled. Naruto nodded in understanding before loading Kiba up with three ribs this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, they were able to get a good rhythm going, and though they lost a lot of time, they were catching up once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba continued to consume the nearly endless pile, his stomach advanced out farther and farther, lifting his shirt slowly but steadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shirt crept up past his navel, and his pants button began quivering as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the pile, Kiba's button was about to give out, and his shirt was nearly to the top of his bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few ribs later, Kiba's button violently popped off, and an \"Ow! What was that!\" Was heard in the audience. This went unnoticed, however, as Kiba and Naruto were in the zone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, in his man-beast form, had even tagged in by this time, and like a pit crew in a car race, they worked very efficiently. Naruto placed a new set of ribs in, then Akamaru pulled them out and threw them away, only to be replaced by new ones from Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's stomach continued to advance outwards, no longer being quite as restricted. The bottom seam of his shirt was beginning to strain, however, so he took a second to throw it off quickly before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pants weren't so lucky, however, as the zipper was continuing to be forced down, and the seams around his zipper were struggling. He paid it no mind, though, as he continued to accept more and more ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach continued to advance forward, and about two-thirds of the way through the round, Kiba's stomach reached the table, where it was bisected, with half going on top, and half reaching out below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba winced in pain at all of this strain, and Akamaru quickly came to the rescue, leaving Naruto to fill Kiba with ribs while he rubbed Kiba's belly to provide relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of the round, a loud rip was heard, and the top of Kiba's inseam ripped to accommodate for his gigantic midsection. \"Oh man, my mom's gonna kill me!\" he thought, but soon he regained focus, more determined than ever to reach the finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, time wasn't as much of an issue because they had gained so much speed, but there was still plenty of opportunity to fail, so the three of them didn't relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after they took up nearly all of the 45 minute time limit, the team of Naruto, Kiba, and Akamaru finished, pumping their fists in the air victoriously before the ending whistle was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was going wild, and they went even wilder as the announcer exclaimed...</span></div></div>",

That was nothing, though, compared to the contestants' reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo!\" Kiba whooped, high-fiving the still-transformed Akamaru. \"We won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, meanwhile, was hopping up and down ecstatically, his stuffed belly shaking and wobbling about for everyone to see. In addition, it gave the rather annoyed Kiba several glimpses of his green, orange squiggle-patterned boxers. He opened his mouth to protest, but was interrupted when an attendant, who had somehow snuck up on them, thrust a pair of tickets in their faces. \"Congratulations, you two! For your prize, you win one month of free, all-you-can eat food from our buffet line!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Naruto took the proffered tickets, beaming widely. Akamaru, in the meantime, simply whined. <i>Oh geez... who knows how this is gonna end?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n\"Alright, Naruto, what's this about?\" Kiba demanded as he stood in the middle of Naruto's apartment, arms folded and Akamaru resting comfortably on his head.  It was later that night, and the boys' massive morning meals had digested, leaving little more than round shapes that barely pressed against Kiba's grey jacket and Naruto's orange jacket.\"And why did you have me bring these?\" He indicated a bundle held in his arm that consisted of clothes he had loved as a child: a dark green, v-necked shirt with red lining around the neck and a goofy dog face on the front along with dark blue/gray pants and a pair of small sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit earlier, Naruto had asked Kiba to come by his apartment before they partook of their prize (the buffet had brought a ton of food, so they were staying in the village for a few days, and they had every intention of taking full advantage of it), which had confused the dog-nin a bit; they had two separate tickets, so it wasn't like they needed to go together. Still, he didn't have much else to do that night, so he'd agreed to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned, patting the pile of clothes that were lying beside him on his bed: Akamaru looked closer and realized, to his horror, that they were clothes Naruto had loved to wear during his early Academy days: specifically, a pair of green cargo pants, a blue t-shirt, and a sleeveless, zip-up orange hoodie. <i>Please don't tell me he's thinking what I think he's thinking...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto spent a few more seconds grinning before replying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's easy: we're gonna turn ourselves into little kids again before we go out to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what,\" Kiba muttered flatly, Akamaru whining in resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Naruto replied cheerfully, striding over to the kitchen and grabbing a pair of recently-heated instant ramen cups. \"I mean, Granny found a way to change us back, so I figured, why not cut loose and have fun like we did on vacation?\" Naruto grinned, handing one to Kiba. \"Remember that extract that did it to us in the first place? Well, it turns out, the guys who hosted the competition had a ton of it, but didn't use any in today's contest 'cause there were ninjas competing.\" He smirked viciously. \"So, I used some of my ninja skills, swiped abunch, and tested it on my Shadow Clones 'till I made sure I knew the right amount to add to these ramen cups to make us like we were on vacation!\" Striding over to the kitchen table, he grabbed a pair of chopsticks, brought them to the cup, and began slurping them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stared for a few seconds before sighing. \"Oh, what the hell.\" Walking over to the table, he sat down, got his own pair of chopsticks, and began slurping up his own noodles. Akamaru, still perched on Kiba's head, whined and covered his eyes with his ears. <i>This is gonna suck, I know it will...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Naruto and Kiba bolted through the doors of the restaurant, grinning widely as they looked about. The building the buffet was using as its temporary location was huge, even bigger than the one they'd gone to on vacation. As such, there were even more sections and choices than before: chicken, beef, noodles, cakes, pies, donuts, ice cream... it was a testament to the quality of the place that, in spite of its sheer size, it was packed with villagers, both civilians and ninja, of all ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, a dopey grin on his face, took a deep whiff. \"Oh man,\" he moaned, bending down to let Akamaru jump into his arms and onto his head, \"That smells awesome!\" He licked his lips. \"What should we get first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned at his friend. \"Hey, it's a buffet: we don't have to choose!\" He looked around: a great many of the tables and booths were already filled. \"First, we gotta find a place to sit, though...\" He laughed nervously, rubbing the back of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Kiba nonetheless nodded. \"Yeah; let's just hope we can find a seat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that someone in the crowd noticed the two. Eyes widening, he motioned to the two, getting the attention of those around him. As soon as they looked at the two kids, their eyes widened, and they began chattering:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, aren't those the kids who won today's contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, they look a lot younger; maybe little brothers or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, that's them; I know it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to think of it, a bunch of that bark extract's gone missing...\" Naruto flinched at that, laughing nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, news of the two's presence in the buffet had spread, and soon, nearly everyone's attention was on them as they chattered on, many admiringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh,\" Naruto grinned, folding his arms behind his head. \"Do ya see that, Kiba? We're famous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba returned his grin, but winced as his stomach growled. \"Yeah, that's pretty great, but let's go find a seat; I'm starving!\" He rubbed his belly. \"My tummy needs food!\" As soon as the words left his mouth, he blushed. \"I can't believe I just said that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Naruto headed off, Kiba and Akamaru following behind, and soon, they were searching for a seat. By some stroke of luck, they found an unoccupied booth, which they happily slid into. Akamaru wasn't so happy. <i>A booth? You've gotta be kidding me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of Akamaru's grousing, the boys settled in, ordered their drinks, then headed to the buffet to load up.  They walked together part of the way, but soon split to better fill their plates with the items they wanted. Kiba filled his plate with all manner of meat: fried chicken, burgers, bacon, steak, ribs sausages...and of course, a few donuts, slices of cake, and other assorted sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, on the other hand, opted for a heaping helping of noodles, along with some slices of pizza, ribs (they HAD smelled good), french fries, some fruit, and some meat of his own, including burgers and barbecued meat. Predictably, he'd also loaded his plate up with sweets: danishes, ice cream, and pie, to name just a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he loaded his plate up, Naruto fidgeted a bit as the restaurant's patrons looked at him and chattered excitedly. It was a bit weird, being watched as he got his food; still, stares of excitement were way better than stares of distrust, hatred... <i>Wait a minute, where did <b>that</b> come from?</i> Resolving to think about it later, he finished heaping food upon his plate and staggered back to his booth, struggling under the weight of the platter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoincidentally, he reached the booth at about the same time Kiba did; his plate was just as loaded up as Naruto's. Akamaru, oddly enough, was beside him, having transformed into a copy of Kiba's younger self (he'd opted against transforming into an image of Kiba at his proper age, on the grounds that it would look creepy) and carrying a plate loaded up with nothing but sausages. At Naruto's questioning look, Kiba shrugged. \"Hey, I promised him he could eat as many sausages as he wanted once we won.\" Beaming, Akamaru set his plate of sausages besides the place where Kiba would seat, transformed back into his natural canine form, and began going to town on the sausages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Naruto slid into is seat and grabbed a pair of chopsticks, targeting his noodles. \"Eh, whatever makes ya happy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Kiba did the same, picking up a piece of fried chicken and biting into it. He moaned happily as the juice dribbled down his chin. \"Oh man...this is amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto slurped up some of his noodles, and his face brightened. \"Oh man, so are these! I mean, they still don't beat Ichiraku's, but still...\" He reached out with his chopsticks again, this time getting a more substantial helping of noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto continued eating the noodles and Kiba continued eating his chicken, a crowd slowly gathered around them, having noticed the sheer amount of food their plates held, and all of them were wondering: even when they were like this, did they still have massive appetites?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon, the crowd would get their answer. As Naruto ate, he caught occasional glances over at Kiba, and he even flashed a goofy grin whenever he saw Kiba looking back. He was fascinated by the growth of Kiba's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as Kiba downed a few ribs with his tricks, causing the imprint in his shirt to become even more apparent. \"Wow, that's so cool!\" Naruto thought. \"I can see Kiba's belly get bigger with every bite! I wonder how mine's doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was doing much of the same thing, catching a glimpse of Naruto eating every once in a while. He watched Naruto's belly, which now forced his shirt to start riding up as he stuffed his face with assorted pastries. \"Man, Naruto can pack it away!\" Kiba thought. \"Is that what I look like when I eat a lot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba also looked at Akamaru, who was in complete bliss, ignoring everything else much like Kiba and Naruto typically did. He was actually eating faster than Kiba and Naruto, and his stomach was large enough to begin forcing his legs apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Akamaru's having fun!\" Kiba thought as he smiled warmly. \"He's not going to be able to move if he eats much more!\" That thought caused Kiba to chuckle slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught Naruto's attention. \"Hey, what's so funny?\" Naruto questioned. He then glanced at Akamaru, seeing the dog enjoy himself as he stuffed his face in bliss. Naruto then began giggling a bit before Kiba gave him a dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was amazed at how casually the two boys stuffed themselves with plates that none of them could handle. They were even more surprised to see that Kiba and Naruto were finished soon afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir stomachs were now distended considerably, forcing their shirts to ride just barely above their navels. Naruto then burped loudly before giggling. \"Hehe, I can see your belly button Kiba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba burped loudly as well, saying, \"Yours is sticking out too!\" with a pouting face. Soon enough, however, he broke into laughter, but this was short lived, as a growl was heard in their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then proceeded to the buffet line, causing the crowd to cheer. Most of the patrons were no longer eating, as they were too fascinated by the two youngsters. One guy even ran up to Naruto, asking \"Hey, can I get your guys' autographs!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't know how to respond, and he was even a bit frightened, as the man was particularly loud. Another man broke this up by yelling, \"We're not here for autographs! We want to see you guys eat!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd had caused quite a bit of commotion, and the owner had to walk out to see what the commotion was. He wasn't surprised to see Naruto and Kiba there, and he even warmly greeted them, bellowing, \"My favorite patrons! How are you enjoying the free buffet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was about to respond, but his stomach growled loudly. That was the only answer that they owner needed, so he said, \"I guess you're still hungry, and I hear that people want to see you guys eat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at their table, with Akamaru laying on his back, stuffed to the brim. \"I don't want to have to see you guys take so many plates.\" Because of this, he decided to help them.</span></div></div>",

He bustled his way through the crowd and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba raised an eyebrow. \"Huh, whaddaya think he has in mind, Naruto?\" There was no reply from the blonde boy. \"Naruto?\" Kiba repeated, looking to where Naruto was standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde boy, orange hoodie riding up over his navel, currently had his finger wiggling about in the small pit, giggling up a storm. Kiba rolled his eyes. \"Never mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Blinking, Naruto looked up, his finger still in his belly button. \"You say something, Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFists on his hips, Kiba turned towards Naruto to retort, only to be interrupted when the restaurant owner returned, bearing a massive platter on each hand. Smiling, he handed one to each boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Naruto tilted his head, inspecting his platter; it was incredibly wide across, almost the size of half their booth table. In it, several large circular objects sat. \"What's this for, old man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering, the man gestured with his head towards Kiba, who was fiddling with the circular objects, a look of curiosity on his face. Suddenly, he hit some sort of switch, and he nearly fell off his feet when the objects sprung upwards, resting on struts in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto squinted. \"Wait a minute...those look like plates...\" His eyes widened, and he grinned as the implications dawned on him. Kiba wasn't far behind, if his toothy smile was anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner nodded. \"Those are our special Massive Course plates; they're usually meant for families...\" he winked at the two. \"...but I'm sure you two can use 'em just fine, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kids blinked, looked at one another, grinned, and darted back towards the buffet, moving at a surprisingly quick pace considering their somewhat stuffed bellies, and they were already loading up the multiple plate-like extensions with various goodies: fried chicken, ramen, ice cream, cake, gelatin, barbecued meat...pretty much everything the buffet had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few surprisingly long minutes, the two boys staggered back to their booth, their platters and the multiple plates stacked high with all manner of food. The crowd followed them, both awestruck at the sheer amount of food they'd gotten and curious to see whether they'd be able to eat it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, hearing the commotion, opened his eyes and looked as best as he could out of the booth. He whined as he saw Naruto and Kiba, navels already exposed, staggering back towards the table. <i>Oh, great...</i> Suddenly, his eyes widened and he let out a small canine burp, stuffed belly shaking. He whimpered; hopefully, Kiba would give him a tummy rub...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, even as Kiba plopped his massive platter onto the table and scooted into his seat, he looked at his buddy's stuffed tummy, smiled warmly, and scratched the furry sphere energetically. Akamaru, tail wagging wildly, kicked one of his legs as hard as he could, given the obstructing belly. Meanwhile, Naruto did the same, depositing his massive platter on the table and sliding in. Looking at the plates and rubbing his hands gleefully, he dug in, grabbing a chicken leg in each hand and ripping off chunks of meats, giggling at the moistness of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, noticing this, winced apologetically at Akamaru. \"Sorry, Akamaru,\" he muttered, lifting his hand away from the dog's tummy, much to the latter's disappointment. \"I'll give ya all the belly rubs ya want after this, I promise!\" Turning his attention to his own selection, he selected a couple pieces of cake, grabbing a fork in each hand and shoving hunks of it in his mouth at a time. Eventually, he moved on to a couple of rather sizable steaks, with Naruto turning his attention towards a large dish of vanilla ice cream with copious amounts of chocolate sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd watched as the two boys went at it, cheering loudly for the two as they stuffed their faces. As before, their bellies slowly but surely grew, forcing Kiba's shirt and Naruto's hoodie up a little higher with every few bites. They winced momentarily as they felt a tightness in their waistlines, but shrugged it off; the crowd was expecting a show, and they were gonna give 'em one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, through a mouthful of gelatin, giggled slightly, blushing a bit. <i>Heh...my tummy feels funny when it's growing!</i> He blushed harder; that was the second time he had thought or said \"tummy\" that evening. Still, considering what the extract did to them, he guessed it was to be expected. Shrugging, he swallowed the gelatin and tackled a dish of pudding with whipped cream instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, cramming brownie after brownie into his hungry maw, beamed as he felt his stomach grow heavier. <i>Hee hee, this is even more fun than I thought it'd be!</i> Swallowing and licking his lips to get rid of any crumbs, he grabbed a glass of milk and downed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed, and Naruto and Kiba had made good progress, though they weren't even halfway through yet. Their hoodie and shirt, respectively, had hiked up even further, and their stomachs had grown heavier in their laps, while at the same time inching dangerously close to the table. In addition, their waistlines were feeling even tighter than before; in spite of this, Naruto and Kiba never even slowed down, much to the delight of the cheering crowd; they might actually pull this off! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpurred by the cheers of the crowd, Naruto and Kiba pressed on, determined not to stop until every last speck of food on the platters were gone. As a result, their stomachs grew bigger and closer to the table, their shirt and hoodie continued to slowly rise up, and the pressure in their waistlines started to really be felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His stomach was then released, surging out and getting a couple of inches closer to the table. In addition, his shirt made its way to the top of his belly, and it popped off with the sudden force, resting on top of his stuffed belly. His zipper was also forced down a little bit, giving Kiba quite a bit of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Naruto yelled before a cunning smile appeared on his face. \"Maybe I can get Kiba back!\" He thought. \"Besides, it would feel awesome to break off this stupid button!\" Seeing the look on Naruto's face, Kiba knew that something was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right to be worried, as the crowd began chanting, only encouraging Naruto, who was currently chugging a large glass of milk in an attempt to break his pants button. Soon enough, a loud popping sound was heard, and the button was sent flying. It hit Kiba square in the belly while he was eating more sausage, causing him to yell, \"Ow! My tummy!\" He then flushed a bright red, as he realized what he just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was happening, Naruto's stomach, finally released from its prison, flopped out and continued to inflate ever so slowly with the milk that Naruto was drinking. The bottom seam of his hoodie ripped at the sudden force. From there it rode up off of his stomach, and rested on top just like Kiba's shirt. His stomach also forced the zipper of his fly down more than halfway, giving his stomach breathing room. Naruto finished the glass, burping, when he laughed at Kiba, saying, \"Admit it, I got you back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba couldn't help but begin laughing himself, and even the crowd started laughing after a tense silence. The two then remembered that they were busy stuffing themselves, and they got right back to it, causing the crowd to cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly everything imaginable was stuffed into the faces of the two boys. \"Man this food is good! I wanna see how big my belly can get!\" Naruto thought as he shoveled cake into his maw. \"I'm gonna catch up to Akamaru soon!\" Kiba thought before he glanced at Naruto. \"Man! Look at Naruto! He's really goin' at it!\" He thought, surprised to see Naruto with such a huge stomach, though he was not far behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir respective stomachs crept closer and closer to the table, and now their stomachs were putting pressure on various seams of their pants after forcing their flies all the way down. They felt air on their underwear, but no one could see their underwear as it was under both their bellies and the table.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto and Kiba, massive grins on their faces, continued shoving everything they could into their hungry maws. Noodles, baked goods, ice cream, cake, chicken, beef, pork...all of this and more vanished down their gullets and into their waiting bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, this caused their midsections to expand even more, further increasing pressure on the seams of their pants and moving ever closer to the table. Akamaru, still lying on his back, perked his ears up as he heard a very distinct creaking; it was the sound of straining fabric, and it was coming from both boys' pants. For what had to be the millionth time that day alone, he whimpered; yeah, no way this was gonna end well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba, for their part, were not oblivious to this either; they paused momentarily upon noticing the tightness in their seams, blushing slightly. However, they sprang back into action almost immediately afterwards, determined grins on their faces; it had felt awesome when they'd busted their buttons and the bottom seams of their hoodie and shirt, respectively, so they could only imagine how great it would feel once they'd busted a few pants seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, the food on the platters vanished, the boys' stomachs swelling in direct proportion to this occurence. Tighter and tighter their seams got, and closer and closer their bellies inched to the table, until, finally, with less than a quarter left for each of them, they made contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, feeling the cool table against his belly, looked down to see his gut touching it. He giggled at the sight. \"Hey, Kiba, lookit this!\" He prodded his stomach with a finger. \"My tummy's touching the table!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA goofy smile on his face, Kiba gulped down the last of a glass of soda and indicated his own stomach. \"Heh, so's mine!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both spent a few seconds giggling, feeling their stomachs and poking them, before they remembered they had an audience. Determined not to disappoint them, the boys fell to it with a renewed fervor, tackling what relatively little remained of their platters. With each bite, their stomachs pressed a little harder against the table, and their taxed pants seams became even more strained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as each boy reached the end of their platters with only one item left (a brownie for Naruto, a rather large roll for Kiba) and tossed those items in their mouths, chewing and swallowing, a tiny rip was heard, and both boys simultaneously sighed in relief as a tiny bit of their inseams ripped. The other seams that were being strained remained intact, but they became further taxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew!\" Kiba breathed, lying back and rubbing his stomach. \"That was really good!\" His distended midsection now pressed rather noticeably against the table, sitting in his lap. His shirt was resting on top of the large sphere, scrunching up the doggie face on it a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto burped and giggled, patting his belly happily. \"Yeah! That really hit the spot!\" His own bloated tummy pushed just as noticeably against the table as Kiba's, and, just as Kiba's shirt was, the bottom of his hoodie rested squarely on top of it. They both shivered as a draft played against their exposed but still out of sight underwear, amplified slightly by the small rip in their inseams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd stared at the two young boys, amazed at the size their bellies were, especially considering their own small size. Still, many of them couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed; they looked really full now, and didn't look up to eating any more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...which is why a shocked, excited murmur spread through the crowd as the boys gripped the table, grunted, and shimmied out of their booth, their stomachs making a light <i>plop</i> as they extricated themselves. Waving their arms about to balance themselves, they picked up their depleted platters and waddled back to the buffet, their stomachs shaking and wobbling as they did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they had fully restocked their platters, somehow managing to pack even more in than before, and lurched back to their seats. Once or twice they stumbled, almost dropping their heaping platters, but a member of the crowd would grab hold of their shoulders and steady them. Happily thanking them, the boys continued their lurch back to their seats until, finally, they'd arrived. Plopping the massive platters on the table, they squeezed back into their booths, grunting as their stomachs were wedged against the table. Regardless, they managed to get themselves back in their original positions. Gazing at the platters and rubbing their stomachs eagerly, both children licked their lips, gave each other an eager smile, and began digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To alleviate the pressure, he decided to turn to the side, facing Akamaru, who was nearly asleep in his stuffed state. Kiba gently scratched the dog's belly before he got an idea, his eyes lighting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took notice of this all, and he dropped his chicken leg, saying, \"What'r you doin', Kiba?\" Kiba then looked back at Naruto with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Naruto, I have an idea!\" Kiba started. \"What is it?\" was Naruto's excited response. \"Your tummy is probably starting to bug ya right about now, right?\" Kiba asked. Naruto nodded, saying, \"Oh, you want me to move it like you, right.\" As he moved his belly, adding, \"But how are we supposed to eat like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba then face-palmed, saying, \"No, that's not it, you idiot!\" Naruto was a bit angered by this, but Kiba continued, \"We can have a contest. Ya know, eat with our bellies forward. That way, they will keep hurtin' because of the table. Whoever can eat the most before they move their bellies wins!\" Naruto nodded excitedly, and began wedging his belly back into the table, with Kiba doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store owner, without much to do, as all of the customers were focused on the two, even decided to be the judge. He saw that Naruto ate a little more than Kiba, so he told Kiba to eat first, then when the two had the same amount, Naruto began eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the perfect competition for the two, as they were both very determined, and they both had high stamina and a tolerance for pain. It was amazing how similar the two were, which is why they got along with each other so well, and also why they butted heads so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two got at it, each trying to outdo the other and clean more of their platters. They ignored all of the various sounds and sensations as their stomachs stretched out to accommodate for the food that went down their maw, though much of it remained on their faces and torso garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, their inseams continued to rip, freeing more of their bellies. In addition, their navels popped out due to the pressure, though neither of them bothered to pay it mind, too focused on their own eating and ignoring the great discomfort. Their stuffed bellies grew slightly more forward, covering more of the top and bottom of the table as the divide in their bellies became larger. More noticeably, though, their bellies found room to their sides, opting to spread out sideways as they eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the table began to creak ominously, and the crowd, which was originally cheering, fell into silence in anticipation of whatever was about to happen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto and Kiba's distended bellies continued to swell, bulging out towards the top and to the sides of the table. Said piece of furniture continued to cut into their bellies, but they pressed on, determined not to lose to the other, even if their grins indicated that this was more of a friendly competition than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, more of their pants seams continued to pop, and the table creaked again, even louder than before. Kiba, hearing this, winced. <i>Hoo boy...if we go any further...</i> He looked to his side, where Akamaru, stuffed tummy sticking in the air, had finally dozed off. <i>Sorry, boy,</i> the little Inuzuka thought apologetically, gently grabbing the little dog and placing him within the neck of his shirt; with the dog's belly, he never would have been able to hold onto Kiba's head like he usually did. That taken care of, he resumed stuffing his face, his stomach continuing to press against the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely oblivious to what Kiba had just done, Naruto continued cramming food into his mouth, wincing as the table continued to cut into the ever-growing sphere that was his abdomen. His navel, peeking out above the table, wobbled as the appendage it was attached to continued to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boy's midsections grew bigger and bigger, the table creaked more and more, beginning to become a fairly constant noise. The store owner noticed this and winced, but he brushed it off; with all the publicity these two were generating, he'd be able to cover any damages easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as the boys' stomachs continued to bulge, the table emitted a loud, sharp, splintering noise. Kiba and Naruto, in spite of their stuffed states, heard this, grabbed their platters, and hoisted them above their heads. They did this not a  moment too soon, as the table caved inwards, splitting down the middle and collapsing to the floor. Kiba and Naruto's bellies, subsequently, surged forward, and the two boys let out audible sighs of relief as all the built-up pressure suddenly abated and their guts were freed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd gaped at the sight; whatever it was they had been expecting, that definitely hadn't been it. Without the table in the way, the kids' guts had flopped out, exposing just how big they had gotten. They stuck out at least a foot in front of the two, resting in their laps. Their upper torso garments, as before, rested squarely on top of the large spheres, luckily sparing them from any further damage; they were, however, dotted with food stains. Their pants, however, weren't quite so lucky; their inseams had torn extensively, and though their stomachs were resting in their laps, bits of their undergarments nonetheless peeked out from the sides. Naruto's was some sort of orange cloth, with currently-indistinct patterns on them. Kiba's, on the other hand, appeared to consist of brown cloth, with equally-unclear patterns on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the crowd's expressions, Naruto, still holding his platter, turned his head and blushed. \"Uh, sorry. We didn't mean to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was taken aback when the crowd erupted in cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That table never stood a chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys rock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the praise, Naruto and Kiba, slightly embarrassed as they were, couldn't help but beam, their blushes lighting up their smiles. \"Heheh, thanks!\" Kiba exclaimed, resting part of his platter on his massive tummy. Akamaru stirred, but remained asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto giggled. \"Thanks, but we're not done yet!\" He exchanged a grin with Kiba. \"Whaddaya say, dog-breath? You wanna give these guys one more show?\" He indicated his platter, which he was resting partially on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba licked his lips, looking down at his own platter. \"Ready whenever you are, dummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto only smirked at the insult. Shifting themselves and slouching down in their seats a bit so they could rest the platters entirely on their stomachs, they resumed gorging themselves, in spite of the massively-stuffed state of their guts. The crowd continued to cheer, eager to see how they'd prevail against this last platter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They finally finished, and they raised up their arms gloriously, not even caring that their stomachs were now touching each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd went absolutely wild, and there were murmurs of coming to the buffet again just to watch the two eat. As the crowd began dispersing, the two began to scoot out of their booths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both attempted to stand up, but as soon as they did, their destroyed pants fell to their ankles, reminding them of how much damage they had done. Either way, they had now sense of their new center of balance, so they both fell on their rumps, rubbing them before moving to the massive appendages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were so busy rubbing their bodacious bellies, attempting to alleviate the pain of stretching, that they were unaware of the few people that were left there that stared at their underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's underwear was a pair of orange briefs with a pattern of dancing ramen bowl. Kiba finally noticed this after a while, and he chuckled a bit before belching loudly. Naruto paid it no mind, but then he noticed what Kiba was laughing at, and he caught a glimpse of Kiba's undies, which were also briefs. The brown garment contained a pattern of dancing dog bones. Naruto then had his laugh, and the two fell into a fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the owner began cleaning up the destroyed table, Naruto and Kiba used each other for support, trying to stand and find their respective centers of balance. Their pants had no way to stay on them, so Naruto used Kiba for support while he picked up his pants. Kiba did the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they were both leaning on each other, lumbering in the direction of Naruto's apartment with pants draped over their shoulders. Akamaru was already asleep in Kiba's jacket, lulled by the slow, yet hypnotic motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had no shame as they walked throughout the village without pants. Luckily, it was later than they thought, and there weren't many people to give them weird stares. They even passed by Shikamaru, who took one look at the three and face-palmed, sighing and mumbling as he walked along. This only caused the two to giggle as they continued staggering to Naruto's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, they arrived back to Naruto's apartment, which was surprisingly clean, at least for his standards. Either way, Kiba asked, \"Do ya mind if I stay the night here? I don't think I can make it home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was excited to have someone stay with him as it was such a rare occasion. He immediately said, \"Sure! Make yourself at home!\" He even let Kiba and Akamaru have his bed while he slept on a mat on the floor next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was extremely happy, thinking, \"I have friends now!\" Before he fell asleep with a smile on his face. Kiba had left his jacket on for Akamaru, and he fell asleep hugging the young dog like he used to when he was younger.</span></div></div>",

Closing his mouth, which had been open as he slept on his back, he winced. \"Ugh...bright...\" Shielding his eyes, he groaned and sat up. Akamaru, still sleeping in Kiba's v-necked shirt, stirred, yawning widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at the noise, Kiba blinked open his eyes and looked down at Akamaru. \"Hey, buddy; you have a nice sleep?\" Wagging his tail, Akamaru barked an affirmative. Kiba, smiling warmly at this, rubbed his stomach through his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince last night's gigantic meal, his stomach seemed to have digested everything. It felt a little soft, but it was nothing a few walks couldn't burn off. As such, it had retreated beneath the article of clothing, and it was completely concealed, save for the hints of flesh that picked out of the busted side-seams. Kiba winced; he'd have to find another shirt until he could get that one fixed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden draft played across his legs, and Kiba, blushing, remembered that he and Naruto had shucked their pants last night, the ruined garments lying in a pile on the floor. <i>Speaking of which...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at the floor, and saw Naruto, wearing his slightly ripped hoodie and his ramen boxers, lying on his back with his arms splayed out to the sides. His stomach, though it had digested as well, was still exposed, as his hoodie still rode above it; apparently, the make of the hoodie had caused it to say scrunched up, even as the sphere that forced it up in the first place had vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shook his head, smirking and chuckling, before taking a look at the bedside clock. \"10:00 AM?\" He muttered in surprise, tilting his head. Not that it was that late, but he usually got up earlier than that. He was willing to bet Naruto did, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devious thought suddenly occurred to him, and he grinned viciously. \"Say, Akamaru...\" he began, looking down at the dog in his shirt. \"Ya wanna give the idiot a little bit of a wake-up call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately knowing where Kiba was going with this (he'd done it to him a few times in the past), Akamaru barked, leapt out of Kiba's shirt and onto the floor, and trotted up to Naruto's bare tummy. Wagging his tail, Akamaru leaned forward and put his wet nose on the exposed skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was almost instantaneous. \"GAH! Cold, cold cold!\" Eyes flying open, Naruto sat bolt upright, his hoodie falling down to cover the rest of his upper torso. Holding his midsection and panting from the shock, he looked down to see Akamaru, smugly wagging his tail. \"Akamaru, what was that for?!\" Realizing, Naruto looked up to see Kiba sitting on the bed, his expression just as smug as his dog's. \"Kiba...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed. \"What's the matter, Naruto? Ya didn't like the wet nose treatment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my tummy's sensitive!\" Naruto blurted out, blushing as soon as he realized what he'd just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed again, hopping off the bed and landing on his feet. He strolled over to Naruto, reaching out a hand. \"Ah, c'mon, Naruto, it was just a bit of fun; no need to be such a wuss about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScowling, Naruto nonetheless took the proffered hand and stood up. \"Yeah, fun for you, maybe...\" He suddenly noticed the sun and shielded his eyes. \"Wow, the sun's bright...what time of day is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smiled. \"10 in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Naruto exclaimed. \"Oh man! I was gonna get up at 8 and train! I just lost some of my day!\" He clutched his head. \"Oh man, oh man, I'm gonna fall behind and I'm never gonna become strong enough to become Hokage and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba facepalmed. \"Uh, Naruto...one day of not training ain't gonna kill ya.\" He smirked, gesturing at his and Naruto's de-aged bodies. \"Besides, don't ya wanna enjoy this for now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto paused in his panicking and looked at Kiba. \"H-huh? Whaddaya ya me---\" He looked down at himself, and promptly remembered that he and Kiba and de-aged themselves last night. \"Oh yeah, I forgot. Heh heh...\" he grinned sheepishly and rubbed the back of his head, prompting another facepalm from Kiba. \"Geez, you're such an idiot sometimes...\" he mumbled under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto heard this and scowled, but continued speaking. \"Anyway, Kiba...what didja have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shrugged. \"Eh, I figured I'd run around with Akamaru, maybe work off what's left from last night.\" He looked up at Naruto and smiled. \"You wanna come? We're going to the forest outside the village if you're interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's face lit up. Someone was actually asking him to spend time with them! The first time he was a kid, no one had ever asked him to do anything....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto? Are you <i>crying</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh?\" Kiba's incredulous voice snapped Naruto out of his thoughts, and he blinked, realizing that, yes, his eyes had started to well up a bit. \"N-nah, I just had something in my eyes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Whatever,\" he replied, good-naturedly. \"So, anyway, you wanna come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded. \"Sure!\" He looked down at his slightly-ripped hoodie and his ruined pants on the floor. \"Lemme just, uh, change into some new clothes.\" He began searching about his room for something to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt hearing this, Kiba brightened. \"Oh yeah, I almost forgot.\" He turned to Akamaru. \"Hey Akamaru; ya mind just running back to our place and gettin' me some clothes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked, nodded, and transformed into a copy of Kiba as he was now, wearing pants of course. He tilted his head at Kiba and barked a question. Kiba shrugged. \"Eh, whatever you can find.\" Nodding, the dog opened the window and bounded out; soon, he was leaping across the buildings on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a matter of minutes, he'd returned, holding a set of clothes in his arms. Kiba beamed. \"Thanks boy!\" Giving another affirmative bark, Akamaru handed his partner his clothes and transformed back into his natural shape. Giving the dog a ruffle on the head, Kiba began slipping into his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, both he and Naruto were clad in different sets of clothes that they had liked to wear as kids. Naruto was wearing a short-sleeved, black t-shirt with Konoha's symbol on the front. For his pants, he wore a pair of gray shorts that had a blue stripe going down the legs of both. Unlike his usual pants, these had no button or zipper, but were simply a pair of simple cloth shorts with a thick waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, on the other hand, was clad in a kid-sized net shirt, over which he wore a dark blue hooded sweatshirt that almost looked a bit purple (Naruto pointed this out with a giggle, much to Kiba's annoyance.) He wore a pair of long tan pants, and unlike Naruto's, had a conventional zipper and button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a look in the mirror and ensuring that they looked fine, Kiba grinned at Naruto, bending down a bit to let Akamaru hop on his head. \"So, ya ready to go, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding up his fists and beaming, Naruto nodded. \"Sure am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriding up to the open window, Kiba began climbing up on it. \"Well, what're we waitin' for? Let's go!\" With that, he was off, darting across the rooftops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Naruto climbed up to the window and jumped out, following the little dog-nin. \"Hey, wait up, Kiba!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon enough, after about an hour, Naruto, Akamaru, and Kiba found themselves in a forest outside of the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past hour, the three had jumped from building to building before leaving the village. There, Kiba let his nose lead him, going from smell to smell. Naruto watched, intrigued, as Kiba stopped on occasion, sniffed the air with Akamaru, then ran in a different direction, jumping from tree to tree, causing Naruto to rush to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, the hour of running had tuckered the three out, so they currently walked on the forest floor, panting. Akamaru had even crawled up onto Kiba's smaller head, though he could barely stay there given its small size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we goin' \" Naruto asked, his head cocked to the side a little. \"Do ya even know where Konoha is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm goin' wherever my nose tells me!\" Kiba responded simply, then he sniffed the air, grinned, then pointed to his left, saying \"It's over that way, slightly below us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuddup dog breath! I knew that!\" Naruto yelled back defensively. \"Whatever.\" Kiba responded sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began to bicker, but that was interrupted by a loud growling that came from Naruto's stomach. Kiba was about to make a remark, but then his stomach growled even more loudly. He then scratched his head, saying, \"I think it's time for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, with Kiba's nose leading them, the two began walking to the village, talking about the buffet and how awesome their situation was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all interrupted by Naruto screaming as a snare trap took him higher and higher by his foot. \"Help me Kiba!\" Naruto said frantically, beet red as he fell for the obvious trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I thought you saw that one!\" Kiba exclaimed, gigging at the sight of Naruto flailing, his shirt falling off of his abdomen, revealing his stomach, which was flat once again, just like Kiba's and Akamaru's thanks to the workout. Akamaru also laughed to himself, woken up by Naruto's outbursts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was about to help Naruto, but then he smelled food nearby, and went to investigate. Ignoring all of Naruto's yells, Kiba found the source of the smell, which was a crack that opened up under the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba tried to pry open the crack, which felt metal on the inside, but it shut closed, almost pinching his fingers, and Naruto was released, falling on his rump, saying \"Thanks for the help, Kiba\" with the utmost sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba then said, \"Wait, I think the trap is a switch, but you didn't open it enough.\" Kiba went to the rope to pull it down, but chakra enveloped the rope, and his hand burned a bit as he tried to touch the rope. \"Ow! That hurt. That's not gonna work!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then said, \"Oh.\", disappointed before the light bulb went off in Naruto's head, and he said, \"Wait, I have an idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he made a few hand signs, then said, \"Shadow clone jutsu!\", creating about a dozen Naruto clones, all identical to the seven-year-old Naruto. They soon formed a chain on the ground, reminiscent of the ones he formed to same others from falling off of cliffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top shadow clone then grabbed the loop of rope, which tightened around his hand, lifting him and the rest of the chain. The real Naruto was planted firmly on the ground, so he pulled on the chain, pulling the snare trap down. As this happened, the crack on the ground opened wider and wider, revealing itself as a thick, steel door that slid farther and farther open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the final clone was on the ground, keeping the snare trap down to allow the boys to slip into whatever was hidden behind the steel door. The three landed in a room the size of an elevator interior, and were quite cramped until the door above them closed, and a door to their right opened, revealing a warehouse size room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was filled with wooden crates of food. The crates had large labels that revealed their contents, and each one was surrounded by a lime-green aura. There was also a sticker on each crate that read, \"Sealed for freshness\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the room was well lit, and the three could see sunlight as they looked up. They wondered what kind of a jutsu could hide the warehouse like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarther in the room, as the three walked between rows of crates, they found a door. In this door was what appeared to be a small house. There was a kitchen with a table for dining, and there was an adjacent bathroom and a bedroom on the other side. The bedroom wasn't very furnished, only housing a bunk bed and a dresser for storage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three went back out to the main storage room to see a few other doors that led to more \"houses\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then broke their wondrous silence, saying, \"I wonder what this is all about.\" Kiba responded with, \"Probably an outpost for shinobi during a war, but who needs this much food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" Naruto replied, saying, \"I remember going on a mission to save Ayame from a few cooking nin. Maybe it has to do with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru then barked, saying, \"Nobody's here. How do we find out?\" Kiba replied, \"I dunno buddy.\" Of course to Naruto, this was strange, as all he heard was barking from Akamaru, and Kiba talking back. He stared at them with his head cocked to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are ya lookin' at?\" Kiba asked, forgetting that Naruto couldn't understand Akamaru. Naruto just continued to stare blankly. Kiba was about to snap him out of it, but Naruto's stomach growled again, snapping him out of it as he said, \"Whatever it is, I'm sure no one will mind if we eat something.\" as he rubbed the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets look for something to eat, then!\" Kiba exclaimed as he began to explore the room more, scanning the labels to find something good. \"These are all ingredients!\" Naruto complained, \"I can't cook! What should we do?\"</span></div></div>",

You do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded. \"Yep: Hinata gave me n' Shino cooking lessons, just in case we ever needed to make somethin' for ourselves.\" He grinned. \"She's an awesome cook, believe it or not, but I'm not as good as her.\" He continued walking about, sniffing and examining the boxes. \"Still, I should be able to whip up something...\" His face lit up as a lightbulb went off in his head. \"Actually, I can teach ya a few things, too; it'll make it easier on both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Naruto's eyes widened. \"You're gonna teach me to cook?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog-nin shrugged. \"Eh, why not? Not like there's anyone else here.\" He motioned for Naruto to follow him as he inspected the boxes. \"C'mon, I'll try to find something easy for ya.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking in confusion, Naruto nonetheless did as he was asked, following Kiba around and looking at the various labels on the boxes: noodles, spices, sugar, chicken...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's face lit up as they came to a box that read 'ground beef.' \"Ah, this should do just fine.\" Prying open the massive crate, he reached in and grabbed several packs of uncooked ground beef, sealed with something that looked like plastic but was probably a lot more durable; nothing was even leaking out. He turned to the other boy. \"Hey, Naruto, grab a few spices will ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking slightly disgruntled at being ordered around, Naruto nonetheless obeyed, striding over to a crate of assorted spices and cracking it open. \"Alright, but what're we makin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned widely. \"Only the best burgers you ever tasted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Naruto lifted the skillet and deposited the patty onto a plate, looking at it with satisfaction. It wasn't perfectly formed-in fact, it was uneven and lumpy-but the meat itself was cooked a golden brown, inside and out, and the aroma of the spices that had been added to it made his mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPer Kiba's instructions, Naruto had taken a rather large hunk of raw ground beef, shaped it a bit, tossed it in a skillet over a hot stove, and flipped it about, adding spices as Kiba told him to, until, finally, it was cooked to satisfaction. After making sure Naruto had it, Kiba had gone back into the warehouse to grab some buns and condiments. That left Naruto alone to make more of the burgers, and it hadn't taken long for him to come up with an idea. Making a series of hand signs, he materialized several Shadow Clones, and ordered them into a line across the stove, each one making their own burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Naruto decided they had enough to start, and dismissed the clones once they'd finished piling the burgers onto a plate. Licking his lips, Naruto grabbed the plate with both hands, struggling a bit under its weight, and lugged it over to the table, dropping it on the table. Nodding, he went to get two smaller plates for Kiba and himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rooted around in the cabinets, Kiba walked in, bearing an armful of burger buns. Akamaru, transformed beside him, carried an armful of condiments. Kiba's eyes widened as he saw the burgers. \"Oh wow, Naruto; hate to say it, but I'm really impressed!\" He sniffed the air, a goofy grin forming on his face. \"And I dunno what you did, but those smell AWESOME!\" He deposited the buns on the table, Akamaru doing the same with the condiments. Taking a whiff of his own, Akamaru grinned, transforming himself back into a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned, finding a couple of plates. \"Heh heh, thanks!\" Hopping off the chair he was using for height, he brought the plates to the table and set them down. \"Hope they taste good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips, Kiba grabbed a particularly large patty, slapped it between two buns, and squirted a copious amount of ketchup on it. \"Well, if they don't, at least the ketchup'll make it taste a little better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scowled, making a burger for himself and slathering it with ketchup and mustard. \"Well, in that case, you can be the first to try it, dog-breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba glared back. \"Fine, I will.\" Taking a seat, he dragged his plate in front of him, lifted the burger to his mouth and took a bite, juice running down his chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as he did so, his eyes widened. \"Well? How is it?\" Naruto asked, trying his best not to sound too hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba chewed for a few seconds before swallowing. \"Naruto...this...this tastes awesome!\" He grinned at the other boy, and Naruto couldn't help but feel a surge of warmth at the praise. He took another. \"Ya did real good, Uzumaki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, thanks!\" Naruto laughed, rubbing the back of his head and sitting down. Grabbing his own burger, he lifted it to his mouth and took his first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, a storm of flavors exploded in his mouth. Juicy beef, savory spices, soft bun... his own eyes widened. \"Oh, wow!\" Naruto exclaimed, spraying a few bits of burger about, much to Kiba's disgust. \"This IS really good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grimaced. \"Yeah, yeah, say it, don't spray it.\" He was unable to keep his annoyed expression up for much longer, however, and he broke out in another goofy smile. Opening wide, he took another big bite of his burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Naruto did the same, enjoying the flavors he'd created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since he ate the most, Kiba's belly was the biggest, lifting his hoodie ever so slightly, showing a thin sliver of net-covered flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba leaned back, put his hands behind his head and said, \"Man, Naruto! I never thought that you would be such a good cook! You finally found your hidden talent.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto replied excitedly, \"Yeah, and the shadow clones help me cook as much as we want! I wonder if I can cook anything other than burgers? I wanna try making something else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was glad to hear that Naruto was willing to make more food, and he said, \"There's still room in my belly! I can't wait! Let's look for ingredients!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two boys set off, though with a bit more difficulty due to their bellies, and they searched for ingredients to make something else that Kiba learned to make from Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to search through the virtual library of ingredients thinking of all of the possibilities.</span></div></div>",

Staggering under the sheer weight of all the items they held, the two nonetheless made it back to the kitchen and deposited everything on the table in a heap. Stepping back, they panted for a few seconds, attempting to regain their bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...OK, Kiba,\" Naruto panted, walking over to the ingredients, \"how do I make these things?\" Making a series of hand signs, he materialized several Shadow Clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping some sweat off his forehead, Kiba nonetheless grinned. \"Alright, Naruto, here's what ya do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba gave the instructions, Naruto and the clones obeyed to the letter, mixing ingredients, making the dough, rolling it, and adding the cinnamon as needed, with a few more working on the frosting. Eventually, they'd finished the first batch. Rubbing their hands together eagerly, Naruto and his clones placed their trays inside the oven, and immediately began working on the next batch of both rolls and frosting. When the oven beeped, Naruto simply materialized more Shadow Clones and had them take it out and apply the frosting. Kiba, standing in the background, took a deep whiff, a goofy smile appearing on his face and a bit of drool appearing at the corner of his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrooling a bit himself, Naruto nonetheless went about his work, making more and more of the treats and piling them on the table as they were completed. Within about a half an hour, dozens upon dozens of cinnamon rolls were piled upon the table, each looking amazing and smelling absolutely delectable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Naruto stared at the sight, mouths widened and drooling slightly. The dog-nin licked his lips. \"Oh man, Naruto...these smell as amazing as Hinata's!\" His slightly-stuffed tummy growled, and he rubbed it absentmindedly, not taking his eyes off the mounds of treats on the table. \"I bet they're gonna taste awesome, too!\" Without another word, he lunged towards the table, grabbing a couple of cinnamon rolls and cramming them into his mouth, his eyes lighting up as he chewed. Unable to help himself, Akamaru jumped off his head and began going to town on them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, briefly taken aback, rushed towards the table as well. \"No way, dog-breath! There's no way you're hoggin' everything this time!\" As the last word left his mouth, he too began cramming cinnamon rolls into his waiting maw, his expression mirroring Kiba's as he tasted them. For several, blissful minutes, the boys and the dog gorged themselves, lost in the sweet flavors of the confection.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This time, they ate about the same amount, but due to the earlier burgers, Kiba's belly was slightly bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, their bellies had lifted their upper garments about halfway to their navels. Naruto's belly was entirely exposed under his black t-shirt, but Kiba's belly was still covered with his net shirt, as the bottom seam of his shirt was elastic, and it refused to be lifted by the growing protrusion even as his hoodie was long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Naruto stood up, stumbling a bit as he did so. Kiba noticed this, left his food trance, and said, \"What's up, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just smiled goofily, replying, \"I'm thirsty, so I'm gonna fetch something to drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba then said, \"Good! I'm thirsty, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna come with?\" Naruto inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I don't wanna leave these cinnamon rolls!\" Kiba answered, an evil grin forming on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Kiba. I never knew you were such a pig!\" Naruto teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's face then turned red, and he responded defensively, \"You're one to talk! Besides, it's your fault for makin' the cinnamon rolls so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned smugly at that, and he ran off excitedly, searching for a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba took this opportunity to stuff his face, his stomach lifting his hoodie up ever so slightly more with each bite. Either way he remained oblivious as Naruto arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, Naruto wasn't alone, as he, and about a half dozen more clones were hefting a large crate that had a seal that said, \"Refrigerated\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and his clones then took the crate next to the table, within both boys' reach, and they dropped it, surprising Kiba, who flushed with embarrassment upon being discovered eating more cinnamon rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was quite annoyed, but he opened the crate, grabbing a large jug of ice-cold milk and placing it on his side of the table. \"I brought milk!\" He exclaimed before taking a few large gulps straight out of the jug. He then proceeded to devour more cinnamon rolls, as he didn't want to miss out anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shrugged, and grabbed a jug himself, taking a few swigs before he tore back into his side of the massive pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than twenty minutes, Kiba and Naruto had finally finished the pile. Naruto's stomach had lifted his shirt just above his navel, and the waistband of his shorts began to stretch. He was nearly able to catch up to Kiba, but Kiba still ate quite a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's belly was quite a bit larger, as it had lifted his hoodie a couple of inches above his navel. The bottom of his net shirt still stayed below his belly, and the area in front of his belly began to stretch, creating squares of flesh that stuck out in between the strings of fabric. His pants weren't doing so well, as there was considerable pressure on his pants button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had finished the cinnamon rolls, but they had only drank about one and a half jugs of milk each, and there was plenty still left in the crate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was rubbing his belly unconsciously before he got an idea of how to deal with the milk. He asked Kiba...</span></div></div>",

I wasn't ready!\" Scowling, he lifted the jug to his lips and began glugging it. Naruto, seeing this, scowled in return and picked up the pace, chugging the rest of the jug as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a matter of minutes, they had completely emptied their respective jugs. Without missing a beat, Naruto created a couple of Shadow Clones and had them push the crate forward, so it was within easy reach for both of them. With this taken care of, they reached over, grabbed a new jug each, and began going to town on it. The thick, savory liquid flowed down their throats and into their bellies, which, owing to their already-stuffed states, slowly inflated, almost like water being poured into a balloon. And, as the boys finished their second jugs and went on to tackle their third, fourth, and fifth jugs, their bellies continued to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's stomach grew and grew, slowly stretching his waistband further as it pushed forward and grew heavier and heavier in his lap. In addition, his t-shirt slowly slid further up, slowly exposing more skin above his belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's hoodie, likewise, hiked up higher and higher, moving even further above his belly button. His net shirt, though it still covered his belly, was starting to show strain; the engorged flesh of his belly was pressing hard against the netting, bulging out between the empty spaces of the garment even harder than before. In addition, more strain was being put upon his pants button, and Kiba winced as a bit of pain shot through his waistline. However, he pressed on, determined not to fall behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys continued going through the crate, and their bellies continued to grow, forcing their upper torso garments up higher and growing heavier in their laps; their legs were even beginning to become forced apart. Naruto's waistband continued to stretch, and his shirt continued to ride up. Kiba's hoodie continued to rise up, and his belly pressed even harder against his net shirt; in fact, some of the strands of netting were beginning to fray. In the meantime, his pants button had begun to get unbearably tight, and was now starting to quiver under the pressure. Feeling this, and knowing how it was likely going to end, Kiba nonetheless narrowed his eyes, tilted his current pitcher up (which still had half of its contents left), and began chugging like he'd never chugged before. The pressure in his waistline and in the area of the net shirt that surrounded his belly increased exponentially, but Kiba shrugged it off. More and more he chugged, until, finally, there was only a large mouthful left. Grinning wildly, Kiba tilted the pitcher back and gulped down the last of the milk...and set off a small chain reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, his pants button, no longer able to take the strain, popped off, shooting off and beaning Naruto in the nose just as he finished his own jug. He spluttered, but managed to keep the majority of the milk in his mouth. With this bit of extra room, his tummy surged forward a bit, just enough to strain his net shirt enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRRIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...to split a part of it open; specifically, the area around his navel. As a result, while the rest of his engorged belly was still covered by the net shirt, his bare belly button and a decent amount of skin around it now exposed itself to the world--or at least to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a bit, Kiba nonetheless grit his teeth and seized another jug, beginning to down it just as ferociously. Naruto, wincing and rubbing his sore nose, still grabbed another jug; he'd kick Kiba's ass for that button thing later...</span></div></div>",

He shrugged and returned to his jug, watching Naruto the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto paid no mind, as he was too busy concentrating on breaking his waistband. Kiba watched in awe as Naruto's stomach pushed out visibly, lifting his shirt all the way off and putting considerable strain on his waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was still drinking milk himself while he did this, so the ring of intact threads around his belly began to strain. They gave away soon, but Kiba soon found out that the snapping of his net shirt was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's stomach had already surpassed Kiba's by now, and now it was being bisected by his elastic waistband, which made slight tearing sounds as it began to break down thread by thread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the waistband would have no more, and it snapped violently, causing a loud crack that even woke Akamaru up. Kiba was startled even though he was expecting it, and Naruto placed his nearly empty jugs down, smiling at Kiba smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snapping of Naruto's waistband caused a chain reaction. First, his stomach flopped outwards violently, wobbling profusely as it did so. A large tear down the front of Naruto's shorts was created in it's wake, and it surged outwards like a tsunami, smacking against the table, causing Naruto to wince slightly after his smug smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the two were back at it, grabbing more jugs and downing them, though Naruto went back drinking one at a time. Even through all of this, the crate was still slightly over half full.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At this point, Naruto and Kiba began to slow down; the combination of burgers, cinnamon rolls, and milk had begun to take their toll on the two youngsters. As a result, instead of glugging the milk down enthusiastically, they sluggishly gulped it down, wincing a bit as it surged into their already-overfilled bellies. Naruto's stomach pressed a bit harder against the table as he drank more milk, and Kiba's belly slowly got closer to the table as he drank. In addition, the little dog-nin's zipper slowly slid downwards as he drank his milk, gradually opening his fly in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after they'd finished a little over half the crate, Naruto and Kiba let their arms drop to their sides, the empty pitchers falling out of their hands. \"Ooh...so much milk...\" Naruto groaned, letting his head tilt back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, groaning, nodded. \"Maybe...maybe drinking so much wasn't such a good idea...\" His sentence was suddenly interrupted by a rather queasy-sounding burp. Groaning again, he let his own head tilt back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning, Naruto replied, \"It...seemed like a good idea at the time...\" Suddenly, he yawned widely. \"Mmm...I'm feelin' kinda sleepy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out another burp, Kiba ran his tongue along his lips. \"Yeah...me too.\" To punctuate this, he let out a loud yawn of his own. \"I'm just gonna...rest my eyes for a second.\" He let his eyes fall shut; within a matter of seconds, he was snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping, Naruto sighed. \"Sounds like...sounds like a plan, Kiba.\" He shut his eyes, and soon, he was snoring just as his friend was, a tiny bit of drool collecting at the corner of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning himself, Akamaru struggled to his feet, fighting off his own sleepiness to take a better look at the two sleeping boys. Kiba's hoodie now rode completely over his belly, and nearly all of the net shirt that had covered his belly had busted, letting his swollen, bare tummy hang out for everyone to see; at this point, only the elastic bottom and the netting covering the chest remained intact. In addition, his pants button was missing and his fly was partially undone, giving a glimpse of white through the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's shirt, like Kiba's hoodie, rode completely over his engorged tummy, exposing the appendage in its entirety (miraculously, both his and Kiba's navels were still in their natural shape of pits). His shorts had a rather sizable tear down the middle, giving a rather distinct glimpse of green. His stomach pressed against the table, but not so much that it was squished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru rolled his eyes, but seeing them like this--small, sleepy, and full--gave him a funny sensation in his chest, and not an unpleasant one. Deciding to sleep on it, Akamaru dropped to the table and rolled onto his back, stuffed tummy wobbling. In a matter of minutes, he, too, was blissfully slumbering away.</span></div></div>",

Man, I'm starved!\" Naruto exclaimed as he rubbed the sleep out of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it!\" Kiba replied before saying, \"Hey, do you wanna make something? You are the good chef here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled at the compliment and said, \"Nah, I wanna take it easy. Let's see if they have premade food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded in agreement, and he woke up Akamaru, telling him to come with them. Akamaru was tired though, and grumbled, \"I need my sleep!\" Kiba rolled his eyes, and he decided to pick up Akamaru, and lay him down in the front of his hoodie like he used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru settled back in, falling asleep quickly as the two boys set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's hoddie had fallen back down to its normal position, covering his torn net shirt and the small bulge that barely made itself visible. He had zipped up his pants, and luckily, that was enough to suffice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had more difficulty, on the other hand. They were going fairly slowly because Naruto was holding up his shorts the entire time, as his waistband had snapped, and that left a giant tear on the front. He was able to cover his underwear, though, so Kiba couldn't get in a few laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, on one side of the giant room they found a huge pair of double doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could we have missed that!\" Kiba blurted out, waking up Akamaru, as he set his eyes on the massive door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just ignored him, as he was currently struggling to open one of the doors. Seeing this, Kiba decided to help, and the two youngsters pushed on the heavy door with all of their might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the door had given up, and it slowly fell backwards. Unfortunately, this sent the two tumbling onto the ground, as they were using the door for balance. The two tumbled over each other, and wound up on the floor, with Akamaru jumping out of Kiba's hoodie just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, since Naruto's shorts were torn so much, and he wasn't hanging on to them, they slid down to his ankles, resting on his sandals, revealing his undergarment, which was a pair of small, green boxer briefs, which were speckled with various ramen fixins, including the fishcake that shared his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba began laughing hysterically at that, standing up in the process. When he stood up though, his pants fell slightly, and the zipper, weakened from all of the strain, fell downwards, loosening his pants enough to allow them to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Naruto got the laugh, as Kiba's underwear was a pair of white briefs with various anthropomorphic cartoon dogs plastered all over it. Naruto was laughing hysterically as Kiba blushed, but soon enough, Naruto pulled up his pants, and went up to Kiba, punching him in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was comforted by that, and he pulled up his own pants, smirking. The two finally saw just what the room contained as they turned around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The boys eyes widened as, true to their hopes, the room was filled practically to the brim with crates. As their eyes moved over the crates, scanning their labels, grins formed on their faces, which only continued to widen as they found each successive label: Candy, ice cream, potato chips, soda, cupcakes... In spite of the fact they were still digesting what was left of their massive meal earlier, their stomachs growled. Naruto, licking his lips, held onto his shorts with one hand, rubbing his stomach with the other. \"Oh man...I don't know where to start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, hiking his pants up a bit for safety, continued scanning the crates. \"Yeah, me neither; it all sounds good...\" his mouth abruptly shut as his eyes fell upon a crate labeled \"jerky\". Notably, Akamaru's eyes bugged out as well. \"On second thought, I know exactly where to start.\" He rushed towards the crate. \"Dibs on the jerky!\" Akamaru, barking happily, followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Naruto continued scanning the room, eventually selecting a crate labeled \"fudge\". Hands holding up his ruined shorts, he made his way over to the crate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Kiba had reached the crate of jerky, he grabbed the edge and, with a mighty grunt, dislodged the top...and immediately began drooling at the sights and scents that met him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crate was filled to the absolute brim with jerky, which looked tough and chewy-just the way he liked it. In addition, judging from the fresh smell, it was almost as though they'd just been made. \"But that's impossible,\" Kiba thought, scratching his head. \"Unless...\" He took a closer look at the outside of the crate; sure enough, the same green glow that had surrounded the ingredient crates permeated this one as well; evidently, it was meant to preserve freshness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba reached in to grab a couple handfuls, but upon seeing just how big the crate was up close, he got an even better idea. Grin lighting up his face, he took a few steps back. Akamaru raised an eyebrow. <i>Uh, Kiba? What're you....</i> The dog swiftly got his answer as Kiba ran towards the crate, grabbing onto the rim as he got close and hauling himself in, plunging into the jerky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's eyes widened. <i>Did he just...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, Kiba's head abruptly shot up, poking out of the crate. \"Well, c'mon, Akamaru, what're you waitin' for?\" Grunting, he shifted and moved until Akamaru could see his shoulders and chest. Grinning, the boy leaned forward, stretching out his arms for Akamaru; just how big WAS the crate? Regardless, the dog was never one to turn down free jerky, so it was with an eager leap that he bounded into Kiba's outstretched arms. Laughing, Kiba brought his arms in, burrowing back into the jerky. Akamaru, jumping out of his arms and hopping on top of the jerky, gaped; the contents of the crate were covering everything but Kiba's head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing at Akamaru's expression, Kiba dove into the jerky, coming back up with a large mouthful. \"C'mon, Akamaru!\" he urged through a mouthful of jerky. \"What're ya waitin' for? There's plenty!\" Freeing one of his arms from within the small sea of jerky, he retrieved a huge handful and crammed it in his mouth. Wagging his tail, Akamaru burrowed down into the jerky, popping his head up a few seconds later with his own mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, who had at this point simply been eating the fudge (which was delicious, by the way) directly out of the crate, noticed what Kiba and Akamaru were doing. \"Huh, that's not a bad idea,\" he thought, swallowing his current mouthful. \"Maybe I'll give it a go...\" Getting close to the rim of the open crate, he clambered clumsily over the top and landed with a thud in a veritable sea of fudge. Wincing, he nonetheless beamed  at the sight, and submerged himself, burrowing into the fudge and taking huge mouthfuls.</span></div></div>",

Naruto chose to make a sort of pit for himself, then he sat in the pit, grabbing handfuls of fudge that were piled around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ate, his stomach pushed out steadily. Like always, his shirt could only handle so much of his belly, and it began rising. Soon enough, he was sitting in the bottom of the box, rubbing his overfilled belly, which had since lifted up his t-shirt all of the way. It now rested heavily on his lap, extending about halfway to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kiba ate, he chose a different method, digging under the beef jerky, grabbing anything in his way with his mouth. With his Inuzuka teeth, jerky wasn't nearly as difficult to chew for him, as he tore through it easily. Either way, he laid on his back at the bottom of the pile of jerky, shoving the pieces that remained on top of him into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru took a different approach, resting at the top as he ate any jerky within reach of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, both of their bellies expanded quickly as they gorged themselves with the cured meat. Kiba's hoddie rose, and his stomach pushed outwards quickly, finding space in the hole in the front of his net shirt. He prepared ahead of time, unzipping his zipper all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's furry belly made its way towards the floor from his standing position. Soon enough, it reached the floor and began spreading his legs apart. Finally, just as his legs lost contact with the ground, he gave up, allowing Kiba to finish the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kiba was done with his stuffing fiasco, leaving his stomach in a similar state to Naruto, though on a slightly smaller scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow finished with their first crates, the two clambered out of them, looking for the next ones to dive into. They were both thirsty, and they thought about finding something to drink before and while continuing the stuffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto saw a crate that read \"cookies\", looking in to find all sorts of cookies stacked in the box. He also saw a crate that read \"juice\" that contained all sorts of fruit juices. He thought, \"I'm thirsty, and I could use some juice, but cookies are delicious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba saw a create that read \"meat snacks\". He peeked inside to see segments of meat sticks filling the crate. \"That's just down my alley!\" He thought. He also saw a crate that read soda, seeing a variety of different sodas on the inside, \"I am parched, though...\" He thought as he considered his decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were indeed quite similar, as they were about to make similar decisions.</span></div></div>",

To this end, they both began lurching towards their respective crate, bellies wobbling as they did so, Naruto still holding up his shorts. Akamaru, absolutely stuffed to the brim from the jerky, simply flopped onto his back and closed his eyes, eager to resume his nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the boys reached their crates. Licking their lips, they reached out and pried the tops of the crates open, revealing their contents. Naruto, within his crate, saw a variety, massive bottles of all different sorts of juice: apple, cranberry, grape, pineapple...his eyes lit up, and he tried to decide what to drink first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, likewise, saw a variety of bottles as large as Naruto's, except with different sorts of sodas: regular, orange, root bear, grape, lime, ginger ale...he bit his lip, indecision warring inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, both boys came to a decision: Naruto seized a bottle of apple juice, Kiba a bottle of root bear. Twisting the caps off, they lifted the bottles to their lips and started chugging. Almost instantly, their bellies began expanding, pushing out further as the sweet liquid flooded down their gullets. As their midsections grew, their knees buckled a bit, but they managed to remain standing. Soon, their first drinks were finished, and they tossed the empty bottles aside. They reached inside for another bottle, but they stumbled forward, only steadying themselves by grabbing onto the rims of the crates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba quickly realized the problem: if they kept drinking at this rate, it would become harder and harder to reach into the crate to get more drinks. Almost as soon as this thought entered their heads, an idea occurred to them. Smirking mischievously, they reached in with both hands, pulling out bottle after bottle and setting them on the floor around them. Eventually, they had it set up so that the remaining contents of each drink crate surrounded them. Nodding happily at their work, they each bent down and retrieved another bottle. As before, their stomachs swelled, and their knees continued to buckle. Finally, they gave way, and they each plopped flat on their rears. Unperturbed, they continued chugging, their bellies crawling more and more towards their knees. Once they'd finished their second bottles, they immediately reached out and grabbed another, and immediately recommenced chugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally, both boys had finished off their crates, and were contentedly popping their fingers in and out of their mouths, attempting to get any crumbs they may have potentially missed. In the meantime, they tenderly massaged their engorged midsections with their other hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's t-shirt, in spite of resting on top of his belly, had begun straining at the bottom seams. More noticeably, though, the rips in his shorts that had begun branching off from the main rip (which had grown even further in size) had increased in both length and width, reaching towards the legs. The stomach itself easily filled the space between his midsection and knees, and his legs were starting to get forced apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's belly, on the other hand, had ripped his net shirt open even further, allowing his stomach to flop even further out and start to force his own legs apart, much like Naruto's was. At this point, nearly all of the front of his net shirt was split open, fully exposing his bare tummy; the only parts still intact were the threads covering his chest and the very bottom; however, even that elastic part of the net shirt was starting to get stretched to its limit. His pants, in spite of the fact that they were fully unzipped, were beginning to strain at the part where the zipper rested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lying down for a few minutes and resting, they finally decided that they were still hungry. Reaching their arms up and grabbing onto the edges of their crates, they hoisted themselves upright, and, with great difficulty, hoisted themselves out of their respective crates. They cried out as their overstuffed bellies caused them to stumble forward, but Kiba managed to reach out and hold onto his belly before it could cause him to topple over. Naruto, getting an idea, spread his legs as far apart as he could to keep his ruined shorts up and used his arms to support his belly as Kiba was. Balancing themselves as such, they looked about the room, eager to find something else to eat. It didn't take them long; Kiba sighted a crate of apples, while Naruto's eyes fell upon a crate of assorted candy. Licking their lips, they slowly set off towards the crates, Kiba lurching, Naruto waddling. Once they'd reached their chosen containers, they pried the tops off and clumsily struggled over the edge, their bellies making it very difficult to do so. Eventually, though, they fell with a plop into their selected foodstuffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing and rubbing the back of his head, Naruto noticed, to his delight, that all the candies were unwrapped. Stretching his arms and legs out as far as they would go, he grabbed handfuls of all kinds of candy and shoved them in his mouth, chewing gleefully. As the candy entered his stomach, the bottom seams of his shirt continued to strain more, and the new rips in his shorts creaked and slowly expanded themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, taking a similar tactic, grabbed an apple in each hand, taking huge bites out of each and discarding the cores, only to pick up two more and repeat the tactic. As he went through the apples, the elastic band of his net shirt continued to stretch, creaking audibly; it had never been made for this sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, once he'd racked up a dozen apples, it could take no more; with an almighty CRACK, his net shirt's elastic band finally snapped in two down the middle, the broken band of elastic lying beneath Kiba and sticking out to the sides. As it did this, his belly flopped even further outward, putting further strain on his undone pants. As a result, his zipper was forced down past the end of his fly, ripping his pants a bit. Kiba winced, but continued eating, determined not to let this small setback keep him from enjoying his crate of apples.</span></div></div>",

He laid on his back, his shirt's bottom seam had given out in the process, and the rips on his shorts were ever so slightly larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two didn't want to move, but they knew they had to, and after struggling to make it out of their respective boxes, the two gingerly made it back to the door that led to the room with raw ingredients. They merely exchanged looks, having a mutual understanding of their conundrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Akamaru had waken up a bit earlier, and he had been watching for the past ten minutes. Not wanting to strain Kiba any farther, he remained on the floor at Kiba's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing each other for support, the two stumbled along, trying to remember where the room that they slept in was. They made their way through the rows of crates, and if they disagreed on which direction to go, one of them would surprisingly submit, too tired and nauseous to argue otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto broke the silence by jokingly saying, \"Looks like you ate well, Kiba.\" The three chuckled a bit, and the group soon arrived at...</span></div></div>",

Akamaru, stowed away safely in Kiba's hoodie, was already dozing, sleeping off the effects of his massive meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling and groaning all the way and leaning on one another, they slowly made their way to the bed. Groaning, Kiba reached up, grabbing the edge of the bed and struggling to get on top. Finally, he managed to clamber up, and promptly rolled onto his back, engorged belly sticking up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at him, feeling conflicted; on the one hand, he wasn't sure how he felt about sharing a bed with Kiba, even if it wasn't for anything weird; after all, there were other beds in this place. A bolt of pain through his belly, though, reminded him that he was sick, tired, and he really wanted to sleep. Therefore, he reached up and clambered on top as well, opting to lay on his side away from Kiba. His belly stuck out in front of him, and he tenderly massaged it, trying to alleviate some of the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Naruto?\" Kiba spoke up suddenly, his eyes closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, Naruto replied, \"Yeah, Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little dog nin followed this with a yawn of his own. \"This has been really fun, but what're we gonna do about clothes, even after our guts go down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping, Naruto blinked. \"Whaddaya mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba yawned again. \"Well, let's see; my net shirt's ripped, my pants are busted, your shorts are so ripped you hafta hold them up to keep them from falling down....Even after everything digests, what're we gonna wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought about this for a moment; that actually was a good question...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea occured to him, and he grinned. Making the necessary hand signs as he laid down, he created a non-stuffed Shadow clone, but this one was wearing a white t-shirt with a stylized flame symbol on the front and blue-black trousers. Rolling it's eyes, the clone went out of side and tossed its shirt and trousers off, leaving only its sandals and boxers. Grinning and thanking the clone, Naruto allowed it to dissipate; however, the clothes it had discarded remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, hearing the commotion, blinked open his eyes and looked over. \"Huh, not bad, Naruto,\" he admitted, unable to suppress a smile. \"Could you, uh, maybe do one for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Naruto replied brightly, summoning another non-stuffed clone that was wearing the same garments as the one previously. Nodding, the clone held up its hands, ready to make the signs for the Transformation jutsu. The original turned towards Kiba. \"So, what clothes would ya like?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba thought about it for a  moment, then told Naruto, who told his clone. Nodding again, the clone transformed itself into an exact, non-stuffed copy of Kiba, albeit one wearing a tan, long-sleeved shirt with dark patches on the elbows and dark blue shorts that buttoned, unlike Naruto's current pair. Walking out of sight, the transformed clone repeated the process its predecessor did, shucking its garments and leaving only its undergarments and sandals. Naruto dismissed this one as well. \"That should take care of that,\" Naruto nodded happily, before he yawned. \"We can put 'em on when we wake up. G'night, Kiba.\" He closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba rolled his eyes. \"It's afternoon, dummy...\" he began, before he heard Naruto already snoring. He smirked. \"Ah, what the heck; g'night Naruto.\" Laughing, he closed his eyes, and soon he too was sleeping.</span></div></div>",

Naruto sat up, and he looked around to see that Kiba, whose belly was practically non-existent save a thin layer of fat, was currently changing. Kiba took no notice of him, as he slipped on his new shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then rubbed the sleep out of eyes, inspecting his own belly to find a bit of pudge from eating all of the cookies and a lot of candy last night, not to mention the burgers, cinnamon rolls and milk. If it wasn't for his metabolism thanks in part to the nine tails, Naruto's stomach would have been much larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, as Kiba put his sandals on, Naruto began changing himself. \"Looks like someone finally woke up!\" Kiba remarked. Naruto just replied, \"Your hair says that you just woke up too.\" Kiba, a bit embarrassed, started fumbling with his hair, trying to fix his bedhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably get back to the village.\" Naruto pointed out. Kiba replied, \"Yeah.

There was another matching switch on the other side, and a the door above them opened. They climbed out using a ladder, and Kiba and Akamaru began sniffing the air looking for the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wier\" Naruto began before Kiba interrupted him, pointing in a direction and saying, \"That way.\" The three ran in that direction, and, soon enough, they found themselves on top of a ledge overlooking the village. To the right, they could see the famous Hokage monument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two were walking through the village again, thinking about what to do.</span></div></div>",

Sliding into it, they made themselves comfortable, called a waiter over, and each ordered the single biggest item the restaurant had. The waiter's eyes bugged out; only the Akimichi kid had ever ordered that monster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the customer was always right, and the waiter, with a reluctant affirmative, had left the table, leaving the two boys to eagerly chat and discuss what the item could possibly be to elicit that kind of reaction out of the man; after all, they hadn't even looked at the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir question was soon answered by the arrival of their dishes, at which point their expressions echoed the man's previous one. Each of them had received an absolutely massive dish of rice, complete with two heaping plates of various cuts of meat: beef, short ribs, pork, chicken...all of this was present and ready to be cooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me, um, know if you boys need anything else,\" the man muttered, scuttling away from the table before the boys decided to take him up on that offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither boy moved: for a few seconds, all they did was gape at the massive dish of rice, then at each other, then at the huge plates of raw meat, then back to each other. Akamaru, though he was shocked as well, simply sighed as he perched on Kiba's head; this was going exactly how he thought it would. All that was missing was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost on cue, the boys looked at each other, grinned, and split their chopsticks. With alarming speed, they ladled copious cuts of meat onto the grill in the center of the table, and followed that by practically spooning the rice into their mouths as they waited for the meat to be cooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, given that he enjoyed rare meat, only gave his meat enough time for it to be just cooked enough before lashing out with his chopsticks and forking piece after piece into his mouth. Grinning and closing his eyes, he chewed reluctantly, a bit of bloody juice dribbling down his chin, much to Naruto's disgust. He distracted himself by cramming more rice into his mouth, and continued to do so until his cuts of meat were cooked to satisfaction. Licking his lips, even though he already had rice in his mouth, he lashed out with his own chopsticks and put several pieces in his mouth, chewing and giggling at the tastes and sensations of the rice and the meat mixing together. As he chewed, he put more cuts of meat on the grill, even as Kiba did the same. Seeing how Naruto reacted to eating the rice and meat together, he forked a great deal into his maw, waiting a minute or two before his meat was cooked enough for his tastes, then crammed the cuts into his maw. He chewed...and his face promptly lit up. <i>Oh, wow, this is good!</i> Kiba thought, chewing happily even as he prepared more meat. <i>Naruto actually had a good idea for once!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys continued on in this manner: forking rice into their mouths, cooking the meat, forking the meat in alongside the rice...as the minutes ticked by, Akamaru thought he saw the levels of both the rice and the meat start to go down, but just barely; there was a huge quantity of both. <i>This is going exactly where I think it is, isn't it?</i> he whined, covering his eyes with his ears.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nearly everyone was surprised when they heard the announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cola?! But that's a drink, not a food!\" Naruto exclaimed, flabbergasted. Nearly everyone had a similar reaction of surprise, but they didn't express it like Naruto did, though Kiba did have a similar outburst, saying, \"I thought this was a food festival!\". Akamaru merely laid on his back, panting from the last round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Kiba and Naruto were deciding which of them should go. Kiba said, \"I have an idea! Let me go! Besides, I ate a while ago and I have plenty of room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\" Naruto replied skeptically. He was unsure of what Kiba was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Kiba was sitting at the table with Naruto next to him. Both of their bellies were quite distinguishable under their shirts. Naruto's shirt had even risen just the slightest bit. Either way, Kiba was soon presented with six half-gallon pitchers of cold soda. There was no ice in it, but the pitchers rested in a deep tray filled with ice to stay cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your plan?\" Naruto whispered to Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna drink the soda...\" Kiba began before quickly being interrupted by Naruto, who screamed \"What?! That's not a plan!\" causing Kiba to recoil, covering his ears with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, let me finish!\" Kiba yelled. Soon enough, he had Naruto's attention, so he whispered, \"When I take a breath, help me burp. It would be easier than me forcing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto understood, and the light bulb went off in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba then lifted up one of the large pitchers, tipping the spout into his mouth and guzzling rapidly. After about thirty seconds, a time which impressed nearly everyone, he had gotten about halfway through the pitcher, and he took a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he did so, Naruto slapped him on the back as hard as he could, causing Kiba to break into a fit of coughing mixed with burping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that for?!! I'm not a baby!\" Kiba yelled after he had maintained his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it worked with normal-sized people, too!\" Naruto protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gas is in my stomach! Push it out from there you idiot!\" Kiba exclaimed, exasperated as the two were losing precious time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeved, Naruto yelled, \"I don't wanna touch your stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit being a baby. Do you wanna win or not?\" Kiba responded, surprisingly silencing Naruto, who simply nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Kiba was back on a roll, and he was near the bottom of the pitcher when he went to take another breath. As soon as he did so, Naruto pushed on Kiba's distended stomach, forcing a gargantuan burp out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the two began to gain momentum. Kiba finished the last pitcher, burping nearly immediately afterwards thanks to Naruto. Then he swiftly moved on to the next pitcher, his stomach beginning to lift his shirt at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time Kiba drank, his stomach would start advancing forward noticeably, and when he took a breath, Naruto pushed on his stomach, causing it to retreat slightly as he burped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the second pitcher, Kiba's stomach had lifted his shirt up about an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third pitcher brought it up another inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth brought Kiba's shirt just up to his navel, and his stomach began pressing uncomfortably on his pants button, but he was too focused on drinking the soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifth fully revealed Kiba's belly button, and as he finished that pitcher, and Naruto had \"burped\" him, he patted his belly proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kiba was on the sixth pitcher. Because he was fairly out of breath from the first five, he couldn't last as long, and it took five installments to finish this pitcher. When he did so, his shirt rested about halfway between his belly button and the top of his belly. Naruto squeezed out one final burp, one which shook nearly everything on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon afterwards, the announcer yelled, \"That's time!\", signifying that the round was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was tempted to stand up, but he was too exhausted, so he just laid back in his chair, panting while Naruto began working more of the gas out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man Naruto. *Burp* I know this is *Burp* weird to say, but *Burp* you're really good at helping a man burp.\" Kiba mentioned with a satisfied grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, thanks.\" Naruto awkwardly replied as he continued to knead Kiba's belly, which sloshed around as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba soon sat up and Naruto took his hands away. Kiba said, \"Man, this feels really weird\" as he grabbed his own belly and sloshed it around. He was then reminded of the pain of his waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then began struggling with his pants button, trying to work past his belly to unbutton it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help you.\" Naruto offered, seeing Kiba's predicament. He then pushed Kiba's belly back while Kiba undid the button, freeing the appendage slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you didn't want to touch my belly!\" Kiba mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then replied, \"I was just helping a friend\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so, the announcer chimed back in. \"It's time for the next round, and that is...\"</span></div></div>",

He was so worried about making sure that Naruto and Kiba would be taken care of that he forgot to try discovering what could have caused this predicament in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Shikamaru said, \"I forgot. How troublesome. I should take care of that soon.\" He then formed the classic hand sign for the Shadow Clone Jutsu, and a Shikamaru clone appeared right next to him. \"This will make it easier on Akamaru. Oh, and feel free to take some of the new clothes I brought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're leaving already?\" Naruto complained childishly as his eyes began welling up with tears. \"Don't worry, Naruto. I'll still be here.\" The Shikamaru clone assured as he approached Naruto and patted him on the head gently. Naruto then hugged the Shikamaru clone, and Kiba soon followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru then left, and he began gaining intel from the kitchen, intel that lead him to a group of Sound shinobi that was operating just outside the village. He then grumbled, \"This doesn't sound good. I don't know if I can handle this by myself. How troublesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the hotel, the Shikamaru clone was back to watching his show about puzzles while Naruto and Kiba began bickering about the clothes, leading to a small tussle between them. \"How troublesome.\" Shikamaru mumbled as he went to break the two up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that time, they were both crying out on the floor. Shikamaru wasn't much of an emotional person, and he didn't know how to respond. Either way, Naruto clutched onto Shikamaru as Kiba was comforted by Akamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, like all little kids, Kiba and Naruto bounced back quickly, and they began chasing each other around the room, giggling as if they had never been mad at each other. Soon enough, the Shikamaru clone returned with news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so this was caused by Sound Shinobi.

Kiba loved to watch it as a kid, and he suddenly felt the urge to watch it again, so he decided to show it to Naruto. Akamaru, in Kiba form, was laying on the bed like a dog, diligently watching over the door and the window. Shikamaru was glad that they didn't get any younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food was still there, and it was covered up with dish covers. The carts were heated, so the food stayed warm in case they needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're finally here! It's about time\" Kiba exclaimed, as Akamaru went back into his normal form with another poof of smoke. \"Yeah, we're gettin' hungry here!\" Naruto complained, patting his distended stomach, which surprisingly growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of their stomachs were actually quite soft instead of taut, indicating that their stomach still had quite a bit of room left in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you dressed, first.\" Shikamaru responded, gesturing to the bags of clothes that he just bought. Kiba and Naruto agreed, and soon, Kiba was wandering to the bathroom, his arms overflowing with a pile of clothes that he haphazardly grabbed from the bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, he exited, clad in a red t-shirt with a large dog bone printed across the chest that rested on the top of his stuffed belly. (Shikamaru knew that Kiba would love the shirt) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also wore a pair of tan pants that were not zipped up or buttoned to make room for his belly, revealing the front patch of the new white briefs with various dog-related patterns on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Naruto's turn to change, and he emerged from the bathroom with a plain orange t-shirt and a pair of matching orange pants with black trim. His clothes were undone like Kiba's, revealing his pair of white briefs that had patterns of ramen bowls and chopsticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Kiba and Naruto were demanding food again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you eaten enough already?\" Shikamaru inquired, patting Naruto's distended belly. \"I guess, but we always eat like this!\" Naruto complained. \"Yeah, and our bellies always go away after we're done!\" Kiba argued, backing Naruto up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru sided with Shikamaru, but both of them soon realized that Naruto and Kiba would not give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How troublesome.\" Shikamaru mumbled in his typical, annoyed manner.

If he was aware of this, he gave no indication; rather, he simply continued attacking bowl after bowl, his stomach pressing harder and harder against the cabinets, wedging himself in further in the process. All the while, his shirt continued to inch upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, noticing this, had picked up his pace, going through ramen bowls faster than he ever had before. As his result, his belly, formerly a few inches away from the cabinets, swiftly made contact, and only pushed harder and harder against the surface as he continued gulping down bowl after bowl. His shirt, as with Naruto's, hiked up higher and higher, revealing his belly button in short order and, in short order, going up even higher. Within a matter of minutes, he was keeping pace with Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru closed his eyes and wagged his tail smugly; even if ramen was Naruto's favorite food, there was no way he'd ever REALLY be able to beat Kiba...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of straining fabric snapped him out of his reverie, and he refocused his attention on the two competing boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears perked up. Where was that noise coming from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then he remembered; neither Naruto nor Kiba had bothered to undo their pants, and the tortured articles of clothings were now on their last legs, trying to hold fast against the ever-growing spheres of flesh pressing against them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whimpered, settling back down on his pillow and covering his eyes with his ears. <i>Oh, this ain't gonna be good....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba both winced as the pressure around their waistlines became unbearable, but they pressed on, neither willing to give an inch. Meanwhile, their pants buttons quivered violently, before, finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir pants buttons, unable to take any more pressure, burst off the fronts of their pants, striking the lower part of the counter and ricocheting, hitting them in their feet in the process. This small pain, however, was overwhelmed by the overwhelming sense of relief that came from their bellies finally getting more room. Predictably, they surged forward, wedging themselves even further in to their seats. While all this was going on, their flies were both forced down partway, though they still had a ways to go. Kiba and Naruto sighed in unison, grinning dopily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, that feels so much better...\" Kiba moaned. He blinked, refocusing a bit. \"But how...\" His eyes widened as he realized that the pressure around his waist had suddenly abated. Reaching a hand under his belly, he blushed as he felt around his pants. \"Ah, great, I blew my button out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked over at him and laughed, until he felt an odd draft. \"What the...\" Confused, he reached under his belly, and soon began blushing as Kiba had. \"Ah, crap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching this, Akamaru ventured a question at Kiba. <i>So...is the contest over?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kiba's head whipped towards Akamaru. \"You kidding, boy? No way! I'm not losing to this knucklehead!\" Turning to the shocked Teuchi and Ayame, he raised an arm. \"Oi! Keep the bowls coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, shocked out of his embarrassment by Kiba's exclamation, grunted and raised his arm. \"M-me too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru sighed, settling back down. Nothing else he could really do, anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you want to go from here?</span></div></div>",

They mindlessly stuffed themselves silly, trying to outdo each other in terms of pure ramen consumption, completely unaware as their stomachs continued advancing under the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the copious stuffing, the bellies of the young shinobi were stretched quite a bit. Soon, their exposed navels, which were actually hidden under the counter, began to shake slightly, the pressure causing discomfort in the competitors, though they were too occupied to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the pressure was too much, and with a strange popping noise, Naruto's navel, which was originally a small pit in his abdomen, had inverted, becoming a small nub that stuck out due to the sheer pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed in relief, gaining a look of confusion from Kiba, who felt the same sensation moments afterward. He followed suit in sighing. When he did so his belly moved, rubbing against the cabinet under the counter, and, due to the sensitivity of his new protruding navel, it tickled the small nub that was his belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis other sensation was too much for Kiba who began to giggle. Naruto, who had stopped as well, asked, \"What's so funny?!\" In doing so, he moved his own belly, tickling himself in his bellybutton on the cabinet underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, both boys were in a fit of giggling, turned to copious laughter. Akamaru was completely confused, as the two most stubborn shinobi in existence, who had just been eating furiously, staring at each other with daggers, were now engaged in a feat of laughter, with their stomachs comically large, wedged under the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeuchi and Ayame were also puzzled by this sudden change in the boys' behavior. Teuchi was relieved, as the two boys had eaten a huge portion of his supply. He chose the wrong time to wait to stock up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, as suddenly as Naruto and Kiba had stopped to laugh, they glared at each other for a moment, then they simultaneously tore into their current bowl of ramen, each of them finishing their respective bowls in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys continued their binge as if they hadn't stopped, and with each bowl, their bellies, having no room to push forward, began to advance out on either side of them along the underside of the counter, filling more and more space under said counter.</span></div></div>",

Finally, unable to handle any more pressure, the seams started to bust apart. If they noticed, the gave no indication, and they continued to stuff their faces. Akamaru continued to gape; only the seams on their sides of their shirts were being compromised, so it wasn't like they were going to rip off, but to see them taking such a beating was...weird, to say the very least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winced as he felt his stomach tighten and fill out under the counter, but he pressed on. No way was he going to let Kiba beat him at his own...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...was something touching his stomach?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, he snaked his arm under the counter, feeling around the bulbous sphere his stomach had become...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead snapping up, Kiba swallowed his noodles and glared at Naruto. \"Mind tellin' me what the hell you're doing, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto looked at Kiba, glaring in return. \"What are you talking about, dog breath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kiba growled. \"You're touching my gut, dumbass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, Naruto tilted his head. \"Huh?

He absentmindedly massaged the massive protrusion of his midsection, fully sated by his massive feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stared on awkwardly, wondering why Naruto wasn't as embarrassed as he was, and his leaning back soon caused his stomach to pop out from under the counter, sending him falling backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, he was able to catch himself, and he held on to the counter, letting the stool fall as he positioned himself in a standing position. He sighed in relief, as his stomach, which was around the same size as Naruto's was freed, and he had a center of balance again, thanks to the help of the counter. Either way, Akamaru couldn't help but chuckle to himself at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught Naruto's attention, and soon, the two made eye contact again, their faces flushing deep red yet again as they remembered their recent encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the two turned away from each other, and Naruto managed to stand up, again using the counter to balance himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to face away from each other as they struggled to reach their respective wallets to pay for their respective meals. They forgot about the challenge because they were so embarrassed. Naruto, being Naruto, affectionately stroked his frog wallet (which was as stuffed as he was) with his finger as he got the money to pay for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was over, the two began to let go of the counter, each of them waving their arms in an attempt to find their centers of balance. Akamaru was giggling again, with Kiba becoming more embarrassed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the two were slowly but surely waddling towards their homes, struggling to maintain balance, ignoring strange looks in their concentration. Because their pants buttons were gone, they both had to hold their pants up with one hand, balancing with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you have to laugh back there?\" Kiba inquired to his trusty ninken, offended that his best friend just ridiculed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru replied simply, \"It was pretty funny, and I was laughing at Naruto, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true. He is such an idiot sometimes!\" Kiba replied, cheering himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, both pre-teens had found their respective apartments. Kiba was especially glad that his mother and sister had gone on a mission together earlier that day, giving him the house alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering his house, Naruto managed to remove his sandals, trying to work around his belly in the process. He also discarded the destroyed shirt and slipped out of his pants, an easy task as they were already unbuttoned. Clad in only a pair of orange plaid boxers, he then lumbered to the couch and collapsed, lying on his back, and he quickly fell asleep, despite it only being 4 in the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba hadn't bothered to undress upon his arrival, only removing his destroyed t-shirt. He merely plopped himself on the nearest couch, laying in much the same fashion as Naruto, rubbing his belly with a queasy expression on his face. He was still proud of himself, and couldn't help but feel that way as well. He also melted into a solid slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Naruto's eyes eased open as he took in his surroundings. His hands, which were originally resting on his gigantic tummy, had since migrated downward as digestion occurred, and now they rested on a tiny potbelly that was currently there. His stomach had stretched out considerably, and there was a small layer of fat covering his abs, though that could be easily worked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was still quite tired, and he laid on the couch for a while, listening to the mid-morning sounds of birds chirping, basking in the sunlight that flooded into his apartment. He also basked in the fact that he still had no missions, and he was free to train or just relax at home.</span></div></div>",

They were, essentially, a larger version of some clothes he had liked to wear as a young child. Comfy to wear, and nice for a bit of light training...they would do nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping on the pants, Naruto zipped them up and, with a bit of struggle, buttoned them; they were a bit snug, but nothing that couldn't be fixed once he fully worked off his massive meal. Then, grabbing the shirt, he slipped it on and pulled it down. His stomach pressed against it slightly and somewhat noticeably, but it nonetheless remained confined underneath the article of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at himself and smirking in satisfaction, Naruto walked over to his door, where he had thrown his sandals.

The long trip and the near constant stream of bandits was exhausting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe burst into his house, ready to sit down and relax for once, and he found a note on the dining room table. \"Awesome!\" Kiba exclaimed, \"We get the house to ourselves, buddy!\" He burst out because he just found out that his mom was busy tracking down a missing-nin, and his sister was in a nearby village, watching over the village's farms, which recently had some of their cattle stolen. It was quite important, as those farms were where much of the village's food supply came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Akamaru barked happily in response, settling on the arm of the couch, basking in the early summer sun. \"It's nice to have my summer coat!\" Akamaru thought as Kiba patted his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, on the other hand, removed his jacket, as he was starting to feel too hot, leaving him in just his fishnet undershirt. He was pretty hungry, so he began rummaging around the cupboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk made its presence known on Kiba's face as he found a box filled to the brim with homemade jerky. Beef, turkey, chicken, and even pork jerkies were present. His sister had recently learned the family recipe for each jerky, and was practicing until she got it just right. This left a lot of leftover jerky, as his mom refused to sell jerky that wasn't perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a dog clan, the Inuzuka's loved meat, and because of this, they had a tradition of making various meat products for the village, and their meats even became somewhat of a tourist attraction in Konoha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Kiba was glad that he could have all this extra jerky, so he eagerly lugged the box over to the kitchen table, though Akamaru didn't really notice, as he was already asleep. Taking a whiff of the spices and meat, Kiba figured that the smell would soon wake up his best friend.</span></div></div>",

Ears perking up, he sat up in his perch, his gaze falling upon the box of jerky on the table. His tail began wagging, and his mouth fell open. <i>Ohhh...that smells so good...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTensing his legs, Akamaru leapt off the arm of the couch he'd been resting on and rushed towards the scent and into the kitchen. As he came into the room, he saw Kiba retrieving a large handful of jerky from the box. His ears perked up even more. <i>Homemade jerky!</i> Barking and yipping happily, Akamaru bounded up to the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, the jerky halfway to his mouth, turned his head and looked down to see his buddy at the base of his seat, barking and practically hopping in place. Laughing, Kiba set the jerky on the table and held his arms out towards the floor. \"Heh; don't worry, buddy, I didn't forget about you.\" Barking happily, Akamaru hopped into his arms. Sitting back up, Kiba deposited the tiny dog onto the table. Barking in thanks, Akamaru snapped up a piece of beef jerky and began gnawing on it happily. Smiling at his friend's contentment, Kiba reached into the large box with both hands and retrieved two more huge handfuls of jerky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping them onto the table, he grabbed a piece in each hand and ripped off about half of each in one mouthful. He spent a few seconds chewing the halves before he crammed the remaining halves into his mouth. He chewed for a few more seconds before swallowing. Licking his lips, he grinned. \"Beef and pork...oh yeah.\" Grabbing a few more pieces of jerky-this time with a few in each hand-he took big bites of each of them, throwing the remainder in his mouth and repeating the process. All the while, he savored the myriad tastes that came to his tongue: beef, chicken, pork, turkey...mixed together with the spices with which they'd been treated, it created a mixture of flavors and textures that left Kiba hungry for more. As such, he picked up his pace; grabbing more at a time, going through them quicker...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, likewise, had become delighted with the different flavors, and began ripping off big pieces of jerky at a time. In the back of his mind, he felt a bit nervous-he knew how this could end, after all-but he just couldn't help it. It all tasted so good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later and several piles of jerky later-which still left the box with a great deal more than half of its original contents-Kiba and Akamaru let out satisfied burps. Leaning back in his chair, Kiba licked his lips and patted his belly. \"Mmm...Hana really outdid herself this time, huh, Akamaru?\" Feeling it to be oddly curved, he looked down at his stomach, even as he patted it. It had begun to round out a bit, beginning to push very slightly and almost invisibly against his fishnet shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, lying down his side, glanced down at his own stomach. It had begun to fill out, rounding out the tiniest bit. <i>Yeah; we're gonna hafta ask what her secret is.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed, retrieving another big handful and depositing it on the table for the two of them. \"Sounds like a plan. For now, though, let's go on!\" He popped an entire piece of beef jerky into his mouth. \"This is too good to pass up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru sighed. <i>I can't believe I'm saying this, but...</i> He got to his paws and attacked another piece of jerky. <i>Let's go!</i></span></div></div>",

He opened them to find more meat products, uncooked sausage, meat sticks, and other cured meats.

Akamaru, stumbling to his paws, gaped at them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Uh, Kiba,</i> he started, staring at the gallons of liquid on the table, <i>I'm thirsty too, but don't you think this is overdoing it a bit?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Kiba ruffled Akamaru's head. \"Nah, it's fine; we've still got a ton of this box left, and I found a bunch of other meat in the fridge! We're gonna need all this if we're gonna tackle that, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's eyes bugged out, going to the box of jerky on the table-still filled at least halfway-then to his friend. <i>Please tell me you're joking,</i> he whined. <i>I mean, we're already halfway through, and...just look at your stomach!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, Kiba looked down. \"Huh? My stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba had gorged on the jerky, his stomach had started to push out more, taking on more and more of distinctive round shape. In addition, it now pushed far more visibly against his net shirt, and it appeared as though he were hiding some sort of lump underneath the piece of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Akamaru's dismay, Kiba merely grinned and smacked his belly. \"Ah, relax, Akamaru! We've got a few days off, and you know how fast my metabolism is; what's the problem with letting loose every now and then?\" Without waiting for Akamaru's answer, he plopped back in his seat, reached into the box, and retrieved another handful of jerky, cramming the whole thing into his mouth and chewing rapidly, smiling dopily at the tastes that came to his mouth. He spent a few long seconds chewing before he grabbed a gallon of apple juice, popped the top off, and brought the whole thing to his lips, tilting his head back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru watched, awed, as Kiba used the initial influx of juice to wash the jerky down, then continued to chug the gallon like there was no tomorrow. At the behest of some sudden urge, his gaze went to Kiba's midsection. To his shock, it seemed to swell as the liquid entered it, the lump underneath his net shirt growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity, he slammed the now empty jug onto the table. Belching rudely, he wiped his sleeve across his mouth. \"Ah, man, that hit the spot!\" Standing up suddenly, he made his way over to the cabinets, retrieving several extremely large bowls. Bringing them back to the table, he set them down and filled them each with either juice or milk. Laughing good-naturedly, he pushed them all towards Akamaru, ruffling him on his head and setting more jerky in front of him as he did so. \"Here ya go, buddy; drink up!\" Making his way back over to the fridge, he retrieved yet more milk and juice, bringing it back to the table, popping the cap off a gallon of milk, and proceeding to chug it as he had the juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching in wonderment as Kiba's belly slowly swelled as the thick liquid entered it, Akamaru managed to tear his gaze away, eying the juice, milk, and jerky in front of him instead. He spared another glance at Kiba, his jug almost depleted and an arm already reaching towards more jerky. Akamaru gave a resigned sigh. <i>Well, we are on break...</i> He looked again at his treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Screw it; I'm parched, anyway.</i> This thought in mind, Akamaru trotted towards one of the juice bowls and began lapping it up. His tail began wagging. <i>Mmm...grape!</i> He began lapping it up with more enthusiasm, ripping a bite out of his jerky every now and then. As he tackled more of the jerky and drinks, his stomach began growing at a slower pace than Kiba's, but he did not let up. Meanwhile, Kiba was still going full-stop on his jerky and drink, his belly continuing to swell as cured meat, juice, and milk were crammed into it.</span></div></div>",

With each bite of jerky or gulp of drink, his belly pressed harder and his shirt. That was nothing, though, compared to his pants, the button of which was quivering violently, threatening to pop off at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's belly continued to expand as well. He looked beyond pregnant as his belly pushed closer and closer to the floor. It also pushed on his legs quite a bit the more he ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kiba reached his hand into the box to grab more jerky, but his hand wasn't successful in his search for more, and he exclaimed, \"We finished the whole box, buddy!\", proud of their accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru couldn't help but feel proud as well. <i>That was nothing!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba then stood up, and the sudden shift in his weight caused his belly to sway, and that was the final straw for his shorts, the button of which popping off and ricocheting out the window.

Like Kiba, his massive meal of jerky, milk, and juice had mostly run its course, with only a curved little tummy to show for it. Kiba chuckled as the sunlight played across Akamaru's face, causing him to twitch and awaken. <i>Mmm...wha?</i> Yawning widely, Akamaru flipped over onto his belly, resting his head on his paws. <i>Man, I slept great...</i> Sensing Kiba, he looked up and wagged his tail. <i>Mornin', Kiba; you sleep good?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sprang to his feet, stretching. \"You bet I did!\" He strode over to the table and gave Akamaru a pet, much to the dog's delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How much of that do ya think was the jerky?</i> the dog asked, causing Kiba to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno, buddy, but considering how good we slept, I ain't complaining.\" Almost on cue, Kiba's stomach let out a growl. Blushing a bit, he put a hand on it, smiling. \"That reminds me; it's morning, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting his head a bit, Akamaru, nonetheless wagged his tail. <i>Yep; whaddaya ya wanna do for breakfast?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFolding his arms, Kiba closed his eyes. \"Let's see; we could just have something here...\" He opened his eyes and grinned. \"...but this is my day off; I wanna go wild.\" He let off a little \"heh!\", showing off his sharp canines. \"I got some cash to spare, so let's go get somethin' out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru yipped excitedly, getting to his paws. <i>Sounds good to me!</i> His eyes went down to Kiba's lower body. <i>First, though, could ya put some clothes on?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly remembering he was only wearing his boxers, Kiba blushed and scratched the back of his head laughing nervously. \"Oh yeah...heh heh.

As he planned to do some exercise that day, he also wore a net shirt underneath. \"Alright, ya ready to go, buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTensing his legs, Akamaru took a running start, leaping off the table and into Kiba's arms, where he was tucked comfortably into the hood of Kiba's hoodie (which, at the moment, was resting on his shoulder.) <i>Let's go, partner!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving his partner an appreciative ruffle, Kiba darted towards the front door, opened it, and dashed out into Konoha's streets.</span></div></div>",

Kiba was even told stories about the immense servings that they have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly located the place, Akamaru being a bit nervous, and he excitedly burst in, ready to have a big breakfast as he was taken to a booth by a waiter. Everything looked clean and new, and the morning sun shined warmly through the adjacent window.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba gaped as he looked through the menu. \"Holy...is this for real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting against the dread rising in his chest, Akamaru looked at the menu from his perch on Kiba's shoulder. In short order, his expression was mirroring Kiba's. <i>Oh, you've gotta be kidding me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach and every item on the menu, from the biggest meal to the smallest side, was served massive proportions. Whether it was a twelve-stack of pancakes, two waffles with eight scoops of ice cream with all the fixings sandwiched between them, a six-egg omelet with all manner of meat and other such fillings crammed in, or even bacon stacked at least three plates high, this place didn't do anything halfway. What was more, each individual pancake, slice of french toast, waffle, what-have-you was ridiculously big, at least if the pictures were anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba continued to scan the menu, a waiter came by. \"Hello, sir. What can I get for you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked up at the waiter. \"Um, hold on a sec...\" He flipped through the menu for a few more seconds. His eyes widened as they fell upon a particularly huge item. <i>Ah, what the hell; I have a few days off.</i> \"Can I get the Daimyo's Breakfast Feast?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's eyes bugged out, but the waiter only chuckled. \"Feeling hungry today, are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit sheepish, Kiba rubbed the back of his head, smiling. \"Yeah, I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter chuckled, scribbling something down on his notepad. \"Very good. And what would you like to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kiba looked over the menu. \"Uh, I'll just do milk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded, scribbling a final note down on his pad. \"Excellent! I'll be right back.\" He gave Kiba an apologetic look. \"And, erm, in regards to the size of the meal, it'll have to be delivered to your booth in several servings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Kiba leaned back in his seat, arms resting on the back of it. \"It's OK; I don't have anything big planned, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man beamed. \"Excellent! The first portion should be out shortly.\" Turning around, he bustled to the kitchens to put Kiba's order in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the man had left, Akamaru whined, rubbing up against Kiba's cheek. <i>Kiba, I really don't think this is a good idea. You might make yourself sick if you try to down all that.</i> Kiba smiled warmly, touched by his best buddy's concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, he could understand why Akamaru was worried. After all, the Daimyo's Breakfast Feast was nothing to scoff at. It consisted of sixteen slices of french toast, eighteen pancakes, five waffles with ice cream slathered generously over them, seven scrambled eggs with copious amounts of cheese melted over it, ten slices of toast, and two plates of bacon and sausage that he could only assume would be overflowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Akamaru,\" he replied, scratching the tiny dog's ears. \"Trust me, if I can't eat it all, I'll just take the rest home.\" Akamaru breathed a sigh of relief, his tail wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tail abruptly stopped wagging when Kiba grinned cockily and declared, \"But I'm sure as hell gonna try to eat it all!\" Akamaru simply whined at this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his friends head, Kiba settled back into his seat, waiting for the first course to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to wait long, as a few minutes later, another waiter came up to his table, pushing a laden cart along and drawing the gasps of the other patrons. Kiba noticed the reactions first, wondering what the big deal was...right until the plate was plopped down in front of him. His eyes widened comically. \"Whoa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSituated in front of him was the massive stack of eighteen pancakes, towering well above his head and already dripping with syrup and butter. And, as Kiba had suspected, each pancake was ludicrously big, each one at least the size of an average pizza (he'd gotten one a few weeks back, so he would know.) Akamaru said nothing, simply staring at the monstrosity in a combination of terror and awe. A second plate was set to the side, so some pancakes could be set aside to allow Kiba some access to the top of the stack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, the waiter retrieved two more items from the cart and plopped them next to Kiba; one was an empty glass, absolutely huge, while the other was a massive pitcher of milk. \"Th-the next platter should be along shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Kiba mumbled, only half-paying attention as he sized up the massive stack. Somehow, he didn't think that would be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding breathlessly, the waiter towed the now-empty cart away, almost dreading what would be loaded on it next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Akamaru spent the next few minutes gaping at the stack of pancakes before them. Then, Kiba took a deep whiff. \"Oh man, that smells <i>awesome</i>!\" Pushing some of the pancakes off the stack and onto the second plate, he grabbed the pitcher and filled up his glass, licking his lips at the mighty stack (about eight pancakes) that still sat in front of him. \"Hope it tastes as great as it smells!\" Grabbing his provided fork and knife, he ripped off a huge chunk and placed it in his mouth, chewing. His face lit up as the pancake seemed to melt in his mouth, and a combination of savory sweet flavors assailed his tongue. Gulping it down, he grinned at Akamaru. \"Man, these are <i>amazing!</i> Ya wanna bite, Akamaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog shook his head. <i>M-maybe in a bit, but I'm good right now.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shrugged good naturedly. \"Alright; tell me when you want something.\" Without further preamble, he dove back into his pancakes, savoring every bite even as he gulped them down, taking intermittent swigs of his milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba's consumption of the pancakes was quite a sight to behold. He would use a knife to cut into the top of the pancakes, then he would make his way all the way to the bottom, until he essentially cut of a stack of eighteen pieces. He then grabbed the top half of the stack in one hand, grabbed the other half in the other hand, then stuffed them one by one into his maw, smiling cheerily as he chewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued this process until he had half of the pancakes gone. At this point, his stomach was distended quite considerably, lifting his hoodie almost to his belly button, revealing a wide strip of net-covered flesh. At this point, however, the structure of pancakes had become less sound, and Kiba barely saved it from falling over, the situation attracting some mildly interested looks from others in the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba disregarded this, as he held the portion of the stack that almost fell, which was the top six half pancakes. Shrugging, he took bites out of that mini stack, barely able to open his jaws enough to fit it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough he finished that, then finished the last twelve in much the same manner as he did when he first started. He patted his now larger belly in a satisfied manner, the appendage having lifted up his hoodie almost all the way to the top of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba waited for the rest of the meal, it became quite clear that he wouldn't quite be able to finish it all. As Kiba thought about this, the food settled in his stomach, making him feel full at first, but his stomach slowly stretched to accommodate as he waited, relieving the pressure and giving Kiba a new drive to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came half of the bacon and sausage, with the waiter placing two considerable platters on the table, each piled high with their respective meats. The waiter politely asked, \"How's the meal so far?\" Kiba merely belched in response, smiling. The waiter chuckled at this saying, \"Glad you're enjoying yourself! Let me know if you need anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba looked at his platters, though, he remembered that he probably wouldn't be able to do it alone, and decided to eat as much as he can, then take the rest home if necessary.</span></div></div>",

His fingers had just come within reach of the bacon when he heard the door to the diner open. Akamaru's ears perked up, but Kiba just shrugged and continued to reach for the bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe I let you drag me here, Konohamaru...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's eyes widened, and his hand once again stopped. \"Naruto?\" He wondered, looking towards the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, there was the blonde genin, clad in a white t-shirt with a stylized flame symbol (not to be confused with Konoha's symbol) on the front, back, and sleeves, along with a pair of blue/black trousers. Beside him, a young boy with goggles on his head and a scarf around his neck, turned to him and looked up, folding his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, I told ya, you can't eat ramen all the time. And besides, um...\" He laughed nervously and rubbed the back of his head. \"Uncle Asuma's on a mission right now, and I kinda feel weird eating by myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhapping the boy lightly on the back of the head, Naruto turned away and folded his arms, grumbling. \"Could be eating Ichiraku's right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru stopped rubbing the sore spot and grinned at Naruto. \"Ah, don't be like that, boss; I've heard this place has really awesome breakfasts!\" Scanning the restaurant, his eyes settled on a certain very surprised dog-nin and his ninken. \"See, that guy seems like he had a really good meal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scanned the diner. \"What? What guy are you...\" Konohamaru pointed, and Naruto followed it. His eyes widened. \"Eh? Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Kiba waved. \"Hey, guys.\" Akamaru barked a greeting, wagging his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing Kiba's swollen, net-shirt-covered belly, Naruto made his way over to his booth, not even waiting to be seated; Konohamaru followed close behind. \"Damn, Kiba, what did you eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba burped, grinning. \"Oh, just eighteen pizza-sized pancakes; it's the first course of the Daimyo's Breakfast Feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened. \"Th-that was the first course?!\" His eyes fell upon the heaping plates of bacon and sausages. \"And you're only on the second course?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba leaned back, patting his stomach in satisfaction. \"Yep; believe it or not, this is only half the meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru stared at the plates. \"Wow...you musta been hungry, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed a bit sheepishly. \"Yeah, but I think I mighta misjudged on this one; I might have to bring some home.\" He fixed the two with a determined grin. \"Still, I'm gonna eat as much of it as I possibly can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he'd been speaking, Konohamaru had been staring at the plates, thinking hard. Suddenly, an idea came to him. Reaching up, he tugged Naruto's shirt. \"Oi, Boss, I think I've got an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Blinking, he looked down at the younger boy. \"What is it, Konohamaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Konohamaru gestured at Kiba's stomach, then at his and Naruto's. \"Easy; this guy says he won't be able to finish it all, and the Daimyo's Breakfast feast is supposed to be the biggest thing this place has, so how about we help him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened, while Kiba scowled. \"No way! You're not bumming a free meal off of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru growled. <i>Yeah, what do you take us for?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that things were about to get ugly, Konohamaru waved his arms. \"N-no, that's not what I meant.\" He gestured at himself and Naruto. \"The boss and I have some money to spare, so I figure we can split the bill three ways, and we all get a meal out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked between Konohamaru and Kiba, thinking. \"Huh...you know, that's actually not a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba considered this for a moment; when he'd been by himself, he'd been willing to pay for the fairly pricey meal alone, but if these two were splitting it with him...he smirked, reaching out and ruffling Konohamaru's hair. \"Huh, for someone who hangs around Naruto, you've got some pretty good ideas.\" Konohamaru beamed as the second half of the comment registered, while Naruto just spluttered angrily at the first part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a waiter came by, noticing the two boys standing by the booth. He coughed politely, getting their attention. \"Excuse me, sirs...would you like to sit at this booth as well?\" At their nods, the waiter gestured, and Naruto and Konohamaru slid into the opposite end of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Naruto exclaimed, getting comfortable. \"And don't bother taking our orders; we're sharing his!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit shocked at this, but nonetheless relieved Kiba wouldn't be tackling the monstrous Feast by himself, bustled off to the kitchen to retrieve the next dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the next course had arrived, and it was...</span></div></div>",

All we gotta do for this one is cut it into three; I can get the top part, and you guys can get the middle part and bottom part! That way, we all get to eat a lot, but we can still get through it all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two processed this for a moment. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an awesome idea, boss!\" Konohamaru exclaimed, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Kid's got a point; that was pretty good for you.\" Raising his fork and knife up, he began cutting it into sections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto beamed, puffing out his chest. \"Heh, thanks, I...hey!\" Grumbling, he began cutting out a section for himself and Konohamaru (since the kid would be at a height disadvantage.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, each boy had a generous helping of waffles and ice cream in front of them, each of which nearly came up to their heads. They spent a few seconds beaming at their helpings, licking their lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they dove into their plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto forked waffle and ice cream into his mouth, his face lit up. \"Mmm, this is good! The waffles are really crispy, but soft on the inside!\" He swallowed and began cutting himself another piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded, forking a hunk of ice cream into his mouth. \"Yeah, and the ice cream's really smooth, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru, preoccupied as he was with cutting off pieces of waffle and shoving them into his mouth, only nodded in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes ticked by, and the mounds of waffle and ice cream on their plates slowly shrank. As they shrank, the boys' stomachs began showing the effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's stomach expanded further, pushing out and inching closer to the table of the booth. He could feel his fly slowly being forced further open, and his net shirt, though it remained over his growing belly, strained harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's stomach took a little longer to grow, since he hadn't eaten anything previously, but soon enough, his stomach began to look distinctly round. As he powered on though the waffles, it began to push out, making a noticeable imprint on his shirt, pressing against the flame symbol on his front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru's belly started pressing against his yellow shirt, slightly pushing against the Konoha symbol on his front. Konohamaru giggled slightly, even as he stuffed himself. He could see why the Boss like to do it; it was fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the waffles had been completely depleted, and all three boys leaned back in their seats, rubbing their bellies and licking their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...that was good,\" Konohamaru mumbled, tongue sticking out the side of his mouth. His stomach had become round under his shirt, pushing it out more. What was more, the Konoha symbol he had on the front had begun pushing a bit further out as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it,\" Naruto added, burping. His own belly had grown noticeably, becoming quite round under his shirt. As a result, his flame symbol was now pushing outwards, though the tapered off-bit that reached to his chest was untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, it is pretty damn tasty, ain't it?\" Kiba grinned, licking his lips. Predictably, his own stomach had bulged even more. His fly was mostly forced open, with only a few teeth still holding together, and his hoodie still rode completely on top of his belly. His net shirt was still holding steadfastly, though he was beginning to feel a slight strain...still, it was nothing compared to other strained clothes he'd had to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys spent the next few minutes resting, rubbing their bellies and burping.

He wasn't thrilled with the idea of Kiba stuffing himself even more, but they smelled so good, and the way the juice dripped off and pooled around them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru hadn't even realized he'd been panting, but evidently, Kiba had. Looking over at his buddy, Kiba chuckled. \"Ya want some, boy? Why didn't ya say so?\" Akamaru yipped, tail wagging in glee. \"In fact...\" He leaned forward a bit; catching his drift, Akamaru leapt off his shoulder and onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, his mouth already full of bacon. \"Huh? What're ya doin', Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Lettin' Akamaru join in the fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said this, Akamaru reached his plate. Licking his chops, he opened his mouth wide and grabbed a sausage, demolishing it in a few quick bites. His tail began wagging even faster, the tender meat and savory juices of the sausage better than he'd thought they'd be. Without further ado, he lunged towards more of the sausage, gobbling them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning at Akamaru's delight, Kiba picked up a fork in one hand, looked at at...and shrugged, setting it back down. He drew his plate closer to him, diving in with his hands and shoveling sausage after sausage into it, chewing just enough to get it down. His face lit up. <i>Oh man, these are amazing!</i> Licking some sausage grease that had found it's way onto the corner of his mouth, he gulped his current mouthful down and resumed attacking the sausage with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Konohamaru were no less enthusiastic with their plates of bacon. Upon their first bites, they had discovered the bacon to be extremely juicy and flavorful, a perfect mix between crispy and soft. They had grinned widely at this, and had begun cramming the sizable strips into their both in their entirety, chewing it with little difficulty and immediately filling their mouths with more bacon once they'd swallowed. In fact, their method of eating the bacon was remarkably similar to Kiba's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with the waffles before them, the plates of meat slowly diminished, and as they did so, their stomachs changed to accommodate them. Kiba's stomach slowly bulged outwards even further, placing even more strain on his net shirt. Akamaru's furry tummy had already begun to round out, and as he guzzled more of his sausages, it began to grow, slowly but noticeably. Naruto's belly continued to push out, further stretching out his flame symbol. Likewise, Konohamaru's belly continued growing outwards, stretching out his Konoha symbol a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the end of the piles, their upper torso garments began to give up the ghost; Kiba could feel the area of his net shirt around his belly starting to fray, and Naruto and Konohamaru's shirts had slowly begun to rise up, and soon a bit of flesh would be exposed to the world. As they came within the last few pieces of meat on their plates...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They all looked at the pitcher of milk, then each other, and they were about to fight over the pitcher, but the waiter had already noticed this dilemma, so he brought two more pitchers of milk, and even a bowl for Akamaru just as they were about to jump at the milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys took their pitchers, put their mouths on the spouts, then guzzled down their milk as fast as they could. Akamaru licked the milk in his bowl ferociously, lapping up large gulps of milk. Either way, each boy's belly began to bulge outward noticeably to accommodate for the sudden influx of the dairy fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's shirt finally gave up, being forced upward by his belly, which slowly pushed outward with milk. When he was done, a sliver of his belly revealed itself to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru was the slowest of the four, but he was still able to finish his pitcher in time, his belly filling out much like Naruto's. Because he was the smallest, his shirt rose more than Naruto's, his belly filling in every inch of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's furry belly pushed out even farther, and by the time he was finished with the massive amount of milk, it almost touched the ground as it swayed slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was by far the fastest of the group, the size of his belly not fazing him one bit as he gulped the milk down vivaciously, his stomach bulging out quickly, straining each string of his net shirt immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this pressure, the first string, which crossed his belly button, snapped violently, starting a chain reaction of snapping sounds that didn't end until Kiba's entire belly was free, beginning to strain a ring of strings around the edge of his belly. After he finished first, he patted his overfilled belly proudly, causing it to wobble and making a cool plopping and sloshing sound. The patting also forced some trapped gas out, and Kiba belched loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boys began to play with their bellies, the waiter returned. \"Do you guys want anymore drinks, or are you ready for the next course?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba said, \"I'm ready for the next course already!\" and Konohamaru said, \"I could use a pitcher of oj!\" Akamaru didn't care either way, so everyone stared at Naruto, waiting for his answer. Kiba even said, \"I'm fine with either, but it's up to you.\" Naruto then exclaimed...</span></div></div>",

Naruto's had already begun to peek out, though it had a ways to go before his belly button was showing. Konohamaru, by contrast, had more of his bare tummy showing, and it was only by an inch or two that his navel was still concealed. Kiba, having ripped the area of his net shirt around his stomach, had a good portion of his bare tummy in addition to his navel showing for all to see. Akamaru simply laid on his side, licking his chops and occasionally burping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the waiter returned with three large pitchers of orange juice, with a bowl for Akamaru. The man walked away, and the three boys, unable to wait any longer, seized their pitchers and began guzzling away. Even Akamaru staggered to his feet, belly wobbling, and began lapping up the juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with the milk, all of their midsections swelled as the orange juice entered it. Naruto's belly continued to push up, and his shirt slowly continued to rise, exposing more of his stomach and slowly scrunching up the flame symbol on the front. His pants also began to feel a bit snug, but he shrugged it off. By the time he finished and slammed it down, a good portion of his bare tummy was showing, but it was still an inch away from exposing his navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru, though he was still the slowest, didn't let up. Shortly into his guzzling, his yellow shirt was exposing his navel, and it continued to rise as his belly bulged. His shorts began feeling tight as well, but like his idol, he pressed on. As he let out a wet belch and set his pitcher down, his belly sloshed, his shirt having ridden a few inches above his belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Akamaru lapped up his juice, his belly swelled even more, growing closer and closer to the table. By the time he'd lapped up the last of it, his white-furred belly was touching the table. Letting out a wet burp, he flopped onto his side, sluggishly wagging his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's belly grew closer to the table, the strings around the edge of his belly continuing to strain; as he was halfway through the pitcher, he felt the strings begin to fray, much to his satisfaction, and he continued on, his pants beginning to feel tight in spite of being unbuttoned and unzipped. Once he'd depleted his, a few of the strings had begun to snap, and his pants were now feeling quite tight. He winced, but laughed it off; it he kept eating, that wouldn't be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they waited for the waiter to return, they resumed playing with their bellies, finding, to their delight, their stomachs had grown sloshy and jiggly from all the liquid, and they spent a few minutes shaking and smacking their stomachs to watch as they rippled. Naruto and Konohamaru were giggling freely. Kiba was doing his best to keep from doing the same, though the occassional giggle still escaped his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir play was interrupted by the sudden arrival of the waiter, who had brought them...</span></div></div>",

Each piece of toast was itself as wide as a plate, and each piece was ridiculously thick, at least 3 or 4 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, the four were handed their plates, and they each got pitchers of milk to drink as they please, as drinks were free for this meal. Kiba and Naruto ate with as much gusto as ever, but it was quite obvious that Konohamaru and Akamaru were starting to slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba still managed to eat the fastest, though not by much, and the growth of his belly reflected it, as another string on his net shirt broke, sending another chain reaction that tore the entire front of his net shirt open, his belly flopping out slightly, taking advantage of the new-found room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's belly had lifted his shirt up past his bellybutton already, and he proudly gave the growing mass a pat as he continued to binge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru's belly had lifted his shirt up all the way, and now the only thing slowing it down was the button of his shorts, which was getting closer and closer to the breaking point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Akamaru's belly was already touching the table, and because of this, it slowly began to spread his hind legs apart. He even had to adjust his front paws to make sure that he didn't fall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this happened before the four had made it to their second pieces.</span></div></div>",

Predictably, as they ate, all four of their bellies grew to accommodate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's midsection continue to grow, growing closer and closer to the table, moving quicker now that the whole front of his net shirt (the part not covered by his ridden-up hoodie, obviously) had been busted open. His pants, in spite of being unbuttoned and fully zipped, once again began to feel snug, but he paid it little mind; he wasn't going to lose the lead he had now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto followed close behind him, his stomach bulging with every bite of french toast that entered his gut. His shirt was pushed further and further above his navel, the flame symbol on his chest continuing to crinkle up. His trousers began to feel rather tight, but he pressed on, not wanting to lose his lead, especially not when he was so close behind Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru, though he had slowed down, was still trucking on, forking bite after bite into his mouth even as he blushed at the realization that his bare stomach and belly button was showing for the whole world to see. Still, if it didn't bother the boss, it shouldn't bother him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFueled by this thought, he put on a burst of speed, gulping down pieces of French toast even as his stomach continued to bulge out, putting more and more pressure on his pants button. Soon, the cloth around it became strained, and after that, it began to quiver, which only intensified as he began alternate bites of French toast with swigs of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Akamaru trucked away at his french toast, he had to continue to adjust his front paws as his furry tummy grew, forcing his back legs further and further apart. He winced at it, but he pressed on; after all, the French toast tasted great, and it would be a shame to let it go to waste...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes ticked by, more of the second pieces vanishing as they stomachs they went into grew. Eventually, they had it down to less than a quarter. Gulping, Konohamaru picked up his fork, swallowed one of the last pieces...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and yelped as his tortured shorts button finally up, shooting off and striking Kiba's belly. The dog-nin in question had been taking a gulp of milk at the time, and had nearly sprayed it all over the table; luckily, he thought to bring his arm up to his face and block the majority of it from spraying anywhere else but on his sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the commotion, Naruto and Akamaru paused, looking over at Konohamaru, who was blushing as he looked down at his engorged stomach and tentatively felt around the area of his shorts where his button had been. He blushed even harder as his fingers slipped through the few teeth of his fly that had been opened, feeling the cloth of the briefs he was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stayed in this position for a few long seconds, the blush remaining steady on his face. Then, looking up to see the others, he closed his eyes, took a deep breath...</span></div></div>",

All the while, they were drinking their respective drinks, albeit at a more normal pace this time, waiting for the next course to come out. With this, the four had enough time to allow their stomachs to settle, and all four felt as if they could still continue for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon afterwards, the waiter brought the last course, which was eggs with toast, spreading out the portions evenly between the four.</span></div></div>",

Kiba, in particular, couldn't help but grin as he swallowed mouthful after mouthful. The eggs were light and fluffy, salted just right with the right amount of cheese... <i>Oh man, these are probably the best eggs I've ever had!</i> He continued shoveling in his mouth, his belly continuing to swell, now only about an inch or two from touching the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's belly had grown to the point where his belly was all but lifting him off the table, and he had to almost lay down on it to continue eating his eggs, a task that slowly grew more difficult as more of the eggs entered his furry gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Konohamaru were diving into their eggs with equal amounts of gusto. With every bite that Konohamaru took, his belly bulged out further and a bit quicker, now that his button was gone. In addition, his fly was slowly forced down, a few teeth at a time. Naruto's shirt continued to rise and the flame symbol continued to crinkle; before long, it was resting squarely on top of his belly. In addition, his pants began to feel very tight, but he didn't want to lose his groove by unbuttoning them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened. <i>That's it!</i> Grabbing a pitcher of milk that had thoughtfully been provided by the waiter, he tilted his head backwards and lifted the pitcher along with it. Opening wide, he guzzled the milk, ignoring the streams that ran down either side of his face; besides, his shirt was mostly white, so it wasn't like it would show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach grew steadily as the milk entered it, pushing further out and straining his pants...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...until finally his button gave way. Luckily, due to the position in which he was sitting, it merely bounced off the underside of the table and came to settle on the floor. Licking his lips, Naruto dove back into his eggs, shoveling them into his mouth and interspersing them with bites of toast. All the while, his fly unzipped every time his stomach bulged, granting him more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a matter of minutes, their utensils clattered to the table, the eggs and toast completely depleted. Sighing deeply, all three boys leaned back in their seats rubbing their bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-man,\" Konohamaru managed, massaging his belly a bit. \"I-I don't think I could eat another bite; I'm stuffed...\" His belly now stuck out a good few inches in front of him, his yellow shirt still riding completely above his belly. Thanks to the angle at which he was leaning, his white briefs were showing through his fully unzipped shorts, but he was too stuffed to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too...but it was so good...\" Naruto burped, licking some crumbs off his cheeks. His stomach was sticking out even further than Konohamaru's, and it was beginning to touch the table. His shirt rode completely above it, and his fly was open, exposing his frog-patterned undies to the whole world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba belched, massaging his bare belly with both hands before replying. \"Yeah...I'm definitely coming here again....\" He gave the other two boys (and Akamaru) a friendly smirk. \"Thanks for the help, guys; not sure if I coulda downed this all on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto opened an eye and winked at him, while Konohamaru merely raised an arm and gave him a thumbs-up. Akamaru, lying on his back, his belly (roughly the size of a medium-sized bowling ball now) sticking up into the air and forcing his back legs apart, merely whined and wagged his tail in acknowledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba beamed at the dog before examining his own belly; whereas Naruto's was simply touching the table, his midsection was pushing against it, all but wedging him in. It was rather tight, but he just took that as a sign that he'd done good. In addition, he had felt the inseams of his pants rip a bit, but he shoved that aside for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes, all four relaxed, recuperating from their massive meal and tenderly massaging/patting/smacking their bellies.

Soon, his expression was mirroring Kiba's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a similar sense of dread, Konohamaru tapped Naruto on the shoulder. \"Hey, Boss, can I see that?\" Wordlessly, Naruto handed Konohamaru the check.

Don't ask why!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled warmly. \"No need to worry; I have no intention of retracting my statement.\" He craned his head a bit, looking at the three boys' bloated midsections. \"You ordered the Daimyo's Breakfast Feast, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba couldn't help but smirk at this, patting his gut. Even Naruto and Konohamaru grinned and rubbed their stomachs, nodding eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed. \"That's what I thought.\" He nodded. \"And it was just you three who ate it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba burped, looking over at Akamaru, dozing and lying on his back; his stuffed belly, sticking up into the air, almost resembled a white, furry basketball. \"Well, Akamaru helped too, but yeah, we all did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smirked good-naturedly. \"Is that right?\" They all nodded. \"Did you know that the last time this meal was completed, it took twelve people to finish it?\" He chuckled again as Naruto, Kiba, and Konohamaru's eyes widened and their mouths fell open. \"Yes, the fact that the four of you managed to complete the whole thing is nothing short of amazing.\" He reached towards the table and plucked the check out of Konohamaru's hands. \"That's why...\" He held it up in full view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...this one's on the house.\" He tore the check in half, discarding it on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto found his voice. \"Are...are you serious?\" He rubbed his belly absentmindedly. \"Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" The man replied cheerily. \"I am the manager, after all.\" He strode forward and placed something on the booth table. \"A little something to reward you all.\" Giving them one final nod, he turned and walked into the back of the diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExchanging an odd look, all three boys looked at the three slips upon the table.

Seeing as how Akamaru would have difficulty resting on his head, he'd tucked Akamaru within his hoodie. His white belly caused the hoodie to hang off to the side, but at least he was fairly secure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping and grinning, Kiba made his way to his room, his eyes lighting up at the sight of his bed. Staggering towards it, he turned around once he reached the foot of the bed and collapsed onto it. The bed creaked and sagged under the weight of his midsection, but Kiba didn't mind; right now, all he wanted to do was sleep off that huge breakfast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his side, Akamaru stirred. Whining, he yawned, looking up at Kiba. Noticing, Kiba's eyes moved downwards. \"Heh, sorry, Akamaru; didn't mean to wake ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked. <i>It's no problem.</i> He winced at the sight of his own midsection, then looked at Kiba's; at this point, the elastic band of his net shirt had snapped, the halves sticking out to either side. His hoodie was still situated at the top of his gut, but he didn't seem to have any intentions of taking it off anytime soon, if his own yawn was any indication. <i>Man, we really did a number on that breakfast...</i> He burped, then continued on as if nothing had happened. <i>So, was it expensive?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Yeah, but the manager was so impressed, he gave us the whole thing on the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's eyes widened at this. <i>Seriously?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded eagerly. \"Yep, and that ain't even the best part.\" He fished around in his pocket and pulled out his voucher and held it up for Akamaru to see. \"He gave all of us these vouchers for a full month of free meals at that place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's eyes bugged out, but he couldn't help but wag his tail; the food <i>had</i> been awful tasty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned cockily. \"And I know exactly what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna train 'till I can tackle the Daimyo's Breakfast Feast on my own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru yelped and started to say something...only for a belch to escape. Whimpering, he settled back down. <i>You know what? I'm so stuffed right now, all I wanna do is go back to sleep.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba ruffled Akamaru's head. \"Sounds like a plan, buddy.\" Settling on his back and spreading his arms out to the sides and yawned widely. He dully noted he was still clad in his clothes, but decided he could change out of them after his nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning one more time, he closed his eyes, and in short order had fallen sleep, gut rising and falling, Akamaru's doing the same as he slept beside him (near his head, of course, so he wouldn't get an unpleasant wakeup call.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kiba's waffles were just as big as the ones they'd all eaten the previous day, and there had to be at least half a dozen scoops of ice cream between them. Naruto had opted for a stack of five pancakes, each as big as the ones they had enjoyed during their first time eating there. Akamaru's plate of bacon was set in front of him, and it was all he could do to keep from drooling at the meat piled higher than two times his height. Lastly, Konohamaru had gotten a massive plate of scrambled eggs, with a side of a small pile of bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll their arguments were forgotten as they stared at their plates, glee in their eyes. Picking up their utensils, they proceeded to attack them with fierce abandon. Akamaru, of course, simply lunged at his dish, gobbling down as many pieces of bacon as he could.</span></div></div>",

The waiters, knowing where this was going, had already prepared another waffle dish for Kiba and brought it before him, much to his delight. As soon as it was set down, he started attacking it once again, only occasionally stopping to take a drink of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the three Narutos were still working on their own pancakes, though they were already a good way through.

His eyes went to the side and lit up as he saw the waiters preemptively bring another plate of waffles and ice cream to the table, but never let up.

Almost immediately, the taste of bacon flooded his mouth, and his stomach swelled and pushed out, pushing his shirt up.

A nearby waiter heard their conversation, and quickly tended to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, he was in the kitchen informing the chef to make french toast for Konohamaru, sausages for Kiba and Akamaru, and eggs and toast for Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust an hour before, the three were stuffing their faces greedily, Naruto and Konohamaru using the shadow clone trick while Kiba just ate the old fashioned way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Naruto again had a dozen pancakes at the ready, and he created two shadow clones to help him tuck it all in. At this point, he noticed that his shadow clones were missing the rapidly growing midsection that he sported, which surprised him, but he didn't care either way as the three Naruto's relentlessly dug in to their pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru made a shadow clone of his own at that point, and the two Konohamaru's eagerly dug into their bacon and eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was without clones, but that did not discourage him one bit. If anything, he sped up to make sure that he wouldn't fall behind. He vivaciously shoved pieces of waffle and ice cream into his mouth, ensuring that there wasn't even a split second where his maw was left un-crammed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this, Kiba's belly was expanding outwards much faster than either Naruto or Konohamaru without their clones. In ten minutes, his belly now stuck out quite a bit, pushing against his net shirt considerably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt around twenty minutes, the strain was too much, and a string over the front of his belly broke, causing a few around it to break as well. At this point, he already went through another serving of waffles, and was delighted to see that more was waiting for him. He dug into that one just as fast, and the results showed. At thirty minutes, another ring of net shirt was demolished. By forty minutes, all of the net shirt around his belly had broken, leaving the mass of food-filled flesh completely open to the world. In addition, his pants button was crying for dear life as it was about to be popped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba then started on another serving, as his current one was depleted. He made sure to unbutton his pants before he broke them, as they were his favorite, and after doing so, his belly pushed out even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and his two clones dug into their pancakes just like last time. They were still quick in their eating, but not nearly as fast as Kiba. Either way, they greedily stuffed the hotcakes into their maws, and their bellies pushed out even farther as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actual Naruto's belly proceeded to work farther down the zipper, making room for itself as it did so. After twenty minutes, it was at the bottom of the zipper, and was filling in any and all spaces it could. The Naruto clones had significantly smaller bellies, having only eaten from this most recent stack, and their bellies were pushing against their shirts as much as possible without starting to lift them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, all three Naruto's finished, with the original rubbing his belly contentedly as it strained against his inseam. The other two had bellies that lifted their respective shirts just enough to reveal a strip of flesh. At this point, they had finished their first stack, but Naruto decided to keep his two clones in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty more minutes later, each clone had stomachs that lifted their shirts enough to reveal their navels, and the actual Naruto had ripped his inseam, his belly making room and straining the bottom of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Konohamaru's worked almost as fast as Naruto did, and they trudged through their eggs and bacon, switching about every twenty minutes too keep things interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the hour, Konohamaru's belly had lifted up the entirety of his shirt, and it was threatening to pop the button off of his shorts. His clone wasn't that far behind, his belly lifting up his shirt considerably. The pair finished their current dish, and were ready for another<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards the end, the two Konohamaru's had finally stopped for a breather, his own stomach having filled in the area above his inseam, and his clone's having lifted his shirt up just past his navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was the first to disperse, and as he did so, he felt the taste of all of the pancakes at once as his belly stretched out quickly to accommodate. The bottom of his  shirt ripped, and he had half a mind to take it off. His pants also ripped further to make room, and if it wasn't for his belly, Naruto would be revealing his underwear quite clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru had dispersed soon afterwards, and his belly also expanded outwards, stretching then ripping his inseam slightly before his shirt began to strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause the two had eaten so much, for the last ten minutes, Naruto and Konohamaru took a breather as Kiba caught up surprisingly quickly. Kiba crammed waffle into his mouth viciously, and his belly began to stretch the bottom of his net shirt. His inseam was also straining considerably, and, to preserve his pants, Kiba made sure to slide them downwards, revealing the back of his green boxers. He didn't care, though, as those pants were his favorite, and his mom would kill him if she had to buy another pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brings us up to the present moment, with Naruto having the largest belly, and Kiba lagging behind just a bit. Konohamaru was in last as far as size went, but he was determined to keep going. At this point, Akamaru, who had been working on his bacon at a steady pace, had finished his plate, and was himself finished, as he couldn't touch his paws to the ground, even if he tried. He merely chose to watch the other three with intrigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three tenderly rubbed their bellies, and their bellies had put a considerable strain on the table, so they each scooted back for comfort. Either way, their next courses finally arrived. They more or less ate the same, except for Naruto, who had a clever idea to create another shadow clone, and have that shadow clone feed him so he didn't have to reach around his massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three continued eating until each had their fill, and it was clear that...</span></div></div>",

Naruto, looking down, noticed this and grinned. <i>Heh...my gut's startin' to look a little bigger, too!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was nothing new, of course: sometimes, when he'd eat at Ichiraku's, he'd completely eat his fill, leaving his tummy somewhat swollen under his jacket. He'd always been somewhat fascinated by this, but it had always vanished after an hour or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand ceased its ministration of his belly, and wandered to his pocket, where his overfilled wallet was being kept. His eyes gleamed as an idea occurred to him. He had off for a few days, and he really had nothing else planned...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis in mind, Naruto spun around in his seat, grinning at Teuchi. The man blinked, somewhat confused. \"So, uh, Naruto...you done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done?\" Naruto repeated, patting his stomach. \"I've just gotten started! Get me the biggest bowl of miso ramen ya got; ya know, the one usually meant for a buncha people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyame's eyes widened. \"A-are you sure? I mean, that might be a lot, even for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned, squeezing his eyes shut. \"Eh, so what if it is? I'm not doing anything for a few days, and besides, I love a challenge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking their heads and smiling at the antics of their number one customer, Teuchi and Ayame went about preparing Naruto's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short order, a truly massive bowl of miso ramen was set before. It took up a great deal of the length of the counter, and stood about three feet tall. It was filled to the brim with broth, noodles, and a few other toppings Naruto liked. Eyes gleaming, he licked his lips, grabbed his chopsticks, and dug in.</span></div></div>",

After the third bowl, Naruto's stomach had become large enough to create quite the impression in his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another two bowls, Naruto's shirt began to rise slowly with every bowl. He continued to eat with gusto, ignoring everything around as he was focused on the ramen and eating as much of it as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, another three bowls had gone down his ravenous maw, and his stomach was showing obvious signs of it. It now protruded out considerable, lifting up his shirt to reveal a large strip of flesh under his navel.

As the noodles and broth poured down his throat, his stomach slowly grew, and his black shirt rose up a little further, exposing the bottom half of his navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the noodles were gone, Naruto picked up the bowl and downed what broth was left. Sighing, he looked up, and was delighted to see Teuchi had already prepared his next two bowls in anticipation. Grinning, he drew his twelfth bowl towards himself and started going to town on it. Again, as the ramen and broth went down his gullet, his stomach swelled a bit more, bringing his shirt up higher; about three-quarters of his navel was exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto downed the broth, he noticed his pants were starting to feel a little tighter. He frowned, and almost reached down to undo them, but decided against it; he was in the zone, and he didn't want to lose his focus. With that, he seized his thirteenth bowl and began devouring it. Again, his stomach bulged, and again, his shirt rose up, up, up... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Naruto downed the broth of his thirteenth bowl and gave a satisfied burp, his shirt had ridden completely above his navel, showing it in its entirety. His pants now felt even more snug, but Naruto only grinned; just went to show how good he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing happily, he turned around in his seat and leaned against the counter on one arm, happily patting his engorged belly with the other one. \"Phew, I'm really eating a lot today...\" He burped again, and giggled a bit. \"'Course, I'm gonna eat even more once I rest up a little bit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Teuchi and Ayame shared a resigned glance. Naruto, it seemed, was far from finished, but that was nothing new...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to help himself, Naruto dipped a finger into his exposed navel, giggling at the ticklish sensations produced as he wriggled it.

One extra-large stick of dango, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, the store owner coughed. \"Al-alright...\" He bustled about, getting the treat ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Naruto called out again, his hand resting on his stomach. \"Also, after ya get that one done, keep 'em comin', and don't stop till I can't eat anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis back turned to Naruto, the store owner's shoulder's hitched, then slumped. \"Very well, sir...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the first stick was ready, and the store owner handed it to Naruto, his features resigned even as he turned back around and began preparing more. Naruto, on the other hand, grinned and licked his lips: just like he'd asked, the dumplings were really big, so much so they had to be practically clumped together on the stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting any more time, Naruto brought the stick to his mouth, grabbing hold of a dumpling and pulling it off with his teeth. Chewing, he grinned at the sweet flavor that exploded in his mouth. <i>Ah yeah, that hits the spot...</i> Swallowing, he quickly attacked the other two dumplings, and soon, they were going down his gullet as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips, Naruto dropped the empty stick on the counter. <i>Wow, that was pretty good; I gotta come here more often!</i> Even as he was finishing this thought, the store owner walked over to him and handed him two more of the extra-large dango sticks. Eyes lighting up, Naruto took them both, opening his mouth extra wide. Then, putting the sticks close to his mouth, he chomped off two dumplings each from one, chewing happily and swallowing before downing the remaining dumplings. Dropping the sticks next to the first one, he grabbed the next two sticks as they were being offered to him and repeated the process. Two more sticks dropped...then two more...then another two...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dumplings went down his throat, his stomach slowly bulged, forcing his shirt a little higher above his navel with every couple sticks. In addition, with each stick eaten, his pants began feeling a little tighter. Noticing this, but determined not to lose his groove, Naruto continued downing dango sticks like there was no tomorrow. As before, with every couple dango sticks eaten, his stomach got a little bigger, his shirt rode up a little higher, and the waistline of his pants began feeling tighter. Meanwhile, the few sticks he had started off with had begun growing into a small but nonetheless sizable pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He sought to remedy the problem, doing so by sucking in his gut as much as he could, then struggling to undo the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did so, the store owner returned with more dango for him. The store owner just stared at Naruto awkwardly for a moment, as Naruto was currently crouching over, struggling with his pants button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was finally able to free his belly, and it nearly flopped out onto the counter, forcing Naruto's fly halfway down and his shirt up as it did so. His stomach finally came to rest just below the counter. Luckily, there was quite a bit of overhang on the counter, so Naruto's belly had plenty of room down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, now that his pain was relieved, Naruto sat back, patting his belly, ignoring the weird stare from the store owner. His eyes then lit up at the sight in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store owner, sick of having to give so many sticks to Naruto, piled a dozen sticks onto a plate so that he would just have to give the plate to Naruto. Either way, Naruto cheerily grinned at the store owner to show that he appreciated the gesture, then he went back to stuffing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw how the dango was stacked into rows of three, then got an idea. Using both hands, he managed to pick up a row of three dango sticks, then he lined them up in his mouth, and took three at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was somewhat of a struggle, however, as the dumplings were so big. Naruto managed it, however, and the dumplings completely filled his cheeks, and there was so much food in Naruto's mouth that he could barely close his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, he had made it through those three, and repeated the process, getting the hang of it and gaining momentum. Soon enough, he was finished with the first stack and he discarded the sticks in the pile, swiftly moving onto the next set of three, his stomach lifting his shirt slightly higher after each set of three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, his plate was emptied and the pile of sticks was considerably larger. To his delight, there was another plate right next to it, waiting for him, and he dug in without hesitation.</span></div></div>",

Because of this, he was slurping down the noodles just as quickly as Naruto was, consistently staying twelve bowls behind the blonde that he looked up to so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did so, his small stomach began pushing on the fabric of his t-shirt. After two bowls, the shirt had given up, rising about halfway to his navel. Naruto's stomach, on the other hand, was able to push his shirt above his navel at this point, revealing it to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother two bowls had brought Konohamaru's shirt to his bellybutton, showing how much smaller he was than Naruto, who was currently working on his pants button, trying to free the monstrous globe behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Naruto's belly surged out with a wobble, and he sighed contentedly before continuing to dig in with renewed fervor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing this, Konohamaru thought,\"That must feel really good\" before taking the cue to undo his own pants button, a much easier task as his stomach wasn't nearly as large. Due to this, Konohamaru's bloated belly only pushed out a little bit, though now there was much more room for Konohamaru's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each passing bowl, the stomachs of the two swelled out even more, lifting their respective shirts up. Four bowls later, Naruto's shirt had reached the top of his stomach, framing the bulbous symbol of gluttonous glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another two bowls, Konohamaru's stomach had done the same.

Teuchi merely smiled warmly, with memories of Naruto's ramen eating antics popping into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto stuffed his face, Konohamaru was amazed, exclaiming, \"Wow, boss! You're the best! I wanna eat that much ramen someday!\" He continued to stare at Naruto in excitement and anticipation of the next bite. Naruto couldn't help but chuckle as Konohamaru nearly lost his balance with his belly flopping around when he turned his stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto went back to his ramen afterwards, regaining momentum in his goal to eat as much as he possibly could.</span></div></div>",

Tsunade told her that she needed Naruto, so she made a beeline for Ichiraku's, as that was Naruto's favorite place to eat at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Naruto stuffing himself with ramen, so focused on his binge that he didn't notice Sakura come in. Sakura tried to get his attention, only to be ignored. Soon enough, she conked Naruto on the head, leaving a red bump on the head of Naruto, who was rolling on the ground, holding his newly acquired bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Sakura was yelling at Naruto, \"Lady Tsunade needs you! You should pay more attention instead of stuffing your face so much!\" This went on as Naruto and Sakura walked over to the Hokage's office, with Naruto being a bit bummed about his interrupted ramen binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were in the Hokage's office, and Tsunade was sitting at her desk reading paperwork, with Shizune holding Tonton at her side. \"Good, you're here.\" Tsunade said before going over the reason why Naruto was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Recently, we've received a strange mission request. It's only a D-rank...\" and at that, she was interrupted by Naruto's complaining, and Sakura conked Naruto on the head again. Now that she was free to speak again, Tsunade continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is only a D-rank, but you're perfectly suited for this mission. Anyone in the leaf village that knows you knows that you have an obsession with ramen. You eat practically every meal at Ichiraku's, and it's a wonder that you stay as slim as you are with how much you eat there sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what's your point, granny Tsunade?\" Naruto demanded, getting impatient, receiving an annoyed response from Tsunade, \"My point is that this mission involves eating a lot of ramen. You see, there is a village in the Land of Fire that is famous for its agriculture, particularly rice, and the astounding amount of food that they can produce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then Why didn't you sent Choji?\" Naruto interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't send Choji\", Tsunade said through clenched teeth, losing her patience, \"Because he is busy with other missions, and he doesn't like ramen nearly as much as you do. Anyway, the village exports a lot of food, but they still have quite a bit of excess, so they have a ramen eating competition every month or so to get rid of the excess. Unfortunately, their usual participants will not be nearly enough, so they requested that we send one of our best eaters to help them. That's where you come in. Go to the village and make sure that they have no more excess. They're paying Konoha in quite a bit of food, and we need more food here. There's also money in it for you, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura, essentially forgetting her annoyance, expressed her concerns, saying, \"But Naruto can't go alone! What if the Akatsuki finds him.\" Tsunade was prepared for that, responding with, \"I know that you want to go with him, but medical ninjas are always in short supply, so we're saving you for more dangerous missions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then continued...</span></div></div>",

The room itself was surprisingly nicely-furnished; there was a bureau for clothes, a nice-look closet, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked down at the surface he was resting on. He'd been right; he was lying on a bed, though he was still fully-clothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scowled. \"What the hell's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, you're awake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's head snapped towards the direction of the voice...and his jaw promptly dropped open when he saw the speaker, entering through the room's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards him was a wolf, but not like any wolf he'd ever seen. He stood upright, knees bent  and the back of his feet-paws-lifted up into the air like a regular dog or wolves' hind legs. His fur was a dark brown, a crop of lighter-brown fur that resembled hair resting on his head; a pair of triangular ears, near-identical to a regular wolf's, stuck up out of it Further adding to the strangeness, he wore a black, short-sleeved T-shirt and khaki shorts, though no footwear of any kind. Completing the ensemble was a pair of glasses resting on the bridge of his muzzle, amplifying the sight of his hazel-brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing Naruto's flabbergasted expression, the wolf laughed nervously, scratching the back of his head. \"Uh...how's that bump on your head feeling.\" He soon had his reply, by way of a kunai embedded in the wall a few scant inches from where his head was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelping, he jumped to the side. \"H-hey, watch it! You coulda killed me!\" All he received in response was an angry glare. \"Right, that was probably the idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and that's what's gonna happen if you don't tell me what the hell's going on!\" Naruto retorted, springing out of the bed and angrily facing the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf groaned, massaging his temples. \"Alright, alright; I was gonna come clean with you anyways, but better just to get it out of the way now...\" He looked to the side and mumbled to himself, \"If only to avoid more thrown weaponry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to Naruto, the wolf took a deep breath. \"Ok, first off, the name's Hunter. I already know who you are, Naruto, so no need to introduce yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Naruto exclaimed, glaring at Hunter with a mix of anger and confusion. \"How...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my sources,\" Hunter replied evasively. Before Naruto could inquire further, he continued speaking. \"Second, you're probably wondering where you are...\" He scratched the back of his head again. \"It's an inn not too far from Konoha; it doesn't look like much, but it's actually quite nice. As to how you're here...\" Hunter trailed off, gulping and pulling at the neck of his T-shirt. \"I, uh...kinda-sorta kidnapped you.\" As soon as the words left his muzzle, several shuriken embedded themselves into the wall opposite where the kunai had landed. \"Geez, watch it! Just lemme explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain?!\" Naruto practically screamed, getting in close to Hunter. \"You hit me in the head, knocked me out, and dragged me out here to do whatever to me! How does that need explaining!\" Momentarily out of breath, Naruto took a step back, panting furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep, shaky breath to steady himself, Hunter continued. \"I didn't hit you on the back of the head; I had an acquaintance shoot a tranq dart into your neck.\" He laughed, this time a bit more earnestly. \"I woulda done it myself, but I'm sorta  lousy shot.\" He winced as Naruto's hand went to his neck; indeed, there was a tiny puncture wound there. \"The, uh, reason your head's hurting is because you somehow ended up falling backwards when you fell unconscious.\" He smiled. \"Good thing you have such a hard head, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling, Naruto felt the back of his still-tender head. \"I guess...but that still doesn't answer my big question: WHY the hell have you brought me out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? That's a very good question,\" Hunter muttered, looking slightly nervous. \"Look, Naruto, the truth is, I kinda brought you out here so I could, um...help you stuff yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Naruto's angry look faded, replaced by one of utter confusion. \"Wh...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded. \"Uh, yeah.\" He took a deep breath, choosing his next words carefully. \"This inn's in a small town that's got some good restaurant's for a cheap price, and I'd be more than willing to treat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, the anger returned to Naruto's face. \"Why, so you can eat me once I'm ready to bust?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's eyes widened, and he waved his hands/paws in front of him frantically. \"Wh-what?! No, no, nothing like that. I just, uh, wanna see you stuffing yourself up close and personal.\" He fixed Naruto with a nervous smile. \"So, you game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glared at Hunter for a few seconds, only to be interrupted by the growling of his stomach. Placing a hand over it, he scowled at Hunter. \"Grrr...fine. Just don't try any funny business, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned a wolfish grin. \"Wolf's honor.\" Walking to the inn room's door, he opened the door and gestured for Naruto to walk through. \"So, I've seen a lot of restaurants around town, but I found two that might be good to start with; a ramen place and an ice cream shop. Which one you wanna tackle first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took Naruto a moment to think before he replied... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, I was on my way to Ichiraku's before you decided to 'invite' me to this little food run of yours...\" grumbled Naruto in annoyance, causing Hunter to chuckle sheepishly as he brushed the back of his head, then said, \"Eheheh, yeah, again, sorry about that...but if you want ramen, there's a great ramen joint not to far from here that I'm sure'll do the job just fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rolled his eyes at the notion of anything comparing to Ichiraku's, but as he did, his stomach once again rumbled hungrily, and so with a shrug, he said, \"Hey, ramen's ramen, I guess...why not.\"  With that, Hunter almost eagerly led Naruto to a little ramen shack nearby the inn.  Hunter sat himself atop one of the stools as he called for the cook.  Naruto; in a less than enthusiastic manner, simply plopped himself a seat away from Hunter and waited.  \"Excuse me, sir,\" Hunter started as the cook arrived, \"but my new friend here would like to try a few bowls of your steamiest ramen, if you'd be so kind.\"  The cook nodded then headed back to resume stirring his pot.  A moment of uncomfortable silence passed before Naruto sighed then turned to Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo exactly WHY do you want to watch me stuff myself?\" asked a legitimately curious Naruto.  Hunter fumbled nervously for a moment then turned to the blond, \"Well...my sources say you're one of the biggest eaters in all of Konoha.  I've always been rather fascinated in seeing how far one's appetite allows them to devour, and as a wolf...\" Naruto's look grew sterner as Hunter trailed off, but he followed up with, \"...I've always wanted to see if humans could truly consume more than us.  If their appetites didn't exceed their stomachs capacity.  From what I've heard, that's not a problem for you, Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an odd notion to say the least, but Naruto accepted it at face value.  \"Still doesn't explain why you had to KNOCK ME OUT first!\" blurted out Naruto in annoyance.  <br>\r\n\"Well, you might've said no.\"<br>\r\n\"I also might've killed you.\"<br>\r\n\"....Yeah, I...suppose you might've...b-but you didn't!  So that's a start, right?\" chuckled Hunter in an effort to loosen up his 'dining guest' a tad.  It wasn't really working.  But then the ramen arrived.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grabbed a bowl and took a whiff.  The aroma was surprisingly pleasant to say the least, but still nowhere near as mouth watering as the broth's scent from Ichiraku's.  But as his mind continued to compare the two, his stomach once again rumbled indiscriminately, and so, he began to slurp down the noodles.  The warm flavorful broth rushed down his throat and warmed his belly soothingly, causing Naruto to ease up a bit as he began to slurp down his bowl at a faster rate, until it was completely drained clean.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmacking his lips, Naruto raised an eyebrow.  \"Huh.  Not half bad...\" he said to no one in particular as he began to get to work on the second bowl.  Then the next bowl.  Then the next.  As the noodles and broth continued to travel down his throat and into Naruto's eager stomach, he cared less and less about comparing what was better, and even less about why this Hunter character had 'invited' him out.  If it meant free food that was at least half-way decent, why complain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter meanwhile, observed and watched Naruto as he almost mechanically slurped down one bowl after another.  He was unlike any human he'd ever seen; like a ramen eating machine with no stop sign anywhere to be found.  As the bowls began to stack up, Hunter knew this was going to be an interesting experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed until finally, a respectable stack of ramen bowls piled up behind Naruto as he leaned back and sighed with satisfaction, giving his satisfied belly a good few happy pats.  Hunter glanced down to see Naruto's concave stomach had the slightest of outward curves to it now from ingesting all that ramen at once.  \"S-so, did'ja like your meal?\" asked Hunter nervously.<br>\r\n\"Hey, it actually wasn't half bad,\" responded a semi-impressed Naruto, which was good enough for Hunter, knowing he wasn't planning on calling it quits anytime soon.  \"Great!  Where to now?\" asked Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought for a moment...</span></div></div>",

That is a pretty weird question...\" Thinking for a moment, he unzipped the top few teeth of his jacket zipper and peered inside. \"Looks like a black t-shirt with Konoha's symbol on it...why?\" He zipped his jacket back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthropomorphic wolf laughed a bit sheepishly. \"Eh, I just prefer it when guys like you are wearing regular shirts instead of net shirts when they're stuffing themselves.\" He laughed heartily at Naruto's flabbergasted expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill chuckling, he led Naruto inside the restaurant, where he quickly got the two of them seats, where they were soon looking through their menus. Seeing a waiter come by, Hunter waved him over. \"Hi!\" Hunter chirped up, ignoring the man's confusion at his appearance. \"Can I get the jumbo steak/rib combo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure,\" the man replied, scribbling it down on his notepad. He looked towards Naruto. \"And for you, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto spent a few more moments looking through the menu before he replied...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Naruto grinned, then nodded with certainty and said, \"Then I'll have one of those!\" as both he and Hunter handed the waiter back the menus.  \"And to drink?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, just some orange juice would be nice,\" said Hunter.<br>\r\n\"Cola if you've got it,\" responded Naruto.  The waiter once again scribbled on his notepad and carried on.  <br>\r\n\"Jumbo deluxe combo, eh?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, wolf or not, I'll be damned if I'm gonna let someone who isn't even going to stuff himself show me up on a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked happily.  Seemed Naruto was starting to come around to this little venture, and perhaps a little competitive edge was just what he needed to get Naruto completely on board and stuffing himself to his absolute max.  So, after a moment, Hunter said, \"I dunno, the jumbo combo's pretty big as is.  You sure you can stomach it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer his question, Naruto's stomach let out a hungry growl which almost sounded as angry as Naruto would have sounded answering himself.  Smirking, Naruto turned to Hunter and said, \"Oh don't you worry about me, slim.  Before you know it, you're gonna learn a thing or two about how a real warrior eats.\"  Hunter was indeed hoping that would be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the food was ready.  The waiter brought both their drinks, then the main courses.  For Hunter; a large platter of sirloin steak and BBQ ribs, and to Naruto; a much larger platter with much larger servings.  Naruto's eyes widened with shock at the sheer size of his meal-to-be, but the wonderfully rich smell of smoked beef and BBQ sauce was enough to make both their mouths water with anticipation.  Wasting absolutely no time, both dug right into their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in unison, both Hunter and Naruto grabbed the ribs stack with their hands and sunk their faces into the juicy, sauce laden pork.  Hunter occasionally glanced back at Naruto with amazement to see the boy 'wolfing' down his larger stack at a considerably faster rate than he was currently eating.  Internally cheering, he knew his plan to get Naruto going was working like a charm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was an eating machine, tearing big heaping chunks of meat from the bones and gulping down big hearty mouthfuls at the seams, and all with no lag time between the next go.  Glancing at the boy's stomach, he could see it begin to push out ever so slightly with every gulp of meat deposited into his abdomen, and still, he pressed on.  Suddenly, Hunter glanced down at his own stomach, and winced slightly.  He'd almost forgotten how filling these sauce drenched ribs could be sometimes.  Naruto caught this moment and smirked cockily before saying, \"Aww, what's the matter?  Is the big bad wolfie's itty bitty tummy full already?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Hunter didn't quite appreciate Naruto's taunting him, but then he stopped and thought about it: if Naruto was joking around with him, then maybe he was starting to loosen up around him afterall, which would make this escapade even better.  Still, Hunter wasn't one to be considered a light weight, despite his currently flat stomach.  And so, he began to pick up the pace a bit.  All the while, both their stomachs continued to expand little by little with each passing rib consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it, the ribs were all but reduced to a pile of bones on eat of their platters.  Licking his sauce smeared lips, Hunter sighed with relief and patted his belly happily.  To his surprise, his stomach no longer felt flat, but slightly concave, distending outward at a slight curve.  Naruto's own belly began to press slightly against his jacket, enough to satisfy anyone else.  Naruto on the other hand, was already sinking his fork and knife into his giant piece of steak.  Not wanting to appear weak, Hunter also began to dig into his sirloin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEat bite of steak was a blast of juicy, well seasoned flavor.  Of which, both enjoyed immensely as they continued to gorge themselves on steak.  As time went on, their pace began to slow down just slightly, and their bellies had begun to visibly distend.  Both took a brief moment to rest up and catch their breath.  \"Ohh man, now THESE people know how to cook a steak...\" said Naruto as he rubbed his bloated belly tenderly with both hands.  While not quite full, he was starting to get his (or in this case; Hunter's) money's worth with this place alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter however, was feeling a bit more strained as he groaned slightly and began to massage his stomach slowly from over his shirt.  His belly had expanded just slightly, creating a vaguely noticeable bump in his shirt, enough to lift his t-shirt slightly and expose a sliver of brown belly-fur from the bottom of his shirt.  It had been quite a while since he'd eaten so much at once, and his stomach needed a little more time to adjust than Naruto's did.  And sure enough, adjust it did, when from out of Hunter's maw, came a surprisingly loud burp.  Blushing, he immediately covered his mouth and apologetically said, \"Excuse me!  I-I'm terribly sorry about that!\" he said with embarrassment, much to Naruto's amusement as he laughed aloud at Hunter's embarrassment and expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, good one, wolf-boy!\" nudged Naruto to the still embarrassed wolf, \"But let's see you top this...\" and as those words left the blond's mouth, Naruto clutched his bloated abdomen with one hand and let out a belch loud and long enough to be mistaken; ironically enough, for a wolf's roar.  After a few deafening seconds which caused Hunter's ears to twitch slightly, Naruto smacked his lips and patted his belly happily.  \"Ahh, much better,\" said Naruto, giving his stomach more good bad.  He then glanced back at Hunter, and said, \"Oh, c'mon, even you gotta admit that your stomach's feeling a little better now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering his remark, Hunter placed his palm flat against his stomach.  It seemed to have deflated just slightly, and it did indeed feel much less tense.  Not only that, but if Hunter didn't know better, he was starting to feel hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't long before the two picked up their utensils and began to tackle the remaining steak. Hunter ate at a somewhat quick but nonetheless leisurely pace, savoring the taste of the steak. Naruto, as he had before, attacked his steak with a will, cutting off pieces, shoveling them into his mouth, chewing, and swallowing before repeating the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter watched with rapt attention even as he chewed his steak, still fascinated by the ease with which Naruto got himself into a groove and how smoothly he kept himself going. What was more fascinating, though, was how Naruto's belly continued to bulge slightly with every piece of steak that entered it, beginning to press a bit harder against his jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, look at him go,</i> Hunter mused, cutting another piece of steak for himself. <i>Hope he can keep this up...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Naruto dropped his utensils, the plate in front of him utterly depleted save for a few drops of sauce. Licking his lips, he leaned back in his chair, rubbing his belly with one hand. \"Gotta say,\" he admitted, looking across the table at Hunter, \"Ya did real good this time, wolfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, ignoring the nickname, smirked. \"Thanks,\" he replied, leaning back in his own chair with one hand resting upon his belly. He'd finished his steak a good bit before Naruto had, and the bump in his shirt had grown rounder and more apparent, forcing his shirt up a bit more to reveal more of his brown, furry belly. He blushed a bit at this realization, but shrugged it off; even if it had been a while, it's not like it hadn't happened to him before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to set that thought aside for the moment, he redirected his attention towards Naruto's belly, and couldn't help but grin a bit. The blonde's midsection now bulged quite noticeably against his jacket, and was now visibly distended. It was still completely concealed underneath the clothing, of course, but hopefully that would change soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter whistled (odd, considering he had a muzzle instead of human lips, but that's neither here nor there) and smiled at Naruto. \"You did real good yourself, Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting his belly, Naruto looked down at the swollen appendage. \"Heh; I did, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Hunter took his wallet out and plunked some more money down on the table. \"Sure did...\" He smirked. \"But, uh, you're not full yet, are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked. \"Heh; you wish! I've just gotten started!\" Pushing away from the table, getting to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWagging his tail, Hunter did the same. \"Now that's what I like to hear!\" He and Naruto began walking towards the exit. \"Alright, so where do ya wanna go next? There's a really good bakery nearby that's having a sale, but there's also a buffet if you're not sure what to have.\" He turned back towards Naruto, grinning. \"So, what'll it be, chief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFolding his arms, Naruto thought as they exited the restaurant. After a minute or two, he finally replied...</span></div></div>",

I'm gonna show you just how far I can REALLY go,\" decided Naruto, slapping his bloated belly for emphasis, causing it to jiggle just slightly from beneath his shirt and jacket.  Hunter's tail wagged happily upon hearing this.  \"Sounds great!  Let's get going then!\"  And so, the two headed off to the restaurant, still cradling their distended tummies along the way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the buffet, Hunter; like an excited child, trotted along to the waiter up front and said, \"Hiya!  Can we get a table for two, please?\"  Paying up front, the waiter nodded, then seated both to a nearby table.  The surplus of various aromas was overwhelming enough to almost make them forget how much steak and ribs they had just previously eaten.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, I was thinking...\" started Naruto, catching Hunter's attention, \"since this an all-you-can-eat place, how about we make it interesting this time around?\"  Hunter was intrigued, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, earlier you said you were a pretty big eater too.  And after that steak and rib combo, I'd say you kinda lived up to your word,\" responded Naruto, gesturing towards Hunter's distended stomach, causing him to chuckle slightly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how about we see which one of us is the bigger eater?\"<br>\r\n\"W-what, you mean, like an eating contest?\"<br>\r\n\"You know it!  I mean, that is unless you're chicken...\" as if to drive his point, Naruto began making clucking and other various / cliched chicken sounds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter wasn't quite sure at first, because if he were to go all out and completely stuff himself, then he may not be able to enjoy watching Naruto stuff himself fully the way he had hoped to see.  On the other hand, Naruto's got a thing for competition, and that competitive edge seemed to really drive him to outdo himself in a lot of his previous stuffing escapades.  Maybe it's what he needed to roll with if he wanted Naruto to REALLY go all out this time.  And so, Hunter smirked and said, \"You're on, then!  Whoever can put away the most plates is the biggest eater amongst us!\"  Naruto was excited to prove that he could not only out-eat anyone in Konoha, but a WOLF of all things, while Hunter; too, was excited, to see how far he could push Naruto on his consumption conquest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a plate, Hunter began to top his plate with various dumplings, some honey sesame breaded chicken, and some shrimp.  When he turned to Naruto however, he saw his plate had similar items, but in much higher volume.  His previous meal, while filling, was also notably smaller than Naruto's, and so to make sure it would be fair, he put an equally ridiculous amount of food atop his plate and sat back down.  Wasting no time, the two began to inhale the dumplings a few at a time.  For a buffet, the food was quite delicious, bursting with flavor in every bite.  \"Mmmm, pretty good dumplings!  Wonder if they've got any tempura.\" noted Naruto between bites.  Gulping a larger than usual mouthful down, Naruto sighed then got to work on his own pile of breaded chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dumplings alone began to cause Naruto's belly to stretch out even further, to the point where they were beginning to cause a bit of a strain against his attire.  But Naruto disregarded the strain and simply continued to eat, expanding just little by little as the food began to pile up within his gut.  Hunter had also made some impressive progress.  Having just finished his immense pile of dumplings, Hunter sighed and leaned back against his chair, rubbing his belly in satisfaction.  Glancing down, he began to see more of his bare fur coated belly exposed from beneath the visible but small bulge emanating from his torso.  \"Mmm, they ARE pretty tasty, aren't they?\" said Hunter.  Naruto simply nodded as he continued to ingest more chicken.  Not wanting to fall behind, Hunter also got to work on his chicken, at a surprisingly quicker pace than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed, but eventually, their plates were licked squeaky clean.  Both Naruto and Hunter merely sat for a moment, rubbing their aching bellies in an effort to coax the stress from eating so much.  Between the two, Naruto's stomach had distended to a more noticeable size than Hunter's, but all things considered, he wasn't doing half bad.  After a few moments, the two hoisted themselves from their seats and got themselves drinks.  Like before, Hunter poured himself a cup of Orange Juice while Naruto poured himself a bubbly cup of cola, then set them on the table before heading back for their next plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would their next plate consist of?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take long for Naruto to find his next course; specifically, a truly gigantic bowl of ramen that easily dwarfed Ichiraku's biggest bowls; it would have easily fed a group of four or five. Grinning, he picked it up, struggling a bit under its weight, much to the shock of the attending cook. Hunter, seeing this, followed suit and grabbed a giant bowl of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shot him an odd look. \"Huh? You're getting ramen too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged, even as the two began walking back to their table. \"Hey, I've never had ramen before, and I figured this is a good opportunity to start.\" He leaned his muzzle in close to the steaming bowl and took a deep whiff. \"Ah...smells delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned, leaning in close to his own bowl and sniffing it. \"Maybe, but it probably still won't be as good as...\" He suddenly stopped as the smell assailed his nostrils. <i>No way...couldn't be...</i> Beside him, Hunter was doing his best not to grin. Reaching their table, they sat down, with Hunter picking up a pair of chopsticks and splitting them, but Naruto continued to stare at the bowl of ramen, sniffing it once more. \"Nah, couldn't be...\" Naruto murmured to himself even as he prepared his own chopsticks. Hunter watched him, a knowing smirk on his muzzle even as he reached his chopsticks into his own bowl and drew some of the noodles up to his muzzle, blowing on them to cool them off a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively, Naruto did the same, bringing a few noodles to his lips, blowing on them, and slurping them up. As soon as they traveled down his gullet, his eyes bulged. \"No way...is this...Ichiraku's?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Hunter slurped up a few of his own noodles, tail wagging at the taste. \"Got it in one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but how...\" Naruto stammered, even as he drew up a large helping of noodles and toppings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled, taking a swig of his orange juice. \"Remember I said I had a surprise you? I made arrangements for this buffet to serve Ichiraku's, at least for the day.\" He gave Naruto a surprisingly apologetic look. \"I kinda figured, seeing as how I gipped you outta going to Ichiraku's in the first place, I kinda owed it to ya, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...thanks,\" Naruto finally said, oddly touched. He slurped up his new helping of noodles, not taking his eyes off the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged, smiling. \"Hey, I'm a lotta things: crazy, weird, and without a lick of common sense, but I still like to pride myself on being a nice guy...or wolf.\" He drew up some noodles and topping, slurping them into his muzzle. \"Oh wow, this is really good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Naruto shook himself out of his shocked state and grinned. \"I know, right? Ichiraku's is the best!\" Giggling, he dove back into the gigantic bowl, this time with gusto. Hunter, seeing this, got a fierce gleam in his eye and followed suit, slurping up noodles and various topping, even as he marveled at how good they tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued on at this pace, slurping up noodles and toppings like there was no tomorrow. And, considering how much food was already in their bellies, it didn't take long for it to start to show, much to Hunter's delight; for every mouthful of ramen that entered the blond's gullet, his already distended belly bulged a tiny bit, creating more strain against his clothing. And, as he continued to gulp down the contents of the massive bowl, it only continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly curious, Hunter let one hand wander down to his stomach, even as his other occupied itself with scooping up more ramen. Sure enough, with every mouthful <i>he</i> swallowed, his tummy bulged a little bit, the shape slowly growing bigger and more prominent, in addition to slowly lifting his shirt further up. Blushing a bit, Hunter nonetheless shook his head and returned his full attention to his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes ticked by, with both ninja and wolf attacking their ramen, their stomachs slowly swelling to accommodate it all; still, at this point, they'd barely even made a dent in the massive bowl. Choosing to ignore his own growth for the time being, Hunter focused on Naruto, even as he devoured his own meal. To his delight, Naruto's stomach continued to grow steadily, pushing more and more against his jacket. <i>Ooh...won't be long now...</i> Hunter thought giddily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, as Naruto gulped down his latest mouthful, a couple of the teeth of jacket came apart, the first of many losing battles his clothes would fight before the day was out. Feeling this, and looking slightly puzzled, Naruto looked down at his stomach. His eyes widened when he saw the teeth pried apart, but he shrugged and kept on going, not wanting to lose his groove. A few more gulps, and a few more teeth popped apart, this time exposing a bit of the black t-shirt he wore underneath. Several more gulps, and a couple more teeth gave up the ghost, showing a bit more of the black shirt, as well as a hint of flesh beneath it; evidently, his t-shirt had begun to be affected even before his jacket had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter continued to watching, his tail wagging. <i>Oh wow, look at him go...and we've barely made any progress on the bowls yet!</i> He continued to slurp up his own noodles, watching Naruto as he did so. <i>This is gonna be epic, I can tell!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With every mouthful gulped down, more and more, their respective bellies continued to distend outward little by little.  Hunter's stomach, while smaller than Naruto's continued to bloat outward, growing rounder and larger with every ridiculously large mouthful gulped down into his gullet, exposing more of his furry brown belly as his t-shirt continued to lift from the increased mass.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Naruto's notably larger stomach only pushed outward more and more, causing more of the teeth in his jacket to separate as it continued to open more and more.  His t-shirt had already begun to rise up from beneath his jacket, to the point where more flesh began to expose itself from beneath Naruto's bottom open jacket.  Hunter was still too occupied with filling his own growing gullet to see how much of an impact the ramen had on Naruto's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of this, the bowls had reached their half way points, and both Naruto and Hunter, stopped to catch their breath, and in unison, burped loudly, before resting their hands atop their semi-exposed bellies, and sighing with relief.  \"My word, no wonder you like Ichiraku's so much.  That's the best ramen I've ever eaten in my life!' explained Hunter as he licked his maw happily.  Smiling, Naruto nodded and said, \"You got that right!  Man oh man, I think this'll be the most Ichiraku's I ever wolf down in one sitting.\"  Hunter chuckled at the 'wolfing down' remark, then continued to rub his distended gut firmly until he finally noticed how distended Naruto's belly had become.  His eyes widened with joy as Naruto's stomach had grown to the point where it looked like he had swallowed a small beach ball.  His t-shirt had risen to expose flesh just below his belly-button, and his jacket had all but completely split open, save for a few zipper teeth near the top.  \"Wow, that ramen really did a number on you, didn't it?\" said Hunter as he gestured towards Naruto's balloon belly.  Looking down, Naruto smirked and gave his belly a hearty slap then said, \"Haha, well Ichiraku's tends to do that.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can still finish the rest?  Afterall, we're only half way in.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, man, when it comes to Ichiraku's, I never leave a bowl unfinished.  Even if that bowl just happens to be family sized...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed for a moment and continued to rest their swollen stomachs.  Then Naruto said, \"Y'know, I gotta say, despite how things started, this is actually turning out to be a pretty awesome night.\"  Hunter's tail wagged as he smiled and said, \"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure!  Not a lot of people...or animals would go so out of their way to treat me to a feast this epic, let alone actually manage to keep up with me when it comes to eating Ichiraku's,\" responded Naruto as he gestured Hunter's own belly, causing him to rub the back of his fuzzy head, flattered by Naruto's remark.  \"...You're alright, Hunter.\"<br>\r\nHunter smiled grateful for that remark, and very gratefully said, \"Thank you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto and Hunter only spent a couple more minutes resting their stomachs before diving back into their ramen with gusto, continuing to gulp down massive mouthfuls of ramen and toppings. And, as before, their bellies bulged out with every mouthful, doing their best to make room for the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's rounded, furry tummy slowly grew larger and more apparent, forcing his shirt further up and exposing a bit more of his brown-furred midsection; any further, and it wouldn't be long before his furred-over belly-button would be showing as well. Midway through his current mouthful, Hunter winced as the waistband of his shorts started to cut into his stomach, but he pressed on; he probably had a little while before he'd need to unbutton them, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, seeing that Hunter wasn't letting up, grinned and continued on with his meal as well. With every swallow, his larger stomach bulged out more and more, continuing to lift his shirt up. A few bulges later, and the black article of clothing exposed his stomach from half of his belly-button downwards. Hunter, noting this with glee, picked up his pace, eager to get to the same point. Not one to be outdone, Naruto returned the grin and quickened his pace as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigger and bigger their stomachs bloated, and higher and higher their shirts rose up. Naruto's belly button continued to peek out more and more, until finally, his shirt had risen up to expose it in its entirety. Hunter, on the other hand, was currently where Naruto had just been, half of his furred-over belly button poking out for the whole world to see. Undeterred by this, the two went even faster, consuming their Ichiraku's like there was no tomorrow. Quicker and quicker their shirts slid up, and tighter and tighter their waistbands became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, all that remained of their bowls was the frankly formidable quantity of broth left within them. Rubbing their stomachs (which, in Hunter's case, exposed his furry navel in its entirety, and in Naruto's case, a good few inches above it), they seized the massive bowls, opened their mouths, and tilted the bowls back, letting the savory liquid flow down their gullets. Almost like water being poured into a balloon, their bellies slowly inflated to accommodate it, pushing out more and making their shirts ride even higher up. In addition, the strain on the respective waistline steadily increased, but they ignored it for the moment; they were doing too good to stop now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a minute or two of gulping down the broth, they slammed their bowls down, sighed, and leaned back in their chairs, massaging their bloated bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...\" Hunter moaned, rubbing his belly with one hand while resting his other arm on the chair. \"That...that was the best ramen I've ever tasted.\" He burped, but only smiled and licked his muzzle at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, choosing to massage his gut with both hands, merely grinned. \"Well, it's Ichiraku's; of course its amazing.\" He shook his exposed belly, giggling a bit at how the broth inside it caused it to slosh a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled, but winced as a sharp pain in his waistline interrupted him; his shorts were beginning to become unbearably tight. Naruto, likewise, groaned and massaged his belly as a sudden bolt of pain shot through his waistline as well. However, neither of them made any move to unbutton their pants; as at ease as they had become, they were still in a competitive spirit, and in no mood to show any weakness to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat there for a few more minutes, gently massaging their exposed tummies before, with a groan, they hoisted themselves up out of their chairs, their guts shaking and sloshing a bit. Blushing, they nonetheless made their way back to the buffet, grabbing plates and loading them up with all manner of sweets: cake, cookies, dango, ice cream, and every other baked good and dessert known to man. Almost staggering under the weight of both their plates and their midsections, they lurched back to their table and practically dropped their plates down, plopping their rumps in their seats shortly afterwards. Gently rubbing their bellies, they burped a few times to make some room before diving into their plates.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wasting no time at all, the two immediately began to consume the sweet contents on their plates.  Hunter was shoveling as many cookies as he could fit in his paws right into his mouth, chewing on them and gulping down big hearty mouthfuls before shoveling even more into his mouth.  Naruto on the other hand, was stuffing his face with a hearty bowl of ice cream, shoving one mouthful after another.  After a few bites, he stopped and winced at the ensuing brain freeze, earning an amused chuckle from Hunter before he regained composure and resumed scarfing down more cookies.  After a moment, Naruto got back to work on his ice cream, suffering through it as best he could.  All the while, both their stomachs continued to push outward with every other mouthful, causing further strains against their pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, they had both completed the first wave of desserts, and immediately moved onto the next wave.  Hunter and Naruto immediately decided on their cakes and wasted no time scarfing big heaping chunks from their forks into their respective mouths.  The vanilla cake was heavy on cream, occasionally spilling over each others faces.  Occasionally, they'd stop and notice the smears on their faces, end would end up giggling like children.  Naruto would wipe his face with a napkin while Hunter's tongue was long enough to simply lick the frosting from his face and resume eating.  Their bellies continued to expand all the while, causing the front of both their pants to creak up under the vast pressure from all the added weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they had both finished that rich slice of cake, they needed to stop for a moment and catch their breath, whilst rubbing their aching bellies in an effort to sooth their discomfort.  Burping deeply into his paw, Hunter groaned as he rubbed his bloated furry belly firmly all over.  \"Ugh, I honestly don't think I've ever eaten this much before in my life...\" said the wolf as he took a drink of his orange juice to try and cool his belly down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, don't tell me you're calling it quits now, Wolfie...\" responded Naruto as he continued to massage his own bloated midsection.  Still in competitive spirits, Hunter put his glass down and said, \"Sorry, Naruto, but you're not gonna beat me THAT easily.\"  Smirking, Naruto nodded then took a hearty gulp of his soda, causing his belly to expand outward slightly more due to the vast ingestion of carbonation entering his stomach at once.  The button to his zipper was on the verge of snapping right off.  \"Glad to hear it.  I mean, I'm gonna beat you regardless, but I'm hoping you'll at least make it a challenge for me first,\" said Naruto smugly before a huge belch erupted from the young ninja's mouth, causing his belly to deflate just slightly, just enough to decrease the tension to the waist of his pants for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, trust me, that's not going to be a problem,\" responded Hunter before the competitive edge he was working got the better of him, and led to him chugging the rest of his orange juice in one go, also causing his belly to distend outward and strain the button to his khakis.  He then clutched his bloated belly and let a slightly louder burp than Naruto's.  The sheer amount of gas exiting his belly also caused his stomach to deflate just enough before tearing into the waist of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed before the two burst into complete laughter, causing their bloated bellies to slosh around in the process.  \"Haha, NICE one, man!\" said Naruto before high fiving Hunter, causing his tail to wag happily.  \"Oh man, first I get to eat more Ichiraku's than I've ever eaten in one sitting, now I'm having a burping contest with a different species?  This night just gets more and more awesome as it goes!\"  Hunter smiled warmly at the remark, then said, \"I'm very happy to hear that, Naruto.  Thank you.  Now...you ready to lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScoffing, Naruto confidently said, \"Yeah, about as ready as you are to have your fur completely shaved off in the winter!\"  Hunter stopped and grimaced for a second, trying to suppress an unfortunate moment in his youth where that had in fact happened to him, then regained his composure.  The two then immediately dove into the third wave of their desserts, all the while straining the waist to their pants even further.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto and Hunter both winced as they attacked a few massive slices of pie, sharp bolts of pain shooting through their waistlines as their stomachs swelled and pressed harder against their pants and shorts, respectively. Somewhere at the back of their heads, their minds screamed at them to stop, to unbutton their pants, before they ended up regretting it. However, their competitive spirits were at full blaze, and they soldiered on, ignoring these very well-meaning warnings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were maintaining an even pace with each other, something neither of them failed to notice. To this end, their unoccupied hands/paws reached out as they used the occupied one to keep shoveling pie into their waiting maws, their empty hands finding a spoon and scooping copious amounts of ice cream into their mouths alongside the pie. This created a rather pleasant pie a la mode flavor, but they barely noticed; they were too focused on cramming their maws and getting ahead of the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite their best efforts, they still maintained an even pace with one another. All the while, their stomachs continued to grow, pushing their shirts further up, and creating even more strain on their pants in the process. Soon, their pants buttons began creaking audibly, clear indicators that they were losing the struggle. Then, they began quivering violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as another huge mouthful of pie and ice cream traveled down their gullets, it finally happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an audible 'POP!', Naruto's pants button sailed off, flying under the table and striking Hunter in the foot. The young ninja felt an immense sense of relief as the button vacated itself and a few of the teeth of his fly undid themselves, followed by sheer embarrassment at the realization of what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, as Naruto's button hit Hunter's foot, the wolf yelped, the motion causing his shorts button to bust as well. Luckily, it flew in an upwards arc, striking the underside of the table and clattering harmlessly to the floor. As the pressure in his waistline released, Hunter sighed with relief, his long tongue lolling out the side of his mouth. \"Oh man...\" he moaned, dropping his utensils and leaning back as he rubbed his belly. \"That feels so much better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, dropping his own fork and spoon, gaped at the wolf. \"How can you be so calm?!\" Naruto exclaimed, feeling around his waistline and blushing intensely. \"We just busted our buttons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter waved dismissively back. \"Eh, don't sweat it; I know a great seamstress with great prices; we'll get our pants fixed up after this is all over and done with. More to the point...\" He leaned forward as much as his belly would allow and smirked. \"Doesn't that feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought for a moment. \"Well, yeah; my stomach doesn't hurt as much anymore...\" He fixed Hunter with a fierce grin. \"...which means I can just keep goin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed heartily, picking up his utensils again. \"That's the spirit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled before a thought occured to him. \"Just one question...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter paused, a large forkful of pie halfway to his muzzle. \"Yeah, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you goin' commando or what?\" Naruto asked, causing Hunter to splutter a bit at this. \"I mean, since our buttons are gone, there's nothin' to stop our guts from forcing our zippers open, and I just wanna make sure I don't see any more than I need to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, still a bit shocked at the question, nodded. \"Don't worry, I'm wearing undies.\" He smirked, plopping his forkful into his mouth. \"Just hope you are too..\" he retorted through a mouthful of pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blushed. \"O-of course I am! What do you take me for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head and smiling, Hunter swallowed his mouthful before he resumed going to town on his ice cream and pie. Not one to be outdone, Naruto quickly followed suit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both Naruto and Hunter continued to wolf down the remnants of deserts atop their plates, as their bellies continued to expand outward free of any obstructions.  The two devoured their pastries and various desserts at an equally quick pace, due to the extra space their busted pants now permitted them.  Scooping up bits of ice cream alongside his fork of pie, Hunter continued to ingest both at once, while Naruto would grab a handful of dango pieces and just stuff it right into his eager maw.  Spending a good while chewing the many sweets in his mouth, and taking the briefest of moments to enjoy the plethora of flavor each one emitted within his mouth, he would swallow a big heaping mouthful and send it straight into his growing gullet before stuffing yet another handful of dango into his jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more time passed, their ridiculously loaded plates began to lighten as more and more of the deserts were going straight into the bloated stomachs of the ninja and wolf.  All the while, their bellies continued to expand outward just a little more than they already had, to the point where both looked like they had swallowed medicine balls, give or take a few size differences between them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after several seemingly endless minutes, the two had licked their plates clean, and were now resting against their chairs, blissfully rubbing their ridiculously bloated stomachs slowly in satisfaction and in an effort to coax the strain of overindulgence.  \"Man...I don't think I've ever eaten this much in my life....\" said a beyond stuffed Hunter as he rubbed his paw all across his domed out belly as best he could.  Smiling, Naruto drummed his fingers atop his even larger fleshy globe of a gut and said, \"You're telling me, wolfie...can't even remember the last time I felt this full...nor can I remember the last time ANYBODY managed to keep up with me all the way through in a binge like this.\"  Wagging his tail feebly, Hunter chuckled, patting his belly happily and said, \"Glad I could give you a run for your effort.  I suppose we should call it a draw then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Naruto slowly hoisted himself and his distended gut from his seat.  Struggling slightly under his newfound weight, he headed over to the vending machine.  Curious, Hunter looked back at Naruto's direction and watched as he grabbed two empty pitchers usually used to serve entire tables of people and began to fill them both up with cola.  He raised an eyebrow curiously as Naruto brought both pitchers back to the table.  Glancing at them, Hunter noted that they were both an equal amount of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this for?\" asked Hunter, to which Naruto replied with, \"Think of this as the tie breaker.  See, any time Kiba and I would have these little eating competitions to see who could eat the most or the fastest, more often than not, we'd both end up at one tie after another.  So, what we'd do if ever we tied, is we'd take these giant pitchers of soda, and just chug away.\"  Hunter gulped nervously at the concept, \"and whoever finished their pitcher of cola first would be the winner.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, he slid Hunter his pitcher as he glanced down nervously at the bubbly drink and hesitantly said, \"Umm, actually, Naruto, I've never been a huge fan of soda.  That's why I always settle for things like juice or milk whenever I go out.\"  Naruto scoffed then said, \"Oh please.  If you kept up this far, I'm sure you're more than tough enough to handle a little bit of cola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was taken back for a moment.  It was very seldom anyone ever called him tough, which; cheesy enough, made his tail wag just slightly with appreciation.  Then at that moment, yet another thought entered his mind.  All that carbonation and liquid would bloat Naruto's belly up to a whole new level, ESPECIALLY if he's going to drink it as fast as he can.  If it meant he'd have to suffer through the bubbly beverage to get Naruto going again, then it would at least be worth it.  And so, Hunter smiled and grabbed one of the two pitchers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, the first to drink all their soda wins.  Ready?  Chug!\"  With that, both lifted the pitchers to their lips and began to chug heaping bounds of cola all at once.  Hunter visibly winced at first at the excess carbonation floating and sizzling atop his tongue and heading straight to his ever expanding belly, but after a little while, the immediate dislike began to wade away.  Instead, he found himself chugging at a faster rate than before, with a smile slowly creeping over his maw, which Naruto caught as he chugged, causing him to smirk too, as he couldn't help but feel a little proud of the wolf for getting over his dislike of the beverage so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Hunter put his pitcher down and gasped for breath. \"Wow, that's actually some pretty sweet stuff!\"  He exclaimed, then clutched his belly firmly with one hand, \"but man is it doing a number on my stomach...\"  As soon as those words exited Hunter's mouth, he paused for a moment and let out a sharp, bassy belch, followed by a much softer burp immediately afterward.  \"Excuse me,\" he muttered as Naruto stopped for a breather, and promptly let out a massive burp of his own shortly after, followed by a sigh of relief and him heartily slapping his belly, before smirking at the wolf and saying, \"Admit it, feels kinda good letting all that air outta your belly at once, doesn't it?\"  Hunter thought for a moment, then shrugged, \"Yeah, it kinda does.  Hehe, quite fun too!\"<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!  Now, less talky-more drinky!\"  With that, Naruto immediately resumed chugging from his pitcher.  Caught off guard, Hunter stumbled a tad then continued to chug away at his pitcher as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had only reached about a quarter of the way into their pitchers, still keeping at an even keel.  Occasionally, the two would stop to catch their breath, rub their bellies and burp loudly to make more room for their drinks, then resume drinking in a rather unison fashion, but there would still only be one victor...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Naruto and Hunter continued to chug away at their pitchers, their bellies steadily swelled as the carbonated liquid entered them, pushing out even further and growing nearer to the table. By this point, both their flies had been forced all the way open, but their positions, as well as their growing guts, kept their undergarments concealed for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisregarding this, the two kept chugging away, once again causing their already-engorged midsections to swell up comically, growing ever closer to touching the table, in addition to creating a bit of strain on their fully-opened flies and the side seams. Luckliy, considering only their midsections were growing, the garments would still stay on; however, the seams probably wouldn't make it out intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both reached the halfway point, Naruto lowered his pitcher to belch loudly and create some more room in his gut. As he did so, he frowned. Was it just him, or did his belly-button feel a little...weird? Shrugging at this thought, he took a breath and lifted his pitcher back to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, even as he put his pitcher back down for a quick breather, couldn't help but notice this. He grinned, and his tail wagged; if what he thought was about to happen happened, it'd be unbelievably epic.. Licking his chops, he promptly lifted his pitcher back up to his muzzle and resumed going to town on it, eager not to fall behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as time went on and the levels of liquid in their pitchers steadily went downwards, Hunter could feel himself beginning to flag; he was chugging for shorter periods of time, taking longer breaks, and burping more often before going back to drinking. Naruto, seeing this, pressed his advantage; he chugged for as long as he possibly could until he felt like he'd bust, slammed the pitcher down, let loose with a titanic belch to free up some room. As he did so, he couldn't help but notice; yes, something definitely felt off about his navel, almost like there was kind of an odd pressure there. This realization caused him to frown a bit, but upon noticing Hunter once again tilting the pitcher up to his muzzle, he disregarded it for the moment and went back to chugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of this, Hunter was now noticeably lagging behind; his pitcher had noticeably more soda left in it than Naruto's. In fact, the level of liquid in Naruto's pitcher was going down faster by the minute, feeding into his ever-expanding belly; it had even started to press against the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, noticing this, tried to put on a burst of speed, but no matter how much he burped, rested, or breathed, his distended stomach would accept no more cola. Groaning, Hunter placed his pitcher back on the table, leaning back in his chair and massaging his stuffed tummy with both paws, unable to repress a childish giggle at the way it sloshed, thanks to all the soda inside of it. Burping softly, he looked up to continue watching Naruto's progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his delight, Naruto's stomach had swollen even bigger, his navel peeking up over the table even as his belly pressed visibly against it. His eyes went to the pitcher; it was almost empty, and Naruto showed no signs of slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his chops to get a few stray drops of cola off, Hunter watched eagerly as the cola continued to flow down Naruto's throat and into his belly. Bigger and bigger it swelled (and tighter and tighter Naruto's belly-button felt, though Hunter had no way of knowing that,) until, finally, Naruto tilted the pitcher all the way back and let the last of the soda flow into his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo things happened in the instant following that. First, his stomach bulged just a little more. Second, well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter let out a little 'squee' of delight while Naruto sighed in relief as the young ninja's navel popped out wards, sticking out and wobbling about for the whole world to see. Slamming the now-empty pitcher back down, he let loose with a might belch and leaned back in his seat, rubbing his engorged tummy with one hand and inspecting his newly-inverted navel with the other. \"Oh man, that felt amazing...\" he prodded and poked the protrusion a bit, giggling a bit. \"Heh, that feels kinda funny...\" As he did this, he looked up at Hunter. \"Nice job, Hunter; ya didn't win, but ya gave it a damn good try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Hunter rubbed the back of his head. \"Heh heh, thanks!\" This was interrupted by a massive belch tearing its way out of his muzzle. \"Ugh...I think we mighta overdone it a bit.\" He indicated the exit with his head. \"Ya wanna head back to the inn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto belched as well, scooting his chair away from the table. \"Yeah; I'm kinda gettin' tired anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, both of them hoisted themselves out of their chair, holding their massive bellies as the did so. Groaning a bit, they staggered towards the exit, trying their best to ignore the stares of the other patrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was slow going, what with the slow pace they were forced to take, but eventually, they made it back to Naruto's room at the inn. Sighing in relief, Naruto waddled over to his bed, tossed his open jacket off, and collapsed backwards onto the bed; it creaked under the weight of his midsection, but that was all. Chuckling a bit at this, Hunter staggered over to one of the closets, opened it, and pulled out a futon. Laying it on the floor beside Naruto's bed, he carefully got down to the floor,laid on his side on top of the futon, and rolled onto his back, his huge belly sticking up into the air like Naruto's was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short amount of time, they had both fallen asleep in a food coma nap, their snores the only sound between them.</span></div></div>",

Wincing from the bright light, he eventually sat up and yawned heartily as he stretched his arms up, and eventually brought one down to scratch his stomach from under his shirt.  Looking down, he lifted his shirt up and felt his stomach more closely to see that it had done the seemingly impossible, and digested virtually all of his immense meal from the night prior, and had returned to his previously flat state from before, with just a tiny amount of fat layered down to his lower abdomen, near and below his once again normal innie-belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping his shirt back down, he stretched a little more, then rose from his bed.  Groggily, he rubbed his eyes and sluggishly looked around the room, to see no sign of Hunter.  Until the door to the bathroom opened, and out came a wide awake and recently showered Hunter just putting on a new shirt.  Turning, he spotted Naruto, and with a smile said in a tone that only a morning person could have, \"Morning, sunshine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin',\" mumbled Naruto, as he rubbed his face, still trying to wake himself.  Glancing down, he saw that, like himself; Hunter's stomach seemed to had digested virtually all of his meal over the course of their deep slumber and had returned to its' once again flat state.  \"Guess I'm not the only one who digests stuff fast.\"  Smirking, Hunter patted his stomach and said, \"Guess not.  But hey, that's us wolves for ya!  Still, that was some gooooood eating, wasn't it?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled, still practically tasting the many flavors from last nights binge.  \"Suuuuuure was.  Hell, I haven't even that good in ages!\" said Naruto, as he rubbed his stomach reminiscently.  Then continued with, \"Y'know, speaking of which, I don't think I properly thanked you for that.  I mean, I know we kinda got off on the wrong foot, but it was still really cool of you to treat me to so many great eats like that.  So, thank you very much, Hunter.\"  Hunter smiled, brushing the back of his head, and said, \"My absolute pleasure, Naruto.  Still,\" his smile faded away a bit as he continued, \"I feel real bad for that ambush before.  I didn't really think there was any other way I'd get you to go eat and hang out last night, but that doesn't excuse what I did.  So, I'm really sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Naruto waved his hand dismissively and said, \"Oh, don't worry about the dart thing, I'm waaaaaaaay over that.  But do it again, and I'll shave off your fur and leave you in an igloo.\"  Laughing slightly, Hunter nodded and said, \"You got yourself a deal.\"  Still, his smile wavered a bit, as he looked away, almost somber, catching Naruto's attention.  \"Hey, you okay, man?\" asked Naruto, to which Hunter simply nodded, then said, \"It's just that, I have associates and employers and all that, but I...well, I don't really have a lot of friends.  And, getting to see what it was like last night; even if just for a night, felt nice...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Naruto walked up to the distraught wolf then held his hand out, much to Hunter's surprise.  \"Well, Hunter, you've got a friend now.\"  Hunter didn't know what to say.  Finally, he shook Naruto's hand and smiled, completely humbled and grateful.  \"Thank you, Naruto.\"   He replied, tail wagging happily, much to Naruto's amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment was quickly halted when a loud rumbling emanated from within the room.  Chuckling sheepishly, Naruto placed a hand on his noisy tummy and said, \"Hehe, guess last nights feasting didn't sate me as long as I thought it would.\"  Suddenly there was a knocking at the door.  Smiling, Hunter said, \"I didn't think it would.  That's why I took the liberty of ordering us a little breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, a hospitality worker came in with a large cart with several silver platters and placed them on the room table before Hunter paid him, and left a generous tip then left the two with a hearty breakfast to enjoy.  Lifting the covers off the platters, Naruto's jaw gaped at the sight of strawberry waffles, stacks of buttery pancakes, piles of bacon and sausage, scrambled eggs, omelets, and french toast, with a pitcher of milk and OJ to wash it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter....I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the two dug in.  </span></div></div>",

Slowly, he brought a hand up over his still-closed eyes. \"Too bright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling, he sluggishly slung his legs over the edge of the bed, his upper body still lying on it. With a great deal of grunting, Naruto slowly sat up, scratching his side as he did so. Yawning, he slowly blinked as eyes open and looked out the window. \"Morning already?\" Yawning again, he looked down at his stomach. His metabolism had kicked into overdrive, and his belly appeared as flat as it had been before this whole thing had started. Curious, Naruto felt under his shirt; yes, there was a little bit of extra skin around his belly-button (which had receded to its natural, innie state), but it was nothing some training wouldn't take care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly coming more awake, Naruto looked over to the other side of the bed, and couldn't help but crack a smile at the sight that greeted him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike him, Hunter's metabolism had worked its magic, and his furry belly now appeared perfectly flat. He was sprawled out on the futon, his limbs and tail splayed haphazardly about, his muzzle hanging open and his tongue lolling out the side. He had apparently flailed around in his sleep, as his shirt was rumpled up and fully exposed his now-flat, brown-furred tummy. His shorts, sans a button, had their fly completely unzipped, revealing him to be wearing dark blue boxers with some kind of large shape down the side that he couldn't quite make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled, before feeling a draft and remembering, to his embarrassment, that his pants were in the same state, and were doubtlessly exposing his light blue, heart-patterned undies. Blushing heavily, he quickly despaired that he didn't have a spare set of clothes, but then something occured to him: if Hunter had been thoughtful enough to arrange for the buffet to serve Ichiraku's and generally just being a nice guy (or wolf), he probably would have packed him some spare clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis in mind, he walked towards the closet and opened it; indeed, there were a variety of shirts hanging up, as well as several pants. Naruto smiled warmly, before he took a closer look. <i>Wait a minute...these are my clothes!</i> He scowled. <i>Did he...did he break into my place?</i> His face contorted angrily, but as he thought about it, the anger slowly faded. <i>Well, he doesn't seem like the kinda guy who'd steal my stuff...Besides, I really like these clothes, and I'd probably be screwed if he didn't grab them...</i> He shrugged, perusing the closet. <i>Eh, I'll ask him about it when he wakes up.</i> Eventually, he'd selected a teen-sized version of an outfit he'd liked to wear as a kid; specifically, dark blue/black trousers and a white, short-sleeved T-shirt with a stylized flame symbol on the front and sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds, he'd slipped them on. Satisfied, he looked over at Hunter, who was still sleeping. He briefly considered waking him up, but decided against it; he'd been nice to him, so it was only fair he returned the favor. Smiling, he turned...and nearly tripped on something on the floor. Cursing, he looked down to see that it was a duffel bag with a large crescent moon on the side. Curious, he knelt down and unzipped it, rummaging through its contents. It was mostly an assortment of shorts and t-shirts, along with basic toiletries and some objects that were completely foreign to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, he lifted one out-a plastic rectangle with some sort of screen on hit- and lifted it up, examining it. To his surprise, there was an assortment of buttons on it. Not having the faintest idea what any of them did, he tentatively pressed one. Almost immediately, the screen flared to life. Eyes widening, Naruto took in the picture; it was Hunter, his arm draped companionably over the shoulders of a young, black-haired man, the latter's arm draped about his shoulders as well. Both had goofy grins on their faces, and were waving at the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at it. \"Huh, must be a friend of his...\" Tentatively, he touched the screen; to his surprise, another picture was brought up, this one of Hunter and several...odd individuals around him. Some looked at ease, others looked, eager, but others just looked pissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed. \"Heh, wonder what the story behind that is...\" Shrugging he touched the screen again, bringing up more pictures: Hunter with all kinds of strange creatures and people, some looking happier to be in the picture than others. Naruto raised an eyebrow. \"Huh, interesting company he keeps...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleepy-sounding voice caused Naruto to jump, and he had to fumble about to keep the object from dropping. Eyes widening, he turned his head behind him; Hunter was starting to sit up, his shirt falling down to once again cover his brown-furred belly. He squinted, his glasses askew. \"What're you doing with my phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phone?\" Naruto looked at the device again; he'd seen phones before, but none like this. \"S-sorry about that; I didn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Hunter yawned, adjusting his glasses as he did so. \"Hey, so long as ya didn't break it and you're not plannin' to steal it, I got no complaints.\" Getting to his feet/paws, Hunter stretched his arms high in the air, letting loose with another, more monstrous yawn. \"So, ya see anything good on there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Naruto thought for a moment. \"Well, first I saw a photo of you posing with this human friend of yours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's ears perked up. \"Kai?\" He smiled warmly. \"Yeah, he's my best buddy; he wanted to come, but he was busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting his head in confusion, Naruto continued. \"Then, when I touched the screen, I kept on getting photos of you with really weird people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed, scratching his side. \"Ah, yes. I travel a lot, so I meet a lot of folks. Some are friends, some are acquaintances, and some...\" to Naruto's surprise, the wolf shuddered. \"...well, let's just say you gotta be REAL careful with interdimensional warlords, hostile aliens, and all those nasty kinds of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gaped, his jaw opening. \"Huh...wha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed heartily. \"I'll tell ya about it later.\" He looked down at his shorts. \"First, I gotta get changed.\" Strolling over to his duffel, he pulled out another pair of khaki shorts and a maroon tank top. Nodding in satisfaction and standing up, he set his new clothes to the side...then he peeled his shirt off and tossed it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes bugged out, and he jumped to his feet. \"Hunter, the hell!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter gave Naruto a smug grin. \"Chill, Uzumaki.\" Reaching down to his waist, he slid his shorts off, leaving him only in his boxer shorts, which bore the same crescent moon as his duffel on the side. \"I only wear clothes 'cause I like 'em; when I'm home in the woods, I go au naturale. I am a wolf, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at him in horror. \"You mean you go naked sometimes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged. \"Yeah. It's not a big deal, though; like I said, I might be anthropomorphic, but I'm still a wolf. Besides,\" he added chuckling, \"my fur covers my body in such a way that...certain things are concealed from view, so you wouldn't have that to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's mind goggled, still trying to process everything. \"Yeah? Well...\" He thought for a moment before continuing. \"Just put your damn clothes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked. \"As you wish.\" With that, he pulled his khaki shorts on and slipped his tank top over his head. He looked down at himself, smiling. \"Yep, that about does it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Naruto's stomach let out a noisy growl, followed by Hunter's own.They both started. \"So, uh,\" Hunter offered, scratching the back of his head, \"ya wanna get something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto considered for a moment before replying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Actually, I don't really feel like going out just yet,\" shrugged Naruto.  Hunter nodded then said, \"I gotcha.  One of those lazy-don't-do-nothing mornings, right?\"  Scratching the back of his head, Naruto chuckled and nodded.  \"Something like that.  Actually, I was kinda wondering how the room service in this place was.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you kiddin' me?  The food here's good enough to be in restaurants,\" boasted Hunter eagerly.<br>\r\n\"Well then it's good enough to be in our stomachs,\" said Naruto with a smirk as he patted his hungry stomach in anticipation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Hunter nodded and held his paw out towards Naruto, confusing him slightly until he realized he still had Hunter's phone on him.  \"Oh right, s-sorry about that!\"  He handed him his phone and he immediately dialed the front desk.  \"And good morning to you as well!  I'd like to order some room service.  Yes, I'd like the deluxe breakfast special, with extra everything and a pitcher of Milk and OJ if you'd be so kind?  Why thank you very much!\"  He immediately hung up the phone and stuffed it into his pocket, whistling a little morning chyme despite the maw's lack of human lips, but Naruto was too preoccupied with previous issues to really care about the physics of talking, walking wolf-people.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back, Hunter noticed the distant look on Naruto's face.  \"Is something on your mind, Naruto?\"  Hesitant, Naruto stopped for a moment, debating if he wanted to bring it up, \"Naruto?  You okay, pal?\"<br>\r\nFinally deciding, Naruto sighed and said, \"Well, actually, I was meaning to ask you about something.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto walked towards the closet and opened it.  Hunter's smile dropped slightly.  \"Oh.\"<br>\r\n\"Look, the whole knocking me out bit was one thing, but breaking into my place?\"<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't steal anything if that's what you're worried about,\" responded Hunter a bit nervously.  <br>\r\n\"It's not that.  I mean, you don't seem like the kinda guy who'd do something like that to someone else, but why'd you break into my place to begin with?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean to be fair, I didn't really...break in per say...\" replied Hunter as he rubbed the back of his head a bit nervously.  \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Yesterday, before my acquaintance knocked you out, I was kinda...watching you, to see when you would be heading out so he could intercept.\"<br>\r\n\"And by intercept, you mean ambush.\"<br>\r\n\"R-right.  Well, when you left your apartment last night, you kinda...forgot to lock the front door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed before Naruto sweat dropped with embarrassment.  \"....Ah.\"<br>\r\n\"But as to WHY I entered your house, well...\" Hunter rubbed the back of his head a bit hesitantly, then continued, \"...I was kinda hoping maybe you'd be interested in a few other feast days too, and figured you'd probably need some additional digs.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I did bust my fly last night, and I REALLY wouldn't have wanted to run back home with my pants falling off to get a new pair,\" said Naruto, blushing a bit at the prevented embarrassing situation that could've been.<br>\r\n\"Still, I'm not exactly comfortable with other people rummaging around my stuff like-oh crap!  If I forgot to lock up, then that means my apartment's still unlocked, I gotta-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Hunter waved Naruto's panic aside and said, \"Don't worry, I made sure to lock up after I gathered what you needed.\"  Naruto stopped for a moment, then glanced sternly at Hunter.  \"...And how did you manage to do that?\"  Hunter looked away, a bit embarrassed for Naruto, before reaching into his bag and pulling out Naruto's keys.  \"You left them on the counter.\"  He said, handing them to a humiliated Naruto.<br>\r\n\"...Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked then playfully nudged Naruto in the arm, \"Ah don't sweat it.  Happens to the best of us,\" said Hunter, knowing full well neither he, nor anyone he knew, would ever do something that absent minded.  \"Well, thanks for locking up.  I guess I owe you one there.  Still, I WAS pretty hungry...\" remembered Naruto.  And as if on cue, a knocking came at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly, Hunter opened up and greeted the hotel busboy with his payment and tip while he wheeled in a massive cart of food.  Pulling the cart towards the room's table, Hunter licked his maw hungrily and said, \"Well now that we've got all that settled, I say we dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked back.  More than ready to cram as much food into his gullet as he could.  </span></div></div>",

Sitting at the table, he lifted the top off, revealing a huge stack of pancakes, at least half a dozen, topped with butter and drenched in syrup. Grinning widely, Naruto moved the platter in front of him and grabbed the fork and knife that had been provided, cutting into the fluffy pancakes. Hunter, likewise, grabbed an equally large platter and opted to sit across from Naruto. He lifted the top off, practically salivating at the veritable mountain of bacon that awaited him. Licking his chops, he set it moved the platter front of him and grabbed two big pawfuls of bacon, taking a bite out of one at the same time Naruto took his first bite of pancake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth their eyes lit up as their mouths were assailed with wonderful tastes;Naruto's with sweet fluffyness, and Hunter's with greasy, savory saltiness. Licking their lips, they continued attacking their first courses. They continued on in this manner for a minute or two; Naruto cutting off huge pieces of his pancakes and shoving thm in his mouth, Hunter taking huge bites of his bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Naruto broke the silence. \"Say, Hunter, I've been meaning to ask,\" he spoke up through a mouthful of pancake. \"What's the deal with that phone of yours?\" He swallowed. \"I mean, I've seen phones before, but a lot of 'em are big and bulky and have a cord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chomped off another mouthful and gulped it down, smiling. \"Ah, yeah, that.\" He got up to grab a couple glasses, along with the pitchers of milk and orange juice, from the cart, plopping the pitchers in the center of the table and giving Naruto a glass, keeping one for himself. \"Well, see, the thing is, I'm from somewhere where we've got crazy-advanced tech.\" He reached across the table and grabbed the pitcher of OJ, pouring himself a glass and taking a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Naruto replied, pouring himself a glass of milk. \"Never heard about that in any of the villages we were told about...\" He grabbed the glass of milk and lifted it to his lips. Hunter, smirking, watched as he tilted it back, waiting until the milk was flowing down his throat to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's 'cause I'm not from this world at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto spluttered, spraying the milk in front of him (but somehow missing the platter.) \"Wh-what?!\" Naruto exclaimed, grabbing a napkin and wiping his mouth. \"You some sort of alien or something?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Hunter took another bite of his bacon. \"No, no, nothing like that; I'm Earth born and raised...\" He smirked again. \"Just not this Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScowling, Naruto cut himself a few more bites. \"You're not making any sense! Where are you from?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter licked his chops. \"Well, since you asked so nicely...\" Hunter ripped off another mouthful of bacon and gulped it down. \"See, the thing is...I'm from another dimension entirely.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, the fork halfway to his mouth, stopped and gaped. \"Wh-what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed. \"Yessir. Of course, I don't do it myself; I have friends and acquaintances who help me travel from place to place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, staring, took another sip of milk. \"So, when you said you traveled a lot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded. \"Yep; I travel a lot in my own world, too, but I still go to a lot of different worlds, see the sights, meet the folks there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded back. \"So, your dimension...do wolf-people live there instead of humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf laughed. \"Nah, there's plenty of humans; they're the ones who live in the cities. The 'wolf-people' like myself, as you so eloquently put it, tend to live in the woods, outta sight of prying eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tilted his head. \"But if you were living outta sight, then why...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...did I start exploring different places?\" Hunter finished; the young ninja nodded. \"Well, there's a fun story behind that, and it starts with probably the most amazing smell you can imagine...but I'll save that for another time.\" He crammed more bacon in his maw, grinning cheekily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scowled, feeling gipped. \"Oh, whatever,\" he mumbled, cramming more forkfuls of pancake into his mouth. \"Well, if you're not gonna tell me about that, why don't you tell me about some of the guys on your phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pictures?\" Hunter replied, gulping down the rest of his glass of OJ and reaching over to refill it. \"Oh, those are the pictures I took of the friends, acquaintances, and, er...enemies I've made along the way.\" He reached into his pocket, pulling his phone out. Fiddling around with it some, he gave a satisfied \"ah!\" and held it up for Naruto to see. The photo depicted Hunter grinning and making a peace sign; beside him, a young, spiky-haired man with pinkish hair wearing long white pants, sandals, and an overcoat without a shirt was grinning and giving  at thumbs-up. Beside the man, what appeared to be a blue cat with white, feathered wings was hovering about and grinning at the camera. \"See here? Believe it or not, this guy, Natsu Dragneel, is a wizard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. \"Wizard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded. \"Yep; a Dragon Slayer, to be precise. And this...\" he pointed to the cat. \"Is Happy, Natsu's best friend.\" He chuckled. \"They're kinda insane...actually, their entire guild is...but they're alright guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, curious, opened his mouth to say something, but his stomach suddenly growled, suddenly reminding him that he was still quite famished. \"Tell ya what: you can show more more pictures after we eat.\" He promptly cut off a huge hunk of pancake and crammed it into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded as his stomach growled as well. \"Agreed; there are a lotta pics anyway, and everything'll be cold if we screw around too much.\" With that, he resumed tucking into his bacon.</span></div></div>",

Satisfied, Naruto leaned back and patted his stomach happily and said, \"Mmmm-mmm!  Those were some of the fluffiest pancakes I've had in ages!\"  Smiling, Hunter nodded, still licking his maw and enjoying the crispy flavor of bacon on his tongue.  \"Told you this place was great.  Now, what next?\" Hunter asked himself as he examined the many platters to choose from.  As if in unison, both his and Naruto's eyes locked on a giant platter shining brighter than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" they both muttered at the same time.  Naruto grabbed the surprisingly heavy platter and placed it at the center of the table.  Lifting the top off, both their eyes widened with awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDozens upon dozens of thick, soft waffles, accompanied by an immense amount of sausage, fruits, and various syrup cups.  The heavenly aroma wafting from this particular tray was enough to carry the boy and the wolf by the noses as they each smiled, mouths watering at the sheer sight of it all.  \"Well...that's certainly new...\" said Hunter to himself.  <br>\r\n\"Look at it all...I don't think even I could eat all that by myself...\" said Naruto, still mesmerized.  \"Wanna go half and half?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding eagerly, the two licked their lips/maw as they helped themselves to several waffles, and topped them with syrup and an occasional side of sausage.  Finally, they each cut off a piece and, again, in unison, took that wonderful first bite.  The buttery sweet and moist taste was like a tidal wave of flavor crashing down upon their tongues in one fell swoop.  Almost immediately after, the two began to quickly cut off more pieces and stuff them into their mouths.  \"I can't believe I'm saying this, but in all the dimensions I've traveled, and of all the waffles I've sampled, these bad boys take the cake!\" said Hunter between mouthfuls, enjoying each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's attention turned to Hunter, intrigued.  Gulping down a hearty amount of waffle, Naruto sighed happily and as he cut up another piece, and said, \"Speaking of which, what kinda stuff is there is to eat in other dimensions?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?  Oh, well, a lot of them, believe it or not, have pretty similar meals to what you'd find anywhere in Konoha.  But others...?\"  he swallowed a mouthful and continued, \"...Can be a bit more...exotic.\"<br>\r\n\"Exotic?\"<br>\r\n\"Some dimensions have entirely new species of animal, fruit, vegetable, and a lot actually taste pretty great!  Some?  Less than others.  Plasmaberry smoothies aren't drinks I'll be having anytime soon...took me almost a week to shed off the feathers...\"<br>\r\n\"...The wha-?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, yeah.  One thing I love about this dimension is your food doesn't come with any weird science-y side effects.  Can't say the same about other dimensions...\" said Hunter with a shudder as he resumed eating more and more waffles.<br>\r\n\"How's this for exotic?\" said Naruto with a grin as he wrapped a piece of sausage around a piece of waffle and took a big hearty bite.  \"Mmmm!  T-that's actually not half bad!\" said Naruto with surprise in his voice as he continued to consume his waffles with other various additions, such as strawberry and banana slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more, the two continued to rip their waffles apart, drench them in syrup and stuff them into their mouths.  As time went on, their stomachs began to slowly show the true extent of the amount of waffles and sausage consumed, creating the slightest of curves in their stomachs from the intake...</span></div></div>",

Their stomachs had curved outwards a good deal more, and were starting to make an impression on their respective shirts; the flame symbol on Naruto's shirt, in particular, was starting to appear pushed-out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" Naruto breathed, licking his lips. \"Haven't had a breakfast that good in ages...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter burped, smiling and wagging his tail. \"Hey, don't talk like that; we're not anywhere near done!\" He scratched his still-concealed belly, causing one his legs to kick slightly under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling a little bit, Naruto replied, \"Yeah, true...but this is still some of the best grub I've had in a while.\" He looked and grinned at the half of the platter still remaining, then at the cart, still creaking under the weight of the platters upon it. \"And to think; we've barely gotten started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed, scratching the back of his furry head. \"Yeah, its something, ain't it?\" His expression suddenly turned nervous. \"Still, it would be a shame to keep all this to ourselves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Naruto's brow furrowed. \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf laughed nervously. \"Well, see, I kinda sent an, um, anonymous invitation to, er, someone from your village...he should be getting here right about now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes narrowed. \"Someone from the village? Who did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a knocking sounded from the door, followed by a loud, rough voice. \"Oi! Anyone in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened. \"Wait; is that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, Hunter nodded. \"Y-yeah. Say, why don't you go answer the door? He might freak if he sees me first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groaned. \"Fine, fine...\" Grunting, he scooted his chair out and walked over to the door, grumbling all the while. He sullenly opened the door, revealing a brown and spiky-haired teenage boy with slit eyes and red markings down the side of his face. He was wearing a gray, short-sleeved shirt and dark-black/blue shortss. Beside him, a massive dog stood, whining in surprise at the sight of Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's eyes widened. \"Wha-Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kiba,\" Naruto grumbled. \"Hey, Akamaru.\" At his name being called, Akamaru looked up and wagged his tail a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba took a step back, blinking. \"Wha-how-what the hell are you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story,\" Naruto mumbled. \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScowling a bit at Naruto's recalcitrance, Kiba folded his arms. \"Well, it was late last night; me 'n Akamaru had just gotten back from a really, really exhausting mission, and I felt like I could eat a horse. When I went to get myself somethin', I saw a note on the table; it gave me the address of this inn, and it said 'Hungry? Come to this address ASAP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you just took it at its word?\" Naruto asked, incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shrugged. \"Hey, it was free food, and besides...\" He knelt beside Akamaru and gave the dog an affectionate ruffle on top of his head. \"...as long as I've got Akamaru with me, there's nothin' I can't handle!\" Akamaru barked and licked Kiba's face, eliciting a laugh from the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up, the Inuzuka returned to the subject at hand. \"So, about this free food... where is it?\" Smirking, he prodded Naruto's slightly-curved belly, eliciting a blush from the boy. \"It's probably somewhere close, if you're any indication.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back and covering his stomach with his arms, Naruto stammered out an answer. \"Y-yeah, it's in here, but before ya come in, there's something ya gotta know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba raised an eyebrow. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took a breath. \"Well...\" He leaned in close to Kiba's ear and whispered something into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's eyes widened. \"Seriously?\" He barged into the room, muscling past Naruto, Akamaru close behind. \"The guy who got all this food is seriously a....\" He trailed off as he came into the room and saw the other individual seated at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on his cheeriest smile, Hunter raised a paw in greeting. \"Hey, Kiba. My name's Hunter; how's it goin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Akamaru stood, gaping at the strange creature at the table. After a few tense moments, Kiba spoke for both himself and his partner:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. The. Hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne lengthy explanation later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that's how we got here,\" Hunter finished, addressing Kiba, now seated at the table alongside him and Naruto. Akamaru was lying on the floor beside Kiba's chair, looking at Hunter as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Akamaru shared a look before the former turned his attention back towards Hunter. \"So...lemme get this straight,\" Kiba began. \"You kidnapped Naruto, took him out to eat, and you both crammed as much food into your guts as you could. Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blushed. \"Y-yeah, that's about the size of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded. \"Alright. And now, you're gonna spend a few days doing the same thing, and you invited me to be a part of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined. <i>Oh man, I don't like where this going...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled. \"Relax, Akamaru; everything's gonna be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba frowned at Hunter. \"Hey, bug off, Akamaru's just...\" He stopped as something occured to him. \"Wait...how did you just understand him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a wolf, remember?\" Hunter replied, smirking. \"Kinda comes with the territory...\"' He scratched the back of his head. \"So...you in or out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Akamaru exchanged another look. They looked back at Hunter, then back at each other again. Finally, Kiba looked directly at Hunter and said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only if you let Akamaru in on it too!\"  Hunter smiled and immediately said, \"Of course!  The more the merrier, right?  Besides,\" he turned to Akamaru's way and grinned as he followed up with, \"I was starting to feel a little outnumbered by all the humans here.  It'll be nice to eat with my own kind.\"  Akamaru chuckled and wagged his tail, <i>Well, if you insist....</i> Akamaru thought as he stood beside Kiba, who once again ruffled the dog's fuzzy head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned curiously to Hunter and said, \"Y-you really don't mind paying for all <i>four</i> of us?  I mean this guy may not be able to put away as much as I can, but he can still put a dent in your wallet.\"  Kiba immediately glared at Naruto and sternly said, \"Whadduya mean I can't put away more than you?!\"  Akamaru's paw immediately rose to his face as he seemed to be shaking his head.  <i>Ugh, heeeere we go...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, Hunter's ears dropped slightly as he suspected this wasn't going to end well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling smugly, Naruto pointed towards Hunter and said, \"Just last night, the two of us were stuffing more into our guts than I'd ever eaten in my entire life.  Not once have I ever seen you ever even come NEAR wolfing down as much as I did.  Hell, even HE managed to keep up more than you ever do!\"  Kiba's attention turned to Hunter, \"Who?  This skinny wolf guy?!\"  Hunter, caught off guard, looked stunned as he fumbled at the sudden spotlight, \"H-hey, how'd I get dragged into this?  I'm just-\"<br>\r\n\"Just what?  Someone who thinks he can eat more than I can?!\"<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't say-\"<br>\r\n\"You bet your ass he can!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was dumbfounded.  On one hand, he was flattered that Naruto was complementing him, which made his tail wag a bit, much to Akamaru's amusement, but on the other hand, Kiba was certainly a bit more competitive than he thought he was prepared for.  \"That's it, break time's over, you wimps!  Let's do this!\" said Kiba as he sat himself right on down at the table between the ninja and wolf.  His attention immediately focused on the massive platter of waffles.  \"Oi!  Who was eating what around here?\" said Kiba.<br>\r\n\"Oh, we were just sharing this platter and stopped for a little breather, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hunter could finish his statement, Kiba grabbed the platter and immediately began rapidly wolfing down the waffles by himself, much to Hunter and Naruto's surprise.  \"Yeah right, like he's gonna eat that whole thing by himself,\" scoffed Naruto as he took a gulp of milk.  Hunter, however, was bewildered at the sight.  More and more, Kiba stuffed several pieces of waffle into his mouth, gulping it down and just kept on going like a hot headed eating machine.  Between bites, he turned to the two and said, \"You guys think you can eat more than me?  I'll show you how it's done!\"  Gulping down another hearty mouthful, he helped himself almost angrily to some sausage, poured some syrup onto a few waffles and immediately went to town while everyone just watched.  \"Again, I-I didn't say anyth-\"<br>\r\n<i>Don't bother.  Trust me, he's loooooong gone,</i> thought Akamaru, until his stomach growled, <i>Oh, and while you're at it, could you pass a platter my way?</i>  Still focused on Kiba's eating prowess, Hunter grabbed a tray of bacon and placed it down for Akamaru to immediately start scarfing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more time went on and Kiba was still eating at the same machine-like pace.  Slowly, his stomach began to distend slightly beneath his shirt, not so much as deterring him in the slightest.  Hunter was impressed, but Naruto paid no real heed.   \"Is he always this intense?\" asked Hunter.<br>\r\n\"Ah don't worry, he's just trying to prove a point.  Just you watch, in a few minutes, he's gonna start feeling it,\" responded Naruto, still confident that Kiba wouldn't be able to eat the second half of the waffle platter by himself, whereas Naruto and Hunter had to share to get half way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on, Kiba's gut began to grow slightly nearer to the same size and Naruto's and Hunter's, and more and more, Kiba began to slow down...</span></div></div>",

Akamaru, even as he scarfed down his bacon, looked at him out the side of his eyes, giving a small, worried whimper. Hunter grinned, practically rubbing his paws together in delight, while Naruto watched, impressed despite himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grunted and crammed forkful after forkful of light, fluffy waffles and syrup into his maw, ignoring the discomfort in his abdomen. With every forkful, his stomach bulged out a little bit under his shirt, making more and more of an impression with every several bites that went down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Hunter, and Akamaru watched, marveling, as the waffles slowly disappeared from the platter, Kiba's stomach distending and bulging in reverse proportion. Kiba winced again, and slowed noticeably, but he never once let up, and maintained a steady rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kiba let his fork and knife clatter to the empty plate, flopping back in his chair. \"Oh...oh man,\" he groaned bringing a hand up to his distended tummy and gently massaging it through the shirt. \"That...that was really something...\" Suddenly, his eyes flew wide open, and he let loose with a considerable belch. He sighed, smiling. \"Ahhh....that's better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned. \"Woo!\" he whooped, pumping a paw in the air. \"Way to go, Kiba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. \"...whoa,\" he finally said, staring at the picked-clean platter. \"Didn't actually expect ya to make it all the way. Not bad, Kiba.\" The other boy, hearing this, ceased in his ministrations and looked at the blonde, smirking cockily. This quickly faded when he added, \"Of course, ya still don't hold a candle to me or Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop dragging me into this...\" Hunter muttered, ears drooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scowled at Naruto, not hearing Hunter's complaint. \"Oh please, Uzumaki! If you honestly think either of you can hold a candle to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think?!\" Naruto exclaimed. \"Hey, Hunter and I stuffed ourselves like crazy last night, and it took us a while to slow down, unlike you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, I didn't have time to prep!\" Kiba protested, lightly slugging Naruto in the shoulder. \"Besides, you didn't win all of our eating contests, in case you've forgotten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I didn't, that's for sure,</i> Akamaru whined. <i>Wasn't any fun explaining to your mom why you looked pregnant...</i> Huntetr, hearing this, chuckled, even as his tail wagged giddily at the implications of Akamaru's statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grit his teeth. \"I-I was off my game those times! Besides, even if you <i>did</i> win some, your gut never got as big as either of ours got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned cheekily. \"How would you know? The times I won, you were too sick to even see straight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scowled. \"Same for you, dog-breath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter got out of his seat and raised his paws in the air. \"Easy, easy fellas; calm down.\" Both boys stopped and glared at Hunter. Shrinking back a bit, he nonetheless continued. \"Look, it's obvious you can both put it away, especially when you're competing, but this is supposed to be fun for all of us. Now, I'll admit its fun watching you two bicker...\" Naruto and Kiba's faces grew confused, while Akamaru just wagged his tail, amused despite himself at the sentiment. \"...but try to tone it down a bit, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba glared at each other for a few moments before, finally, they looked away. \"Okay, whatever...\" Naruto muttered, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fine,\" Kiba mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter clasped his paws together. \"Excellent! Now that that's taken care of, there's still plenty of food left; help yourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding no second bidding, Naruto and Kiba sprang to their feet, bolting over to the cart and retrieving two more platters, the latter with a bit of sniffing. As he prepared to return to the table, something occurred to him, and he grabbed another plate, struggling to hold it with one hand. Bending down, he set it in front of Akamaru, whose tail started wagging at the delectable scents emanating from it. Laughing, Kiba took the top off, revealing a truly titanic pile of sausages. The sight of this caused Akamaru's mouth to open, panting in anticipation. Chuckling at his buddy's excitement, Kiba stood back up and lugged his platter over to the table. Sitting down at about the same time Naruto did with his platter, they both took the lids straight off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes lit up at the sight of the meals upon their plates. Naruto's was a massive mountain of french toast, several cups of syrup on the side. Beside them, several well-toasted bagels sat, little dishes of butter nearby and ready for use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, on the other hand, had chosen a plate piled high with protein. A huge mound of scrambled eggs sat upon it, with equally-large piles of breakfast meats-sausages, bacon, and the like-beside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling at their reactions, Hunter took the opportunity to get a plate for himself-this one containing a large breakfast sandwich, several large slices of french toast, and a side of fruit-and sat down, picking up an apple and waiting for the show to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to wait long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping themselves out of their shocked trances, Naruto and Kiba looked at each other, smirked, then dove into their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This,</i> Hunter thought, taking a bite out of the apple, <i>is gonna be good...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, even as he attacked both his new plate and his remaining bacon, shuddered. <i>I've got a bad feeling about this...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Hunter watched both Naruto and Kiba gorge themselves on their plates, his own stomach rumbled audibly, reminding him that he was still quite hungry himself.  Placing his apple down, he thought to himself for a moment, \"Hey, Naruto's the one who kept saying what a big eater I was.  Wouldn't want to make a liar of him, right?  Besides, look at how much Kiba ate in one go.  And all because Naruto said we could eat more than him.  Guess Naruto's not the only one whose competitive nature gets the better of them...\"  And so, Hunter also began to tear into his meal, still focusing as best he could on the young ninja's dining beside him, in the hopes that, despite his trying to keep the peace, that the two would continue not letting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued to dip entire pieces of french toast into the syrup and stuff it directly into his mouth shortly after, before chewing heartily while prepping another piece.  Gulping it all down in one go, Naruto sighed with satisfaction, and took a big shark-like bite out of his next piece, enjoying the buttery sweet flavor.  Meanwhile, Kiba just continued to scarf down one fork full of scrambled eggs into his mouth after another.  Occasionally, he'd stop and start scarfing down big chunks of sausage mixed with bacon.  Even Akamaru had let his hunger get the better of him as he greedily scarfed down his breakfast sausages like ordinary dog food.  Truly, it was food bliss all around for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a huge wolf-like bite out of his extra large sandwich, Hunter paused, catching his breath as he rested one paw against his stomach happily, feeling it's gradual increase with the more consumed.  As he did though, he examined the others to see how progress was going. Naruto's belly had begun to balloon outward, much like it started to last night.  Kiba's in so short a time, had already ballooned outward, almost surpassing Naruto, while he continued to eat more.  Even Akamaru's sides began to distend as more and more sausage entered his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Hunter rested one hand atop his own belly, feeling how much smaller it was than everyone else's in comparison, and began to wolf down his meal at a faster rate while stuffing more and more slices of french toast into his maw at once before he moved back onto his sandwich.  All the while they were putting their meals away, in almost four-way unison, all their bellies were growing and distending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finishing up his sandwich, Hunter leaned back against his chair, rubbing his distended belly with one hand while the other grabbed his cup of OJ.  As Hunter gulped it down, he began to notice Naruto was starting to eat things at a faster and more rapid pace than Kiba, who was now beginning to stagger a bit behind the blond.  He also noticed that his own stomach was currently exceeding Kiba's, much to his surprise.  \"Hehe, perfect,\" thought Hunter as Kiba stopped eating for a moment to catch his breathe and massage his wary tummy,  \"Losing to Naruto may be one thing, but if he sees he's not even eating more than I am, then maybe he'll pick up the pace.  But how to get his attention...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's thoughts were interrupted by a loud belch erupting from Kiba's mouth.  Kiba sighed and smacked his lips as he finished making some more room in his gut.  In that instant, Hunter grinned to himself as watching this gave him an idea to subtly get Kiba's attention.  He pressed one paw firmly into his own belly, forcing out an even louder and surprisingly lengthier belch than Kiba's to get both his and Naruto's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, NICE one, Hunter!\" cheered an impressed Naruto.  Hunter smiled as he sighed with relief.  \"Ahhh, thanks.  Just makin' a lil extra room,\" he said as he patted his distended belly proudly in satisfaction and more importantly, for emphasis.  And sure enough, Kiba had noticed that Hunter's stomach had indeed exceeded his own, immediately firing him up, just as Hunter had intended and hoped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Hunter DIDN'T expect however, was what happened promptly after that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba gaped at Hunter's gut; though it still remained underneath his tank top, it had ballooned outwards noticeably, and it appeared as though he were hiding a large ball of some sort underneath it. With some disgruntlement, the young dog-nin looked down at his own belly; though it had also ballooned considerably and also formed a distinct spherical shape underneath his gray t-shirt, it was still noticeably smaller than Hunter's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling, he looked over at Naruto, who was leaning back in his chair and gulping down a glass of milk, his unoccupied hand massaging his belly. Though it was still fully concealed, just as Hunter and Naruto's were, it was actually slightly (but still noticeably) bigger than Hunter's belly, and the flame symbol on the front was being pushed out and distorted even more than it had been before. Scowling, Kiba looked back at his own belly, prodding it a bit with a finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes suddenly widened, and a sly smirk formed on his face. \"Say, Naruto, Hunter...\" he began, looking back up. \"Ya both looked like you were doin' real good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped down the last of his milk and turned towards Kiba. \"Heh, damn right!\" He gave his gut a hearty smack, releasing a sudden burp. Naruto blushed, but nonetheless giggled childishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter tilted his head and frowned; unlike Naruto, he had caught the tone in Kiba's voice. \"Um...yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't the only one who'd caught Kiba's tone. Akamaru-his sides now noticeably distended-paused in his scarfing of his sausages and looked up at Kiba, whimpering. <i>Kiba...what do you have planned?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba only smirked in response. \"Trust me, Akamaru, this is gonna be fun,\" he assured the dog without looking at him. His smirk became a full-blown grin as he looked at Hunter and Naruto. \"Well then...\" A gleam formed in his eyes. \"...you guys wanna have an eating contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, who had been mid-sip on a glass of OJ, sprayed it out (thankfully having the foresight to turn to the side before he did so. He coughed a bit, wiping his muzzle with a napkin. \"Um...did you say eating contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded. \"Yep! We all eat as much as we can, and whoever can go the longest without giving up wins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned, turning his head towards Kiba while rubbing his belly through his shirt. \"Heh, you're on, Kiba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter raised his paws up. \"N-now hold on...\" he began, before a thought occurred to him: he'd been trying to get Kiba to pick up his pace by appealing to his competitive nature, and it seemed to have worked extremely well. What was more, seeing as how he'd actively declared a challenge, no doubt he'd be doing his damnedest to eat as long and fast as he could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's frazzled expression slowly resolved into a smile. <i>Hmm...this could...actually be quite epic.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, he bowed his head. \"I'd be happy to accept your challenge, good sir, on the condition you both give it your all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba raised an eyebrow at Hunter's choice of words. \"Um, OK...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, on the other hand, was slightly more used to Hunter's behavior by now, and grinned. \"You're damn right we'll do our best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned back. \"Attaboy, Naruto! Now,\" He scooted back and got to his feet, trying to maintain his center of gravity as he did so, \"help me grab as many of these plates as ya can and bring 'em over to the table!\" He moved as quickly as his growing gut would allow him, grabbing two large platters and bringing them back to the table, even as he staggered under their weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kiba and Naruto got to their feet and grabbed two more platters each, staggering back to the table and setting them down as Hunter had. The three then repeated the process, bringing platter after platter to the table, until the cart was all but depleted, and the table was practically creaking under the weight of all the platters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done with, Naruto, Kiba, and Hunter set to work taking the covers off the plates, taking deep whiffs as they did so, salivating slightly(Kiba and Hunter even panted a bit, owing to their sense of smell), accomplishing the work in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, they all took their seats, and stared at the feast before them. Arrayed on the table was the biggest selection of breakfast food they'd ever seen: pancakes stacked half a dozen to a dozen high, french toast made from whole loaves of bread, gigantic waffles(some of which were slathered in ice cream, and others in syrup), sausages, sausage patties, bacon, eggs prepared in every way imaginable, mountains of muffins, piles of bagels, stacks of buttery toast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them simply sat where they were, alternatively gaping at the platters and taking deep whiffs of the delectable aromas that assailed their nostrils. Even Akamaru looked up from his sausages, his tail wagging and his tongue lolling out. <i>Oh man...those look and smell so good...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for him, Kiba had heard him even through his trance, and dazedly grabbed a few platters and set them in front of Akamaru. Tail wagging in delight, Akamaru licked Kiba's hand. The dog-nin smiled, but did not tear his sight away from the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three continued gaping at the spread, before someone broke the silence. And, predictably, that someone was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough staring!\" Naruto grabbed a fork and knife. \"Let's eat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Hunter needed no second bidding; grabbing their own utensils, the licked their lips, grinned, and, in near-perfect synchrony with Naruto, dove into the spread, starting with whatever was nearest to them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Within mere moments of starting, all three were face deep into a pile of various entrees.  This time, Naruto was plowing throw a massive pile of waffles, mentally hoping to tear them down quicker than Kiba had previously.  Kiba, on the other hand; being the meat lover that he was, ravenously tore into a massive pile of sausages and assorted eggs, while Hunter worked on a massive stack of pancakes lathered in syrup and butter, with a side; albeit <i>big</i> side of French Toast.  All three ate at a rapidly unison pace, with no one showing any signs of slowing down any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru looked up uneasily at the trio while he continued to scarf down one of the platters of sausages Kiba had left for him.  <i>They're gonna have such bad stomachaches by the time this is finis-wow, for hotel food, this stuff is really good!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he just resumed eating, too distracted with his own plate to worry about Kiba or the others.  Hunter observed the two boys whilst he hungrily tore into his fluffy sweet breakfast stack.  As the two continued to inhale their meals, slowly, both their stomachs continued to distend and push outward with neither one showing any signs of giving the other the satisfaction of their defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth occasionally glanced at the others progress while continuously and competitively resuming their feast.  Seems he'd managed to get the ball rolling quite nicely.  But then, another thought occurred to him.  Competition seemed to not only push Kiba into an eating frenzy, but as last night had proven, it got Naruto eating nice and proper as well.  And with two ridiculously competitive heads duking it out like this, what better way to push them further than to give them a very real run for their money?  Competing with each other would only take them so far, but if they're competing and still losing to someone else, who knows how far they'll go?  Hunter intended to find out, and so he began to pick up the pace a considerable amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began cutting bigger pieces of pancake, and scarfing down quite a few at a time instead of his usual amount.  Like a machine, Hunter wolfed down the stack as it gradually began to shrink more and more.  And little by little, his belly continued to distend at a slightly quicker rate than the other boys, to the point where his tanktop began to rise just ever so slightly at the bottom.  More and more, he continued to chop and eat away at the once large stack of pancakes, until finally, it was all but licked clean.  Hunter winced, feeling a familiar, uncomfortable tightness in his growing gut, but smirked to himself as he was dead set on taking the lead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, rather than slow down like he usually would, Hunter took a page from Naruto's technique last night and poured himself a full cup of OJ and began to gulp it down as quick as he could without stopping.  Finally depleting the cup, he had to catch his breathe momentarily, before gripping his gut and unleashing a loud and lengthy belch, freeing up as much room in his belly as he could expel.  The loud, disgusting sound startled both Naruto and Kiba as they looked up to see Hunter just closing his mouth as the burp drew to its' end, then sighing with relief as he gave his gut a hearty slap and moved onto his next plate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to both their surprise, Hunter had already completely cleared his first plate, and was now moving onto his second, while both Naruto and Kiba were still working on their first.  Catching this, Hunter looked back at them and smirked slyly as he decided to egg them both on further by saying, \"What's the matter, guys?  You're not having a hard time keeping up, are you?\"  And with that, he began to quickly scarf down the contents of his second plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlabbergasted, Naruto and Kiba stared for a moment, before they immediately shared a glance then began to tear into the remaining contents of their plate faster and more intently to pick up the pace.  Catching this, Hunter glanced back at the two then chuckled in his head.  <i>Haha, I knew this'd be epic...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three were now devouring their meals at a faster and more quantitative pace than before, and in doing so...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hunter had already gotten started on his second platter-a stack of half a dozen waffles with several scoops of vanilla ice cream wedged between each of them-by the time Naruto and Kiba had finished their plates and chosen their own second plates: a huge stack of muffins for Naruto, and a massive plate of cinnamon rolls for Kiba. Gritting their teeth, they grabbed two of their respective treats in each hand and took massive bites out of each of them, not stopping until both were gone, at which point they'd grab two more and repeat the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked as he cut off massive pieces of the waffles and ice cream and crammed them into his mouth, determined not to lose his pace; he was still ahead, but Kiba and Naruto were picking up speed, tearing into their treats with reckless abandon. As all three of them continued to tear into their meals, their bellies resumed growing, though Hunter's still grew noticeably faster than the two boys'. Hunter's stomach continued to push his tank top up to slowly reveal more of the brown, furry belly underneath. Likewise, Naruto and Kiba's shirts had started to rise up as well, though the tiny slivers of flesh they exposed were noticeably less than the strip of brown, furry flesh that Hunter showed. This, of course, only encouraged them to tear into their muffins and cinnamon rolls even faster, expediting the growth of their bellies as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, noticing this, wagged his tail in delight, but still did not slow down, fully willing to keep ahead, if only so the two would try even harder to catch up. As he continued cramming waffle and ice cream into his maw, his stomach continued to swell, and his tank top continued to rise up. His shorts began to feel snug; Hunter winced and shrugged it off, but privately resolved to unbutton them at some point; no sense in busting two pairs of shorts in a row...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to Hunter's inner musings, Naruto and Kiba soldiered on, continuing to tear into their individual treats. Their bellies continued to distend, and their shirts continued to rise up. Looking down at their bellies, they scowled, obviously not satisfied with their progress. To this end, they each found another platter and drew it closer to them, taking the tops off to reveal more finger-food; specifically, bagels for Kiba and toast for Naruto. This done, they changed their tactics a bit, grabbing two of their treats in one hand and two of their treats in the other hand and took even bigger bites out of them simultaneously. The effect was immmediately apparent; their bellies began bulging bigger, faster, their shirts rising higher and higher up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, even as he continued attacking his waffles and ice cream, smirked. <i>That's it, fellas...show me what you got.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto and Kiba continued to rapidly scarf down numerous portions of their entrees at once, which continued to inflate their stomachs further with every heaping mouthful gulped down.  Smirking, Hunter continued to press onward in an effort to egg both on and continue their progression.  Glancing back as he stuffed more bits of waffle and ice cream into his maw, Hunter's tail wagged as he observed both ninja's bellies continuing to grow, lifting the bottom of their shirts up and causing more flesh to expose in the process.  <i>Awesome.  Just gotta keep this up...</i> <br>\r\nHunter thought to himself as he had noticed his lead over the others was beginning to blur due to their newfound tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he decided to follow suit and simply grab a waffle by the paw and chomp on it by hand, taking about half a waffle in a single mouthful.  Gulping it down, he sighed with relief then attempted to stuff the second half into his jaws shortly after.  Upon doing so however, he winced as he felt an immense tightness holding him back.  Letting his free hand reach down to his distended belly, Hunter could feel his stomach had distended to the point where it was beginning to repress beneath his own button and zipper.  <i>Ah shoot, can't let my shorts bust again...</i> Hunter thought, as he lowered the remaining half of his waffle back onto his plate and reached down to try and undo his button.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf way into a bagel, Kiba gulped down a hearty mouthful then glanced back at Hunter who was struggling a bit to get his button undone from under the weight of his own stomach.  Smirking, Kiba wiped his mouth of crumbs and said, \"Awww, what's wrong?  Does the Wolfy have a tummy-ache?\" then proceeded to stuff the rest of his bagel into his mouth.  <i>Jeez, what is it with these two and lame nicknames...?</i> Hunter thought as he rolled his eyes, then finally, after a brief struggle to get a hold of his button from beneath his distended belly, he said, \"Nope, just taking care of something...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he undid his button, and in that instant, his furry brown belly pushed outward considerably by a few inches more as he sighed with relief and stuffed the second half of his waffle into his mouth and gulped it down with gusto.  Kiba's jaw nearly gaped at the sight, \"....Are you kidding me?!\"  Even Akamaru was surprised at the mere extent Hunter had consumed.  <i>And I thought these two overdid it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScoffing, Naruto said, \"Man, how'd you get so much better at this...?\"  To which Hunter shrugged, as he cut a large chunk of waffle and lathered it with ice cream and with a cocky grin, said, \"Maybe you guys are just slowing down a bit?\" then stuffed the vanilla ice cream smothered waffle chunk into his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like clockwork, both Naruto and Kiba immediately picked up the pace, despite the snug fullness both had begun to feel.  Akamaru glanced back at both of them and shook his head.  <i>Just haaaaaaad to push them, didn't you....</i> he thought as he consumed some of his remaining sausage links.  Hunter merely grinned at the dog and shrugged as he finished up the remaining bits of waffle and ice cream, before moving onto his third platter...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hunter, even as he tackled his third platter-holding a massive stack of pancakes and a huge mound of scrambled eggs-grinned as he saw Naruto and Kiba tearing away at their bagels, muffins, and cinnamon rolls even faster than before, only pausing for a quick breath or a quick drink of milk. Their stomachs inflated as they downed the treats, forcing their shirts further up and exposing more skin. By the time they polished off the last of them, a decently-sized strip of flesh was showing for each of them, just short of their navels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot missing a beat, they each sought out another plate, pulling it in front of them. They pulled the tops off each, revealing massive breakfast smoothies for each of them-strawberry for Naruto, banana for Kiba. Ignoring the straws they had been provided, they grabbed the smoothies and tilted them up to their mouths, gulping the thick liquid down, heedless of the smoothie that ran down the sides of their faces and onto their shirts. As they did so, their tummies steadily swelled bigger and bigger as the smoothie entered them, causing their shirts to rise up even further in the process. By the time they'd demolished half their smoothies, their shirts had ridden up to expose their belly buttons. Noticing this with only a downward motion of their eyes, Naruto and Kiba continued guzzling their smoothies, inflating their stomachs further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's tail wagged wildly, even as he forked a massive helping of eggs into his mouth. <i>Thaaat's it...keep it up...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, finishing up the last of his sausage links, licked his chops and looked up at t he two, whining. <i>Oh man, they're really getting into it now...their guts are gonna be huge by the time they're done everything...</i> Suddenly, his own stomach gurgled, causing him to look at it and notice he wasn't much better off; his own belly was noticeably protruding, sticking out underneath him and bulging out to the sides. His ears drooped. <i>How do I always get sucked into these things?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to Akamaru's musings, all three competing parties continued to stuff their faces, Hunter with his eggs and pancakes, Naruto and Kiba with their gigantic breakfast smoothies. Within a matter of minutes, Naruto and Kiba had depleted their smoothies, plunking the empty glasses on the table. At this point, their stomachs had grown even more, their shirts now situated a good several inches above their belly-buttons. Wiping their mouths with their sleeves, Naruto and Kiba quickly moved to seek out their next platters, but suddenly winced and clutched their bellies. Hunter, gulping down a mouthful of pancake, smirked cheekily at them. \"Whassamatter, boys? Gettin' full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba glared at Hunter. \"Dunno about the idiot, but not even close.\" He reached his hands down to his waist, fumbling around for something. \"Just...gotta...get these shorts...taken care of.\" Naruto bristled at the insult, but nonetheless did the same, struggling to grab something around his waist. Hunter watched, amused, as they continued to fumble around for their pants buttons. Finally, they both got a grip on them, and, in surprising synchrony, pulled them free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys sighed in relief as their bellies surged outwards, no longer confined by their buttons; not quite as much as Hunter's had, but still enough to force their shirts up a good bit further. Panting, they massaged their bellies a bit, but beforre they continued, Hunter spoke up. \"If I may...I may have an idea of how to spice this up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Naruto looked up from rubbing his belly. \"Eh? What didja have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined. <i>I've got a really, REALLY bad feeling about this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter gave Akamaru a reassuring grin, before returning his attention to the blonde. \"Ya remember how ya said the different foods I've eaten throughout different dimensions have weird effects on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, while Kiba just looked confused. \"Different dimensions? What the hell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell ya later,\" Naruto explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving Naruto an appreciative grin, he got up from his seat, belly wobbling as he did so, cradling it to keep it steady. \"Wait right here.\" Staggering over to his duffel, he lifted it up onto the bed and rooted through it, retrieving three vials of a bright green liquid. Nodding, he brought them back to the table, sitting back in his seat and setting them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stard. \"Uh...what are those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned. \"They're a special kinda juice I picked up from one of my travels.\" His tail wagged. \"Once you ingest one of these, your body regresses into an eight-year-old state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba gaped. \"...what?\" Naruto finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked. \"Ah, don't be like that, it only lasts a few hours. Besides, haven't ya ever noticed how much kids can eat? Not to mention, it sorta affects the mind too; we'd still have our memories, but we'd probably have a lot more fun doing this.\" He grinned at the two. So? Whaddaya say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba exchanged a bemused glance, before looking back at Naruto and saying...</span></div></div>",

Kiba paused for a moment, then grabbed one as well, despite an uneasy whining from Akamaru.  Looking down at his buddy, Kiba smiled assuredly and ruffled the top of his head said with a smile, said, \"Oh don't worry, boy.  It's only gonna be for a little bit!  Besides, who hasn't wanted to just relax and be a kid again, right?\"  Smiling back, Hunter nodded and said, \"That's the spirit, guys!  Trust me, it'll be a blast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru glanced back at Kiba then nodded, <i>Well, if only for a few hours, then I suppose there's no harm...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant, the three competitors clanked their vials together in a toast-like fashion, and in unison, all three downed their vials to the last drop.  Scowling from the taste, Naruto coughed a bit, \"Ack!  Man, why didn't you warn us how sour those things were?\" hacked Naruto.<br>\r\n\"Eh, tasted fine to me,\" responded Kiba as he smacked his lips, rather enjoying the tart flavor of whatever it was he had just consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant however, he began to feel a tingling sensation grow over his entire body.  As did Naruto and Hunter.   Within that instant, Akamaru watched, jaw practically gaping as the three began to shrink in their clothing.  Their bodies grew softer, younger, as the boys and wolf almost seemed to retreat within themselves.  Their feet were now dangling off their chairs as their shoes and sandals slipped off as a result of their shrunken state.  By the time it was done, both Naruto and Kiba regained composure, rather dazed, then looked down at themselves, then back at each other, jerking back suddenly from the surprise of being greeted by such young yet familiar faces greeting them.  \"Whoa!  W-we're actually kids again!\" exclaimed Naruto in a seemingly more spritely and youthful voice than before.  They then looked back at Hunter, who looked almost like a brown anthro puppy compared to his usual wolf-state.  The two young boys burst into a fit of giggles at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BAHAHAHAHA!  D'awwwwww, look at you now, little Wolfie?  You're adorable!\" spouted Kiba between his hysterical laughter.  Hunter rolled his eyes, \"Hardy har har...\" he said as he looked forward, and much to his surprise, found things a bit blurrier than normal.  \"Aw crud...I forgot, my glasses don't fit anymore,\" complained Hunter as he hoisted himself from what looked like a booster seat this point and reached into his bag.  \"Don't worry, guys.  I have a few extra pairs of clothing here for just a sitch like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Naruto and Kiba looked at each other confused, \"Sitch?\" Kiba asked.  \"Eh, probably a dimensional thing or something,\" replied Naruto as his feet kicked back and forth from the seat of his table.  Putting on a smaller pair of glasses, Hunter grabbed three separate pairs of clothing, and tossed a pair for Naruto and Kiba each.  Their softer more pudgy bellies had all shrunken a considerable amount along with their new younger bodies, but had still distended rather noticeably for all three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the three had changed into more suitable but vaguely familiar attire, Hunter rubbed his paws together and asked in a much more youthful yet still just as energetic as his older self tone, \"So, how's it feel?\"<br>\r\n\"Kinda cool!  I feel all jumpy now!\" said Naruto as he hopped around all excited and eager-like.  \"Anyone wanna fight or something?\"  Kiba and Akamaru shared a glance then sighed.  \"Still the same moron....\" Kiba muttered under his breath, much to Akamaru's amusement, before he licked Kiba's face, causing the boy to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So how do you feel, little fella?</i>  Kiba shrugged and said, \"Definitely way more energetic, and I wouldn't mind clobbering Naruto in a bit of sparring right now either,\" responded Kiba with a grin as he turned Hunter and asked,  \"How about you, wolf-boy?  How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter scowled a bit less subtly than he usually would at nicknames he didn't like, then after a scoff, opened his mouth to respond, when suddenly a loud rumbling filled the room.  Hunter rubbed the back of his head sheepishly and chuckled with embarrassment as the source was in fact, his distended but shockingly hungry brown tummy.  With a childish grin, finally he answered, \"Hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, both Naruto and Kiba's stomachs also emitted hungry growls, causing the boys to also blush and smirk with a bit of embarrassment as they all remembered why they had agreed to this 'little' venture to begin with.  \"Whadduya say, boys?  Ready to chow down?\" asked Hunter eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Naruto and Kiba nodded eagerly as all three hopped back onto their chairs, and immediately chow down on whatever they can get a hold of; with their newfound youth allowing them to eat a lot more than before and at a much quicker rate than before as well...</span></div></div>",

So, uh, first off: how long exactly is this gonna last? You said a few hours, but you were kinda vague...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter burped, giggling, before jumping back into his omelet. \"I guess I was, wasn't I? Well, I may have understated it a bit...it's actually more like a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A day?!\" Naruto repeated, eyes widening. \"We'll be stuck like that that long?\" Kiba, hearing this, spluttered a bit, but continued shoveling food into his mouth, glaring at Hunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little pup shrank back a bit. \"Sorry...\" To his surprise, Naruto's face split into a huge grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are ya sorry for? We have a whole day of relaxing and having fun ahead of us! I was just surprised it would be that long.\" Naruto licked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sighed, a relieved smile coming across his face. \"Phew; thought you were angry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angry?\" Naruto replied. \"You kidding? Yesterday was some of the most fun I've had in a while, and I'm havin' lots of fun right now!\" His brow furrowed. \"Speaking of which...about how much did that stuff affect our minds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter gulped down the rest of his current glass of orange juice. \"Well, like I said, we still have our memories, but our attention spans are a good bit shorter, we get excited a lot more easily, we have way more energy, and we have a lot less control over our emotions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised an eyebrow, even as he forked more pancake into his mouth. \"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shifted a bit nervously in his seat. \"Well...if you start to think of some really unpleasant memory or something, don't be surprised if you start tearing up.\" He scratched the back of his head. \"Same if you skin your knee or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh,\" Naruto replied slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grimaced apologetically. \"Sorry about that.\" Instantly, his expression brightened. \"But it works the other way, too. When you're feeling happy, you're <i>really</i> happy, and all the things that are bothering you just seem...unimportant.\" He winked at Naruto. \"In other words, the pros outweigh the cons.\" With that, he returned to his omelet with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled at Hunter, then turned to Kiba. \"Ya hear that, Kiba? This is gonna be...\" His eyes widened as he saw that Kiba was almost done his own platter, and was already drawing another close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes narrowed. \"H-hey, that's not fair! You cheated!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, swallowing his mouthful, smirked. \"Hey, it's your own fault for getting all chatty with Wolfy over there.\" Hunter scowled and pouted a bit at the nickname. Ignoring this, Kiba grinned and smacked his belly, which had distended a bit more, and had started to once again force his shirt-a dark green v-neck with red lining around the neck and a cartoony dog face on the front-up once more. \"I just took advantage of it.\" Laughing cockily, he resumed tearing into his plate of huge breakfast sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouting, Naruto's hand went down to his own distended tummy-still covered by a sleeveless orange hoodie over a short-sleeved blue shirt-and compared it to Kiba's. \"Yeah, enjoy it while you can, dog-breath...\" Naruto muttered, jumping back into his pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Hunter, rubbing his own stomach-peeking out the tiniest bit from under his black sleeveless shirt, emblazoned with a partially-shadowed moon-he licked his maw and jumped back into his omelet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Akamaru watched from near the table with utter awe at the sheer speed these three youngsters tore into their meals, all the while, their tummies continued to distend further and further just ever so slightly with each bit of food stuffed into their hungry maws.  <i>Jeez, at this rate, their bellies'll be even bigger than they are...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba maintained the lead for a good while as he plowed through his breakfast sandwiches, but as time went on, Naruto and Hunter began to gain momentum over Kiba, consuming at a much quicker rate and with more being consumed at a moment to moment basis.  Noticing this sudden change of pace, Kiba began eating at a quicker rate, neglecting the portion sizes the two had switched to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good while of consuming a majority of what was on their platters, both Naruto and Hunter stopped briefly and took a hearty gulp of their cups of Milk and OJ respectively to wash down some of the contents of their meal thus far.  As they finished, the two youths ended up slamming their cups down on the table and both burped loudly in unison, causing the boy and the wolf to giggle childishly.  Even Kiba couldn't help but snicker a little bit as he took a drink from his own cup, but as he did, he noticed both Naruto and Hunter immediately went back to scarfing down their platters.  \"H-hey!  No fair, you distracted me!\" pouted Kiba as he sputtered and resumed eating his sandwiches.  Sticking his tongue out at the boy, Naruto grinned mischievously and said, \"Not our faults.  Me and 'Wolfy' were just taking an advantage,\" and once again, he resumed eating.  \"I have a name, you know...\" replied Hunter, unamused as he continued to work on his omelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on, the tides were starting to even out.  All three looked as though their bellies had bloated outward to about the same length, with all three having a vague sliver of flesh exposed from the bottom of their shirts as they rose up to accommodate their ever growing stomachs.  As more time went on however, it seemed as though Naruto was beginning to eat a little quicker than Kiba and Hunter.  Finally finishing his pancakes, Naruto sighed with relief as he gave his belly a few hearty pats.  Glancing back at Naruto, Hunter's tail wagged immensely as he smiled and said, \"Nice job, Naruto!  Didn't think you'd get ahead of Kiba so quick!\" <br>\r\n\"He's only ahead for now!  J-just you wait and see!\" said Kiba uneasily as he attempted to finish the remaining contents of his platter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, however, had just finished his omelet, causing his shirt to ride up a bit more, exposing more of his bloated furry tummy to the two boys, and only making Kiba more uneasy about losing to the two, which resulted in the dog-nin chowing down even quicker to finish the rest of his platter.  Wasting no time, both Naruto and Hunter moved onto their next platters.  For Naruto, an assortment of hash browns, boiled eggs and tons of bacon.  As for Hunter; a huge plate of breakfast sausage, the aroma strong enough to make the young pup's maw water.  The two immediately dug right in as Kiba finally finished his sandwich and needed to take a quick breather before moving onto his next platter...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Kiba leaned back in his seat, trying to catch his breath, Naruto and Hunter tore into their new platters, Naruto, a fork in each hand, picked up large helpings of boiled eggs and hash  browns, shoveling them into his mouth and chewing happily, occasionally setting the utensils down to cram several slices of bacon into his overstuffed mouth, chewing them messily until he could get his mouth closed, then gulping them down after chewing a bit longer. Because of the sheer quantity he gulped down, his tummy bulged out, slightly but noticeably. Licking, his lips, he picked up his forks and repeated the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, on the other hand, eschewed forks and used his bare paws to shovel sausage after sausage into his waiting maw, cramming in as many as possible before shutting his mouth and chewing, giggling all the while. After a while, he gulped them down, and, like with Naruto, the sheer amount he gulped down at once caused his belly to bulge out slightly, making his shirt rise up and exposing more of his brown-furred flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, seeing the two of them like that, grit his teeth and selected his next platter, a plate of two large omelets. Eager to regain his lead, he eschewed utensils and simply picked them up, ripping huge bites out of it, heedless of the fillings and meats that spilled all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued on like this for a while; Hunter and Naruto cramming their maws before gulping them down, Kiba ripping into his omelets with reckless abandon. As they went, their tummies bulged bigger and bigger, slowly forcing their shirts up higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes time, they had begun to slow down, feeling the fullness in their stomachs. Rather than continue and eat themselves sick, they set their food and utensils down and leaned back in their seats, closing their eyes and massaging their midsections. Each of their stomachs had swollen considerably and forced their shirts up a good way, exposing a decent amount of skin on all three and stopping just short of their belly-buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...\" Naruto moaned. \"This is one of the best breakfasts I've had in a while.\" He opened one eye and sat up a bit. \"I can't remember the last time I had this much fun just stuffing myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sighed and massaged his belly. \"Yeah; it's been a while since I got to really unwind like this.\" He looked at Naruto, grinning. \"I can see why you like doing it so much.\" Akamaru licked the side of Kiba's face, causing him to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter belched, giggling. \"Pretty great, isn't it?\" He indicated all three of them, kicking his feet. \"It's even better when we make ourselves kids again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto licked his lips, scratching the exposed portion of his tummy. \"Heh, you said it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba ruffled Akamaru's hair, giggling as the dog nuzzled him. \"Ain't gonna argue with that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled, and settled back in his chair, relaxing. Soon enough, Naruto and Kiba were doing the same, rubbing their stomachs and relaxing in companionable silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for someone-this time, Hunter- to break the silence. \"Listen, guys, I was thinking: we got a day left being stuck like this, and while stuffing ourselves is fun now, spending a lot of that time sleeping that off seems like a waste. So, whaddaya say we stop eating for now, relax, let these,\" he smacked his furry gut for emphasis, 'digest a bit, then maybe go out and spend a day on the town.\" He beamed at the two, giving them a toothy grin. \"So whaddaya say, boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba looked towards the ceiling, pondering this question. Finally, one of them answered...</span></div></div>",

Outside, we can go play, wrestle, race, do whatever!  Whadduya say, Kiba?\"  Looking back down at Akamaru, he asked, \"Sounds fun to me.  How about it, boy?\"  Akamaru's tail wagged at the idea of time in the park, and going out.  In turn, he licked Kiba's face again, causing the boy to giggle from the ticklish sensation while Hunter and Naruto laughed with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the two kids, one pup and giant dog decided to put a hold on finishing the breakfast platter, leaving all their bags in the inn where it'd be safe, and went on their merry way.  Konoha seemed so much bigger and livelier to their smaller, child-forms as they just took it all in, almost in a bewildered state.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving such a young, childlike innocence not hampered by the mindset of adulthood allowed the three youths to appreciate the little things as they wandered the town.  The birds chirping, how the nice blue sky and white fluffy clouds looked like something out of an old oil painting, things seemed to have more color and vividness to them than usual.  All of which brought a comforting warmth to the three.  It was enough to almost make them forget how full their tummies had gotten since this morning's feasting escapades started.  Resting his arms behind his head in a relaxed state as he walked, Naruto broke the ice and asked, \"So whadduya guys wanna do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna head to the park and play?\" suggested Kiba.  As if on cue, both Hunter and Akamaru's tails wagged in unison, causing the human boys to laugh.  \"I'll do ya one better,\" Hunter started, \"let's all race to the park!\"  Both Naruto and Kiba's faces lit up at the notion.  \"Hey, yeah!  That sounds like fun!\" Naruto gleamed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning a devilishly toothy grin, Hunter clutched his glasses tight to make sure they wouldn't fall off, and immediately sprinted off.  \"Starting right now!\" he shouted slyly in the distance, catching Naruto and Kiba off guard.  \"H-hey!  That's cheating!\"  Pouted Kiba, only to see Naruto had immediately sprinted after the wolf pup, trying to catch up.  Slapping his palm to his face, Kiba glanced back at Akamaru and said, \"Rgh, those lousy-Alright, buddy, let's show these dweebs what fast really means!\"  Akamaru chuckled to himself and immediately, he and Kiba tailed shortly behind the other two, catching up at a surprisingly quick pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the park...</span></div></div>",

Naruto was beside him, looking slightly disgruntled, but this turned into a rather smug expression as Kiba and Akamaru came into sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, slowpokes,\" Hunter piped up, tail wagging. \"What took ya so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, screeching to a stop, scowled at the two. \"Oh ha ha,\" he grumbled. He pointed an accusing finger at Hunter. \"Don't go lookin' so smug; you cheated!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, folding his arms, smirked. \"Cheated? I didn't see him cheat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was running on all fours!\" Kiba retorted, once again pointing at Hunter. \"Besides Akamaru, the rest of us were stuck runnin' on two feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup shrugged. \"Hey, what do you expect? I'm a wolf; running on all fours comes naturally to me.\" He giggled, turning around and beginning to walk into the park, the other three following him. \"Don't go bein' a sore loser; wasn't the whole point of the race just to have fun? I know you two are naturally competitive, but didn't you have fun anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba glanced at each other as they walked, Naruto smirking, Kiba still scowling. \"Well...\" Kiba began, \"I guess it <i>was</i> pretty fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, grinning. \"Yeah, it was fun. Ya know what else is fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Hunter asked, still strolling along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba started. \"Hey, wha---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all he had time to get out before Naruto lunged at him, tackling him to the ground. \"Naruto! What the hell are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned impishly, grabbing Kiba's arms. \"Its called wrestling, dog-breath; learn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the blonde's surprise, the little dog-nin smirked. \"Actually, I already have.\" Before Naruto could utter anything in response, Kiba used the grip Naruto had on his arm to flip them both over. He wrested his arms free from Naruto's grip, pushing down on Naruto's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked. <i>Nice one, Kiba.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked to the side and grinned at the dog. \"Thanks, bo---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Kiba, this brief moment of distraction was all Naruto needed to push Kiba's hands off his chest and send him stumbling off him and to the ground. Getting to his feet, Naruto giggled and stuck his tongue out at Kiba. \"Heh, whatcha gonna do no---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all he had time to get out before a ball of brown fur tackled him, pushing him to the ground. Hunter's arms wrapped around Naruto's armpits, pinning him down. \"Heh; eyes on the ball, Uzumaki; eyes on the ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How about eyes on the dog?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Hunter looked up towards where Akamaru's voice came from. \"Well, I've never heard that o---\" His eyes flew wide open as he saw Kiba and Akamaru, rushing at the both of them. Before he could disentangle himself from Naruto, the boy and his dog collided with the two, bowling them over and causing all over to go rolling along the ground. Even as they came to a stop, they had already devolved into a happy ball of chaos; the kids and pup laughing and crawling over one another and Akamaru, trying to wrestle with the others, and occasionally tickling one another, adding to the cacophony of laughter. Akamaru, not one to be left out, roughhoused with the three, pushing them with his head, batting them with his limbs, and licking their faces, much to their delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went on like this for a good few minutes, roughhousing, wrestling, and generally just having a great time. Eventually, though, they disentangled themselves from one another and sprawled out on the ground, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" Naruto panted, arms splayed out to the sides, \"This is some of the most fun I've had in a long time...\" He looked to the side at Kiba, who was sitting up and reclining against Akamaru. \"This what having friends is like? As a kid, I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, panting, nonetheless grinned back at him. \"Sure is, bonehead; better get used to it.\" Naruto's nose wrinkled slightly at the jab, but he quickly settled back down, lying his head back on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, also spread out on his back, his tongue hanging out the side of his muzzle, giggled. \"Hee hee, nothing like some exercise to get ya goin' after a big meal...\" He rubbed a paw over his tummy for emphasis. It had gone down a great deal, and had even retreated back under his shirt, but it still had a definite round shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it,\" Kiba muttered, patting his own tummy, in much the same state as Hunter's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, instead of saying anything, simply nodded in agreement, massaging his own stomach, which had also retreated within his hoodie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them (plus Akamaru) remained like this for a good while, relaxing, chatting, and massaging their bellies. Soon enough, though, their eight-year old bodies had gotten their second wind, and they immediately jumped back into the fray, and soon enough, they were roughhousing and crawling over each other all over again, laughing, giggling, and generally having the time of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Akamaru, lying beside them and panting wildly, looked over at them and wagged his tail. &lt;i&gt;You guys...you guys have fun?&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what did he say?\" Naruto asked between gasps of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba opened his mouth, but Hunter beat him to it. \"He...he asked us if it was fun.\" Kiba scowled and looked over at Hunter, but he didn't move from his spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Naruto gasped. \"In that case...yeah, it was really fun.\" He grinned like a goof and giggled tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt proved infectious, and it wasn't long before Kiba lost his scowl and began giggling as well. \"Heh, for once, I agree with ya.\" He looked over at Hunter again, but this time with a smirk. \"Especially you, Wolfy; ya can definitely hold your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked over at him and growled playfully. \"Thanks, but my name's Hunter; try to remember.\" Sighing, he placed one hand on his stomach; thanks to all the play-fighting, it had retreated back to its normally-slim state. Glancing over at the other two, he noticed their bellies seemed to be in much the same state. &lt;i&gt;Heh; thank goodness for active metabolisms and hyperactivity.&lt;/i&gt; Hunter giggled at the thought...right before his stomach growled audibly. &lt;i&gt;Oh yeah; guess it's been a while since we ate.&lt;/i&gt; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading his mind, Naruto sat up clutching his stomach. \"Um...anyone hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his own stomach growl, Kiba also sat up, scratching Akamaru's ear as he did so. \"Yeah, kinda.\" He looked up at  the sky. \"Still, considering where the sun's at right now, it's probably about lunchtime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunchtime?\" Hunter echoed, sitting up and stretching. \"Great timing; I was gettin' a little hungry myself.\" He rubbed his flat, furry tummy through his shirt. \"So...any ideas on where ya wanna eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's face promptly lit up. \"Ooh! How about Ichiraku's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba rolled his eyes. \"You always eat that stuff, Naruto.\" He grinned. \"How about some steaks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinked. \"Sounds good, but Naruto and I just had steaks yester-\" He suddenly began sniffing the air, his ears perking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked over at him. \"What is it, Wol---Hunter? You smell something?\" He and Akamaru began sniffing the air as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter closed his eyes, sniffing deeply. \"Yeah...it smells like...\" His eyes flew open and a huge grin spread across his muzzle. \"It smells like pizza!\" Tail wagging wildly, he bolted to his paws and began rushing off. \"C'mon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey!\" Naruto protested, getting to his feet and running after him. \"Slow down!\" He yelped as Akamaru and Kiba, having picked up on the delicious scent as well, blew past him.

Huffing and puffing, Naruto leaned forward, trying to catch his breath, before chuckling albeit horsed, then said, \"Jeez...I...I had no idea you guys...*phew*...liked Pizza so much!\"  Hunter grinned, practically re-energized; despite all their rough housing not too long ago, and said, \"Are you kiddin'?  Pizza's got it all!  Tons of smoky meat, melty cheeses, more meat, sauce, doughy crust, and did I mention the meat?\"  Naruto chuckled, seeing Hunter and Akamaru's tails wagging as he went on and on, until finally, he said, \"Well, what're we standing around here for?  Let's go grab a bite!\"  With that, all four headed inside, and were immediately greeted by the waiter.  \"Welcome!   What can we do for you lil guys today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza!\" Naruto spontaneously blurted out, causing Kiba to facepalm while Hunter snickered a bit.  \"Sorry, uhh what my boneheaded buddy over there MEANT to say was-\"  Kiba stopped, sniffing a particularly strong aroma emanating from the brick-stacked oven in the kitchen.  Catching the scent as well, Hunter licked his lips and asked, \"Whadduya guys got in the oven right now?  It smells amazing!\"  Catching the scent as well, Akamaru barked in agreement.  <i>You can say THAT again, pup!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter smirked and said, \"Oh, that?  That's our specialty; 'The Maestro', we call it.  Picture it, boys.  A deep dish pizza, lathered with the zestiest pasta sauce you've ever tasted.  Layered with mozzarella, cheddar, melted to gooey perfection.  Then, take smoked sausages, crispy pepperoni, garlic chicken, and smother it into the cheese with onions, fresh bell peppers, and-oh, did I mention the crust was also stuffed with cheese as well?\"  By the time the waiter was done describing the pizza to the three youths and big dog, all four of their mouths were watering as they simply stood in awe at what could arguably be considered the perfect pizza to all of them.  \"That...sounds....amazing....\" muttered Naruto, still in a dazed state.  \"C-can we get four of those, please?\"  The waiter laughed and shook his head, \"Whoa there, boys.  The Maestro may be a delicate piece of art, but she's not a piece to be taken lightly.  See, in order to get everything layered and proportioned to perfection, she only comes in one size; Extra Extra EXTRA large.  We're talking thirty two immense slices of pizza heaven waiting to melt in your mouth and redefine your notions of taste.  No one man; let alone a boy, a puppy boy...or big dog, could ever tame such a canvas single handedly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shrugged and said, \"Well, heck, that's like eight slices each.  That's practically a regular pizza each.  Plus, if this bad boy is as good as it sounds and smells....\" Kiba licked his lips and rubbed his growling tummy in anticipation.  He then turned to the waiter and said, \"Alright, we'll take one Maestro in whatever size you said it came in, and a few pitchers of soda.\"  The waiter smirked and said, \"Coming right up, boys.  Just sit tight and we'll bring The Maestro out in just a moment.\"  The four nodded then headed to a nearby table, awaiting their upcoming venture eagerly.  Hunter grinned toothily and said, \"I knew there was a reason my nose picked up on this pizza more than the usual kind...\"  Naruto smirked and said, \"I just hope this thing is as good as that guy said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the waiters came out carrying the massive pizza over to the boys' table, once again, filling their eyes with awe as 'The Maestro' was placed before them, along with their plates and beverages.  \"Welp, moment of truth...\" muttered Naruto as he, Hunter and Kiba all grabbed a slice of the cheesy, meat laden pizza.  In unison, all three took a huge bite, chewed a bit to get a good taste, then gulped it down.  Suddenly, silence struck the table.  Akamaru turned to the boys and pup.  <i>Well?  How is it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's....\" was all Naruto could mutter.  The anticipation was almost starting to get to Akamaru, until Hunter blurted out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...AMAZING!  H-holy cow, it's like eating a slice of Heaven itself...!\"  Both Hunter and Naruto proceeded to chomp away at the slice in their hands.  Kiba grinned to Akamaru and pulled a slice for him and said, \"Here you go, boy!  Taste for yourself!\"  Akamaru's tail wagged as he took a big, gaping bite out of his slice.  Like with the others, his eyes lit up with disbelief.  <i>...If this is pizza...then what have we been eating all this time...?</i>  As with the others, Akamaru immediately began scarfing away at his slice.</span></div></div>",

Cooked just right, the exact amount of seasonings...\" he trailed off as he opened his mouth wide and tore a massive piece off, continuing to tear into the slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded enthusiastically as he tore a piece off his own slice. \"Yeah, and even the veggies taste great!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru continued wolfing down his slice, his own tail wagging at breakneck speed. &lt;i&gt;Only problem: any pizza we eat from here on out is gonna taste like crap compared to this!&lt;/i&gt; Hunter and Kiba giggled; Naruto, not understanding any of it, simply continued tearing into his piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed as the four continued tearing into their slices of pizza, until only the cheese-filled crust remained. Licking their lips, all three youngsters chomped down on a piece of the crust and pulled away, pulling a string of gooey, melted cheese along with it. Grinning, they slurped the cheese up and chewed. Akamaru, on the other hand, ripped off half of the crust and chomped on it, his own eyes lighting up at the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to wait any longer, the three young ones stuffed the rest of their crusts into the mouth, cheeks bulging as they chewed. Finally, after a few long seconds, they swallowed, licked their lips, and promptly helped themselves each to another slice (with Kiba taking an extra for Akamaru). Exchanging delighted looks, the four began tearing into their second slices. Then a third. Then a fourth, as they completely lost themselves in the delicious flavors of the pizza.</span></div></div>",

Unbeknownst to them, however, was just how filling each slice of pizza truly was.  By the time they'd all reached their fourth slice, their tummies had begun to bulge rather noticeably from beneath their respective shirts.  Even Akamaru's belly was beginning to distend from his pizza consumption.  Bite after bite, the boys continued chomping away at their fourth slices.  After reaching around half way in, Naruto began to slow his pace down, as he winced, feeling his belly push outward.  Neither Kiba nor Hunter were fairing much better.  Nevertheless, the flavor bomb was too great to allow anyone to flag just yet.  So, they all pushed on, one small bite at a time, still enjoying the taste in each bite, until they'd all finish scarfing down the cheesy crust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon completion, the boys and pup; in unison, sighed with relief, and leaned back in their chairs, their bellies pushing outward, but still contained beneath their shirts.  Resting his hand on his tummy, Naruto smirked and said, \"Wow...I don't think I've EVER eaten pizza that filling before...\"  Kiba burped, then giggled, massaging his own bloated tummy in the process.  \"You're telling me.  Sheesh, can you imagine if we actually DID get one of these per person?\"  Hunter laughed, while Akamaru shuddered at the thought.  <i>They'd have to tear down an entire wall just to roll all four of us out of here...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Hunter laughed at his remark as Kiba ruffled the big dog's head and said, \"I'm surprised you've been able to keep up with us so far.  Nice job, boy!\"  Akamaru glanced down at his furry bloated belly and smirked a bit.  <i>What can I say?  It's not every day I get to wolf down one of the best pizzas ever conceived by human hands.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto poured himself a glass of soda from his pitcher and began gulping it down while Hunter glanced down at his own distended belly and chuckled.  \"Wow, you weren't kidding about how filling this thing is!  Heh, hope we can all still finish it,\" Hunter said.  Placing his now empty cup down, Naruto burped loudly and sighed with relief as he patted his belly proudly, then said, \"Sure we can!  This pizza may be filling, but I've never come across a pizza I couldn't scarf down!\"  Kiba grinned and said, \"Me neither!  How about you, boy?\"  Akamaru's tail wagged as Kiba tore him another slice.  <i>I've never come across a pizza worth scarfing down anywhere near as much as this one.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Akamaru began getting to work on his fifth slice.  Kiba smirked at the sight then turned to Naruto and Hunter and said, \"So now that we're all rested up, whadduya say we follow Akamaru's example and get to work on slice number five?\"  Naruto grinned and grabbed himself another slice.  Kiba and Hunter did the same.  Wasting no time, all four were right back at it, scarfing down their next slice of pizza, though still at a slightly slower pace than earlier...</span></div></div>",

After all, to leave anything this tasty uneaten seemed a crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, but surely, their fifth slices began to shrink as they vanished down their gullets, the four savoring every single bite. The only interruptions were an occasional burp, or a pause to take a deep swig of soda, after which they immediately resumed eating. In minutes, they had eaten their fifth slices, and were already reaching in for their sixth slices. Kiba burped a bit queasily, but nonetheless lowered a sixth slice to Akamaru. Barking appreciatively, Akamaru began working on it, as did the three youngsters. The three only spent a minute or two eating, however, before all three winced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerned, Akamaru looked up, licking sauce off his muzzle. &lt;i&gt;Guys? Is everything OK?&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweating a bit, Kiba smiled. \"Y-yeah, we're fine, buddy.\" Grunting, he reached down to his waistline. \"Pants are just feelin' a bit tight is all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto giggled, even as he fumbled with his own pants button. \"Eh, why don't we just pop 'em? It's fun, and it'd be a lot quicker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter rolled his eyes as he managed to get a good grip on his pants button. \"Normally, I'd be all for that, but the sooner we get rid of this tightness, the better chance we'll be able to keep eating.\" He pulled the button out and undid it, sighing happily as the pressure abated and his stomach bulged out a little more. Kiba and Naruto, in that order, did the same, grinning like goofs as their waistlines were freed up and their stomachs pushed forward a little more; a little strip of flesh had even begun to peek out at the bottom of Kiba's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh man, that feels better,\" Naruto grinned, rubbing his bloated tummy. \"Not feeling nearly as full now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded, tail wagging. \"Yeah; I was actually gettin' worried for a second there.\" He beamed as he looked over the slice in his hands and the remaining pizza on the table. \"I actually think we might be able to finish this bad boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, smirking, opened his mouth wide and ripped off a big piece of his slice, newly invigorated. \"Then what are we waiting for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently, Naruto and Hunter agreed, as they began tearing into their slices with renewed vigor. As they did so, the effects became apparent; Hunter's tank top and Kiba's t-shirt, slowly but surely, began rising upwards slowly. Naruto's hoodie was also being affected, albeit in a different way: as he crammed more of the delicious pizza in his mouth and his stomach bulged more and more, a couple of the teeth of his hoodie strained noticeably, before popping apart, giving a tiny glimpse of the short-sleeved blue t-shirt he wore underneath...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With each gooey, meat and sauce lathered bite of pizza consumed, their bellies continued to distend outward just ever so slightly.  With every few, more of the teeth from Naruto's hoodie began to un-pop from each other, but the young blond was too busy demolishing his pizza to notice.  However, as Hunter ate, one of his ears twitched; catching the sound of the zipper on Naruto's hoodie beginning to snap open.  He turned and saw Naruto's tummy pushing his hoodie open.  Stopping for a moment, he began to snicker a bit, catching Kiba's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errrm...hehe...N-Naruto?\" Hunter attempted to warn, too amused by the boy's obliviousness.  Stopping mid-bite, Naruto turned to Hunter, mouth full of pizza.  Gulping down a heaping mouthful, he sighed with relief and said, \"What's up, Hunter?\" before turning right back to his pizza and taking another huge bite.  Giggling a bit himself, Kiba pointed down to Naruto's zipper as it was nearing closer and closer to reaching the top, his belly distending outward a bit more as more of the teeth pop open.  \"Oi, bonehead.  Hehe, ya might wanna unzip that thing before it-\" before Kiba could finish, the zipper snapped open, causing his hoodie to burst open and expose Naruto's blue t-shirt, and causing his stomach to push outward slightly more as a result.  He simply stared for a moment, eyes widened in surprise.  \"Oops.\"  Both Hunter and Kiba began laughing as a result.  Naruto scowled a bit.  Akamaru, seeing Naruto's busted hoodie, smirked  to himself.  <i>I guess busting the zipper was quicker than unzipping...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Hunter and Kiba laughed some more as Naruto grunted in annoyance and said, \"C'mon, no fair!\"  Kiba grinned a bit and said, \"You said earlier that it would be more fun and quicker to bust our buttons than unbutton ourselves.  He said you figured it'd be quicker to bust your zipper than unzip instead.\"  Naruto scoffed for a moment, but quickly started giggling a bit himself, shortly after and started patting his tummy proudly and said, \"Well, for your information, it WAS.  And while you two were busy laughing at my broken zipper, I was too busy enjoying this awesome pizza!\"  He then proceeded to stuff the rest of his sixth slice into his mouth, and with a hearty gulp, sent the hefty mouthful down his throat, and into his bloated tummy, causing it to push outward and making his now exposed blue t-shirt rise up just slightly, now only barely containing his tummy.  Sighing happily, he burps loudly and grins, then grabs his seventh slice and looks back at the others, grinning impishly, then says, \"Better hurry up, boys.  Those last few slices aren't gonna eat themselves, right?\"  He then opened wide and took a huge bite, grinning cockily as he chewed vigorously on the mouthful of pizza in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Kiba shared a glance, then grinned to each other, before hauling to finish their sixth slices as well...</span></div></div>",

Seeing that Naruto was almost done with his slice, they both narrowed their eyes and began chomping down even faster, causing their sizable slices to disappear even quicker. Eventually, they had caught up enough that, by the time Naruto tossed the last piece of cheesy crust into his mouth, they had only their own crusts left. Not wanting to be left in the dust, they crammed the entire things into their mouths, cheek bulging as they chewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, swallowing his own crust, looked up at them. <i>Easy there, guys; don't try to swallow too much at once.</i> As if to punctuate this point, Hunter's eyes went wide as he attempted to swallow the mass of bread and cheese; as it had only been chewed a bit, it got slightly stuck. Naruto and Kiba looked towards him with concern, but Hunter waved a dismissive hand even as the other pounded on his chest. Eventually, the food went down, and he breathed a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog wagged his tail. <i>See what I mean?</i> He suddenly stopped as he felt his stomach; owing to his consumption of six huge, deep-dish slices of pizza, it now felt very heavy. <i>Ugh...Hold on a second.</i> He rolled over onto his back, letting his paws go limp. His belly, engorged with the six slices of pizza, was notably swollen, sticking up as a decently-sized sphere. <i>Urp...Kiba, could you give me a tummy rub?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba moved to oblige, but a tightness in his own stomach stopped him. \"Um...hold on a second, boy.\" Groaning, he leaned back in his chair, massaging his tummy. Naruto and Hunter, feeling similarly uncomfortable, did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough they had only consumed two slices since their initial break, the sheer size of them, and the fact that their bellies had already been filled with four rather large slices of pizza beforehand, ensured their their bellies had grown noticeably, pushing out more than before. In Hunter and Kiba's case, the small strips of furred and bare flesh, respectively, that had begun to peek out from their shirts when they'd undone their pants, had grown as their shirts had been forced higher and higher. Naruto's shirt, additionally, had begun rising up slightly, exposing a small sliver of flesh. In addition, some of the teeth of their flies had been pried apart by their growing bellies, though they were a good way from being fully unzipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...\" Naruto moaned, massaging his midsection. \"My tummy feels really heavy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba burped queasily. \"Ain't gonna argue with you there, bonehead...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter licked his maw as he looked at the other two. \"Well, those slices were freakin' huge; only makes sense we're getting full.\" He massaged his own swollen midsection, unable to suppress a grin. \"Not to mention the fact our guts are like this.\" He burped, giggling. \"Kinda fun, ain't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of his discomfort, Naruto grinned. \"Yeah, it is; 'specially since we're like this right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Kiba leaned back in his chair, folding his arms behind his head. \"Yeah, I think I could get used to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled. \"Well, I still have lotsa that little concoction left,\" he giggled at his own pun, \"back at the inn, so we could spend <i>days</i> like this!\" He looked down at Akamaru. \"Heck, I even have enough for Akamaru, if he wants in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's eyes widened, but he grinned at the thought. Akamaru perked up, curious. \"Ya hear that, boy?\" Kiba asked as he beamed down at the dog. \"How would ya like to spend a few days riding around on my head again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, surprised, nonetheless wagged his tail. <i>I think that'd be fun.</i> He sniffed the air, the aroma of the remaining pizza causing his mouth to water in spite of his fullness. <i>First, though, can we finish this pizza? It's too good to leave alone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba winced as he felt the fullness in his belly, but he brushed it off. \"Sounds like a plan!\" He retrieved a seventh piece for Akamaru, then took one for himself. He looked at the other two youngsters, grinning. \"You ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Hunter moaned a bit, but, never one to pass up a challenge, they nodded and took their own seventh slices. With nods to one another, the four began tackling their new slices, taking small bites, but determined not to fail now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All four chomped vigorously; through shorter bites but at a much quicker pace between bites.  Kiba took several bites at a time before stopping occasionally to chew on a heaping mouthful and eventually send the gaping mouthful down his throat with a hearty gulp, each time, he would occasionally gasp heavily due to the vast content being deposited into his distending tummy at once.  Spotting this, Hunter smirked and said, \"Careful, Kiba.  I tried biting off more than I could chew a few times, and it started hurting after a while.\"  After gulping down a hefty mouthful, Kiba winced then thumped his chest a few times then burped sharply before giggling and sighing with relief.  \"Ah, don't sweat it, Wolf-ieeeerrr...Hunter.  The only person who's a big enough goof to actually choke from eating too much at once is king goof over there,\" Kiba said, grinning mischievously as he pointed towards Naruto, who scowled with a mouthful of pizza.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping it down, he scoffed then said, \"How was I supposed to know the guy making my boneless wings forgot the BONELESS part?\"  Immediately, both Hunter and Kiba started snickering, even Akamaru couldn't hold back a chuckle or two.  Blushing a bit with embarrassment, Naruto eventually rolled his eyes and smirked a bit, then said, \"Ah, whatever...\" suddenly, Naruto grinned.  \"Buuuuuut, in case you three didn't notice....\" he held his large slice of pizza forward for emphasis, showing the three that he'd eaten more of his pizza than the others.  Immediately, they all proceeded to speed things up a bit, taking faster and more frequent bites at a time of their large slices of pizza.  \"Don't choke now,\" mocked Naruto as he continued to scarf down his pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every passing bite, Kiba's t-shirt and Hunter's tanktop continued to rise up as their tummies continued to distend, exposing more flesh from Kiba and more fur from Hunter.  Naruto's own shirt had finally begun to rise up enough to expose a sliver of flesh beneath his blue t-shirt and busted hoodie.  Akamaru's own belly had seemingly seemed to inflate more and more, hanging well beneath him as he continued to chomp down on his seventh slice of pizza along with the three youths.  Occasionally, the three youths would stop and take a quick breath, down more of their drinks, or burp, then would resume chomping away at a surprisingly close knit competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Naruto finished his seventh slice of pizza just seconds before the others then held his arms up in victory.  \"Boo-ya!\" Naruto cheered as he leaned back in his chair and massaged his greatly bloated belly happily.  Kiba scoffed and said, \"More like Boo-nah, bonehead.  There's still another slice left for each of us.\"  Naruto's victorious grin died down to an expression of disappointment as he glanced down and saw one more massive, cheesy slice left.  \"...Right.\" he muttered, then glanced down at his swollen midsection, \"Man, I didn't think pizza was capable of fillin' me up like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassaging his own distended gut, Hunter belched then chuckled, \"Heh, awesome, isn't it?\"  Naruto grinned and nodded, burping suddenly, causing him to giggle a bit more.  His grin slanted to one of a more impish kind as he turned to Kiba and said, \"I'm still gonna totally demolish that last slice before any of you though.\"  Kiba scoffed then said, \"Pfft, yeah, in your dreams, Uzumaki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Akamaru rolled back onto his back, and let out a massive belch before sighing and letting his tongue hang from the side of his muzzle as his immensely bloated belly stuck upward.  <i>You know what?  It doesn't even matter who finishes first...eating this good?  That makes us all winners already...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smiled down at his fuzzy buddy and began scratching the big dog's bigger tummy.  \"You said it, boy!\"  Said Kiba as the dog's tail wagged.  He then turned to Naruto and; with an impish grin of his own, said, \"Still, finishing faster than the dope'll definitely a be a plus...\"  Naruto laughed then said, \"Ha, I bet!  It's just too bad that ain't gonna happen.\"  Hunter grinned with amusement, watching the two continue their competitive banter, then decided to get in on the competitive side some more.  \"Welp, whadduya guys say we settle this and see which of us can finish this tasty sucker off first?\"  Kiba grinned and said, \"Sounds like a plan to me!  You ready, Naruto?\"  Naruto grinned back and said, \"When it comes to food?  Always!\"  Akamaru, despite his immense fullness, rolled himself back on all fours as Kiba gave him his eighth and final slice.  <i>Hehe, what can I say?  No use letting this slice feel left out...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, all four got to wolfing down the last four slices of the Maestro...</span></div></div>",

Predictably, as they crammed more of the pizza into their mouths, their already-engorged tummies swelled even more. Hunter's tank top and Kiba's t-shirt slowly rose further up and exposing more of their bare stomachs as they crammed bite after delicious, cheesy bite into their maws, Naruto's following close behind, the tiny bit of flesh that had begun to be exposed growing in size. In the meantime, the gradual growth of their bellies was forcing the teeth of their respective flies open more and more. Akamaru's belly, already hanging well below him, got lower and lower as his slice slowly vanished into his waiting maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes ticked by as their slices shrank, their stomachs grew, and the heaviness in their tummies intensified. All four of them winced, but they pressed on, determined not to stop now that they were on a roll. Up the three youngsters' shirts slowly slid, and bigger and lower to the ground Akamaru's furry belly became....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Naruto, reaching the last of his cheesy crust, tossed it in his mouth, and smirked. &lt;i&gt;Heh! Done!&lt;/i&gt; Satisfied, he let out a loud burp...which sounded out at the exact same time three others did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smug expression quickly transformed into one of disgruntlement and understanding. \"Oh, come on!\" he protested, looking up at the other two. Sure enough, Kiba and Hunter had polished off their slices and were leaning back in their chairs, hands on their distended bellies and staring at Naruto with the same expression the blonde was wearing. Something suddenly occured to the three of them, and they looked down at Akamaru, who was busily licking his chops. Sensing something, the dog looked up a them and tilted his head. &lt;i&gt;Did...did we all just finish at the same time?&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Hunter nor Kiba said anything; instead, they merely looked at one another, then at Naruto...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter suddenly burst out laughing. \"N-no way!\" He managed through his gasps, tail wagging wildly. \"There were four of us, and we &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; tied?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Heh; looks that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, though looking slightly disgruntled, couldn't help but smirk in return. \"Ah, well; if I had to tie with anybody, I'm glad it was you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned...right before he groaned and slumped back in his chair, rubbing his belly. \"Oh man...I feel like I'm gonna bust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling similar discomfort in their stomachs, Naruto and Kiba did the same, doing what they could to ease their discomfort. Akamaru, unable to rub his stomach like they did theirs, simply rolled onto his back and let his tongue loll out the side of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter consuming eight immense slices of pizza each, their stomachs were all noticeably distended, pushing out even more than they had been earlier in their meal. Hunter and Kiba's shirts had risen up enough to expose a sizable amount of furred and bared flesh, respectively, and were even exposing their navels. Naruto's blue t-shirt had ridden up quite as high, but it was nonetheless situated right above his belly-button. In addition, each of their respective flies were all but fully opened, and though none of them were sitting at the proper angle, their respective undergarments were fully exposed. Akamaru's tummy, on the other hand, had taken on the appearance of a white, furry beach ball that had even begun to force his back legs apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba burped, gently rubbing his belly. \"Oh man...I feel like I might pop...\" his face split in a happy grin. \"...but I haven't eaten anything that good in &lt;i&gt;ages&lt;/i&gt;.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru burped, licking his maw. &lt;i&gt;You said it, little buddy.&lt;/i&gt; He fixed Kiba with a pleading stare. &lt;i&gt;Can you rub my tummy now?&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba reached down, scratching Akamaru's engorged midsection and causing one of his hind legs to kick. Naruto and Hunter laughed at the sight, before going back to their own ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the attendant who had welcomed them walked by to collect their plates and empty tray. As he picked them up, he threw approving glances at the two stuffed kids, stuffed anthro-pup, and the equally stuffed dog that was lying on the floor beside their table, belly up. \"Heh; looks like you all enjoyed the Maestro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter licked his muzzle, burping contentedly and looking up at the man. \"Sure did; that was the best pizza I ever had!\" He fished around in his pocket, pulling out his wallet and getting the cash to pay the man, which the latter accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto giggled, wiggling a finger around in his exposed navel. \"Yeah! I'm normally a ramen kinda guy, but I'm definitely coming back here again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled. \"Glad to hear you enjoyed it!\" He spared a glance at their stuffed bellies. \"You, uh, need any help getting out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba waved a dismissive hand. \"Thanks, but I think we're good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man raised an eyebrow. \"Well...all right.\" He smiled. \"Well, you kids have a good day.\" Nodding, he turned and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four watched him leave, continuing to rub their stomachs for a few seconds. Then, takinga deep breath, the three youngsters,slid out of their chairs, rubbing their bellies with one hand and holding up their pants with the other. Akamaru, in turn, flipped back onto his feet; he stumbled a bit, owing to his midsection, but he managed to regain a semblance of balance. The big dog wagged his tail, barking happily. &lt;i&gt;Well, that was a heck of a meal.&lt;/i&gt; He looked at the three kids trying to keep their balance. &lt;i&gt;Where to now?&lt;/i&gt; Before any of the three could reply, he cut in again. &lt;i&gt;Actually, before we do anything else, can we head back to the inn?&lt;/i&gt; He winked at Hunter. &lt;i&gt;I think I'm gonna take you up on your offer.&lt;/i&gt; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's confused expression quickly became one of glee. \"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru nodded. &lt;i&gt;It'll be nice to be a pup again, even if only for a little bit.&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, happy at Akamaru's decision, decided to add his own two bits. \"Awesome! And while we're at it, we'll re-dose so we can stay like this for another day or so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he didn't understand Kiba and Hunter's initial reactions to Akamaru's decision, for obvious reasons, Naruto raised an eyebrow. \"Wait; if we take another drink of that stuff, won't we go back too far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled reassuringly. \"Don't worry, Naruto. I've done it before; the potion can't regress you any further than it initially does; just makes it last longer.\" He began stumbling off, holding his shorts up. \"Now c'mon, we're burning daylight here!\" Kiba and Akamaru were only too happy to follow. Naruto was still slightly confused, but he followed behind them anyway.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After what seemed like forever; due to the sheer size of their midsections, the three engorged youths and bloated big dog made their way back to the inn, where; upon arrival, Hunter eagerly grabbed four more vials of his regression potion.  Sighing contently, Naruto plopped down on the bed, causing his belly to stick upward as he rested both hands atop it.  \"Hey, don't tell me you're tired already!\" said Kiba, still massaging his own distended tummy as he spoke.  Burping wetly, Naruto shook his head then said, \"I'm just reeaaally full right now...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Hunter pulled out the vials and said, \"Sounds like you're in need of another dose of the potion.  So, here you go, guys.  Drink up!\"  He then proceeded to hand Naruto a vial, two for Kiba and Akamaru, and kept one for himself.  Leaning down, one hand still rested on his bloated tummy, Kiba ruffled Akamaru's head and said, \"You might feel a lil funny after you drink the stuff, but don't worry, you'll feel right as rain like immediately after.\"  Akamaru barked eagerly as he opened his maw nice and wide for Kiba to pour the vial down his fuzzy buddy's mouth.  Seeing this, Naruto grinned and said, \"No wonder you two were so excited back at that pizza place!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru lapped his tongue a few times.  <i>Huh, you weren't kidding, my whole body feels kinda....tingly....</i>  Just then, Akamaru winced as he felt his body begin to shrink immensely.  In a matter of moments, the giant dog opened his eyes, and noticed everything; the boys especially, were substantially larger than they were before.  In addition to which, he felt a large burst of energy he hadn't felt since...<i>I...I'm a pup again!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's eyes widened as he smiled and said, \"Wow, who'd have guessed a dog so big could ever be so small?\"  Smiling down at his little buddy, Kiba scooped up the tiny pup with both hands and smiled a wide mouth smile at Akamaru.  \"How do ya feel, buddy?\"  Akamaru barked a happy, pup bark as his tail wagged immensely.  Both Hunter and Naruto smiled at the sight.  \"Awwww, I forgot how adorable he was as a puppy,\" said Naruto.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru happily licked Kiba's face, earning a laugh from the ticklish young dog-nin before he immediately propped the pup on top of his head.  Kiba laughed then reached up and scratched the pup behind the ears as he said, \"Just like the old days, eh, buddy?\"  Akamaru barked happily.  <i>I almost forgot how much I enjoyed just lazing around up here!  Boy...this takes me back...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we should probably take our dose too, right?\"  suggested Naruto.  In unison, all three bloated youths then proceeded to down their own vials shortly after.  \"Huh, I don't feel as funny as I did last time,\" noted Kiba.  Hunter grinned then said, \"Well, of course you don't.  We've already regressed, afterall!\"  Naruto smirked then said, \"I actually feel a lil more energetic again!  How about you guys?\"  Kiba examined himself for a moment, then nodded, \"Y'know, now that you mention it....yeah, me too!\"  Hunter smiled and said, \"Drinking more not only extends your regression period, but it also gives you a lil boost of energy too.  Like waking up after a good nap.  Good thing too, cause the day is still young!\"  Naruto laughed as he nudged the anthro-pup in the shoulder playfully and said, \"Amen to that!  Sooooo then, whadduya guys wanna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four youths thought for a moment, until someone suggested...</span></div></div>",

Not to mention,\" his hands went down to his waist and gripped his undone pants. \"We'd hafta be holding our pants up the whole time, and I dunno about you, but that doesn't sound like much fun to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru yipped from the top of Kiba's head, <i>He's got ya there, Naruto.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scowled, but nonetheless blushed when he realized Kiba was right. \"W-well, then, what do <i>you</i> think we should do?\" Kiba raised a finger as he opened his mouth...only for the finger to drop down and his mouth to shut. Naruto snickered, while Akamaru looked down at Kiba from his perch. <i>Heh; he got you too, Kiba.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, having climbed up onto the edge of the bed, looked down at the others as he kicked his legs idly. \"I have an idea; how about we hang around here for a bit until our stomachs go down enough for us to button our pants, then we can go play?\" He flopped back on the bed, splaying his arms out to the side. \"'Sides, while I'm not really feeling tired, I don't really feel like running around just yet, either.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba looked at Hunter, then back at each other. The blonde boy shrugged. \"Eh, sounds good to me. What about you, Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba folded his arms and looked away. \"Well, I'd rather be doin' something, to be honest...but I guess it's as good a plan as any.\" Akamaru barked his agreement, tail wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned. \"Great! And to pass the time...\" he hopped down from the bed and made his way over to his duffel. \"...I got all sortsa cool stuff in my bag we can look at to pass the time.\" He winced. \"Just, uh...if one of 'em starts whispering arcane secrets into your ear, throw it as far away as you possibly can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised an eyebrow. \"Uh...OK?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined, looking down at Kiba from his perch. <i>He's crazy, isn't he?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked up at him, nodding. \"Uh-huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blushed a bit, but quickly regained his cheerful demeanor. \"Alright! Now that that's taken care of...\" He began rummaging around in his duffel. \"...let's find something to do while we wait!\" Naruto and Kiba looked at each other and grinned, rushing up to either side of Hunter as they, too, reached their hands in and began rummaging around. Even Akamaru hopped off Kiba's head and began nosing around, trying to find something appealing inside.</span></div></div>",

Hunter laughed and said, \"Neat, huh?  That's called an mp3 player.\"  Kiba, Naruto and Akamaru's heads all tilted in confusion.  Hunter rolled his eyes and laughed to himself.  \"You guys know what music is, right?  Well, in my world, and some other worlds I've visited, most people walk around with these devices so they can listen to their favorite music wherever they go!  It's great for when you go for longs walks, train, reading, or if you just wanna kick back and listen to your favorite tunes!\"  He stopped himself from continuing when he saw how lost the others still were.  Rolling his eyes again, Hunter pressed the play button and held the ear buds close to the three so they could listen for themselves as music started playing.  \"Whoa!\" exclaimed Naruto as he listened closer.  Akamaru gaped as the sounds began emanating from the buds.  <i>People walk around with musicians trapped in these devices?!  Forget crazy, he's a witch!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed and continued rummaging through his bag.  Suddenly, Naruto remembered one device from earlier.  \"Hey, Hunter.  What about that phone from earlier?  You got any more pictures of other world people on it?\"  Hunter smiled and pulled it out.  \"You kidding?  This bad boy's got 32 Gigs of space!  I've got more pictures than I know what to do with!\"  Naruto scratched his head at the terminology.  Nonetheless, he and Kiba gathered around while Akamaru was still trying to figure out where the voices from the device were coming from.  Flipping through the many photos, Hunter eventually caught up to the pictures he'd left off on.  \"Now, THIS is someone I think you guys would'a definitely gotten along with at some point,\" Hunter noted as he flipped to a picture of a young man with an open vest, sandals, a scarf and spiky pink hair.  Next to him, a flying cat.  Both had big smiles on their faces.  \"This here is Natsu Dragneel, and that lil fella there is Happy!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sure looks happy!\" noted Naruto.  Hunter laughed.  \"No, no, that's his name.  He's Natsu's best bud.  Believe it or not, but this guy's a dragon slayer who can actually swallow and breathe fire on a whim!  He's what's known down there as a fire mage.  Beyond that?  He's a really nice and funny guy, one of the biggest eaters I've ever seen...though, he's not all that bright.\"  Grinning, Kiba turned to Naruto and said, \"Heh, I bet you two would get along real well.\"  Hunter snickered a bit while Naruto glared at Kiba in annoyance.  Suddenly, the image changed to a really short blond teen in black, wearing a red coat.  Next to him, what looked like a giant suit of armor, both waving at the camera.  \"This here is Edward Elric and his younger brother Alphonse.  He's known in his world as the 'FullMetal Alchemist.'  Pretty fitting title, I'd say.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Naruto and Kiba examined the suit of armor and nodded.  \"No kidding.  The guy looks like he's MADE of metal!\" noted Naruto.  Kiba nodded and added, \"Yeah, and how much older is he than the Alphonse kid?  Cause he looks like he's twice his size!\"  Hunter laughed and said, \"No no, Al is the suit of armor.  Ed's the little guy.\"  Immediately, both gaped.  \"...What?  But...he's so tiny!\" noted Kiba.  Hunter rubbed the back of his head sheepishly and smirked, \"He sure is...juuuuuust make sure he doesn't catch you hearing that.  He's a little...animated, when it comes to his height.  But beyond that, he's a real nice, and incredibly smart guy.  He's one of those 'put others before yourself' types, who always goes around helping people and stopping bad guys with his brother.\"  Naruto smirked.  \"Heh, sounds like a pretty cool guy.\"  He then grinned impishly and added, \"but seriously, look at how small he is.  I bet he wouldn't even last one round in a ramen eating contest.\"  Hunter raised an eyebrow and added, \"Don't be so sure, Naruto.  This guy might be short, but he eats like a shark who hasn't eaten in weeks.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter continued, Akamaru trotted over and dug through the bag.

What's this?</i> Curious, he took part of it in his mouth, tugging it out into the open. Releasing it, he looked down at it curiously. <i>What the heck...</i> He lifted his head and yipped, <i>Oi, Kiba!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his head, the young dog nin focused on his buddy. \"Yeah? What is it, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru indicated the object. <i>Come take a look at this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Kiba got up and made his way over to Akamaru. Hunter, curious to see exactly what they'd found, followed close behind. Naruto, not understanding a thing Akamaru had said, nonetheless followed, wondering what all the fuss was about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching Akamaru, Kiba knelt down, examining the object Akamaru had found. \"Looks kinda weird; what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled as he reached the two and knelt down as well. \"I believe I can help with...\" he trailed off as his eyes fell upon the object, his smile rapidly fading and the color draining from beneath his fur. \"Ohhhh, crap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Naruto knelt down and leaned in close to the object. \"Huh? What's the big deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe object in question was rather odd in appearance; it consisted of a small, flat stand with two spires sticking up on either side of it. Naruto, confused, tilted his head. \"Seriously, what's the big deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter didn't answer; he was too busy hyperventilating. \"Oh crap oh crap oh crap, how did this end up in my bag oh my GOD we're all screwed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked at the young anthro-pup, blinking. \"What? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, staring at the object, suddenly began to get a very uneasy feeling. <i>Um, guys...</i> However, none of the three heard him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter gulped, whimpering. \"I kinda have a bad habit of collecting dangerous objects; artifacts capable of leveling entire buildings, devices capable of rending the fabric of space-time, prisons holding beings of great evil and power...\" He slowly turned his head towards the now rather ominous artifact. \"This falls into that last category.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba gulped, sweating a bit. \"And, uh, what does this hold...?\" He winced, immediately regretting the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru yelped as the artifact began to hum with power, the spires starting to turn red. <i>Guys, seriously...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stayed silent for a few seconds before answering. \"In his world, the guy went by the title of the Dark Lord. He was defeated in battle and his physical body destroyed, but he lived on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a ghost?!\" Naruto blurted, his face going white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged. \"Sort of, but minus the actually-being-dead part. Anyway, he lived on for centuries, manipulating events and people to his advantage, and he managed to amass a huge army. Thankfully, they lost, and the artifact binding his presence to the mortal plane was destroyed, reducing him to a mere spirit...\" He gulped again, tugging at the collar of his tank-top. \"...but he'd thought ahead, and had his minions construct a reliquary of sorts to hold his essence. I happened to blunder into that world around that time, and figured, hey, the further away he was from that world, the better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and so you picked it up, even though it contained an evil spirit,\" Kiba finished, fixing Hunter with a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined, backing away in fright from the artifact as a small ball of blazing orange light began forming between the spires. <i>Guys...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, in spite of his fright, scowled. \"Hey, it seemed like a good idea at the time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GUYS!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the piercing bark, all three turned their attention towards the young pup. Kiba, briefly wearing a shocked expression, looked towards Akamaru. \"What is it boy? Is something...\" his eyes widened as he noticed the steadily-growing ball of light...no, <i>fire</i>...that was arising between the two spires. \"Oh, crap!\" Without thinking, he lunged forward and scooped up Akamaru, pulling back and holding the little pup protectively to his chest. Hunter and Naruto, however, were too transfixed by the sight of the ball of fire which was beginning to rise into the air above the artifact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter,\" Naruto asked faintly, his brain still trying to process what was happening. \"What's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, equally quiet, but knowing full well what was coming, replied. \"I think he's coming outta the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the ball of fire exploded outwards, thankfully not torching anything but causing the three youths to hold a hand up to their faces and shut their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Who dares disturb me?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the horrible, booming voice, the four young creatures trembled, but managed to lower their hands and slowly blink open their eyes as they looked towards the ball of fire...and their eyes widened in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball of fire had now becoming a gigantic, flaming <i>eye</i>, a slit, reptilian pupil smack dab down the center of it. The eye focused squarely on the four, and each of them shuddered as they felt the pure malice pouring out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter quivered, but managed to stammer out a response. \"L-Lord Sauron, forgive me; I didn't...\" The eye's pupil narrowed, the fire composing it blazing harder as it focused on Hunter. Yelping, the anthro-pup cowered, covering his ears and shaking. Neither Naruto nor Kiba were quite at that point yet, but their lips were quivering, Kiba clutching Akamaru's shaking body even closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Flattery will not avail you, maggot,</b></i>, the entity-Sauron's-booming voice echoed. <i><b>Did you honestly believe you could take Sauron, the Lord of Mordor, and take him captive as though he were some sort of mere trinket?</b></i> The Dark Lord's voice became even angrier as the left few words left him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking uncontrollably now, Hunter still managed to say, \"O-o-of c-course not, L-Lord Sauron. I just admired your...\" The pup whined as the eye blazed even greater, the fury practically blazing out of it. \"S-surely we can negotiate...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kiba, and Akamaru looked at him with widened eyes. Akamaru was the first to speak. <i>Hunter, are you cra...</i> He thought for a moment. <i>Well, OK, I KNOW you're crazy, considering you brought something like THAT with you...but you seriously wanna negotiate with that thing?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSauron, fortunately, only heard this as a series of whines and barks. It appeared to mull over Hunter's request for a moment, while the rest all waited on pins and needles, chewing their lips and whimpering (human AND canine). Finally, the eye refocused on Hunter and declared, <i><b>I find this acceptable. You three!</b></i> The eye suddenly focused on the young shinobi and the young pup, who all shrank back in its glare. <i><b>Leave this room, and do not re-enter until the Dark Lord bids you.</b></i> It refocused on the cowering anthro-pup. <i><b>The warg-child and I have matters we must discuss.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba looked at each-other, briefly pondering Sauron's odd wording, but their expressions quickly became ones of concern when they looked at the still-terrified Hunter. In spite of this, Hunter managed a weak smile and a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Naruto and Kiba got to their feet, Akamaru in tow, and hastened to the door, opening it and walking outside, shutting the door and standing outside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent a few seconds standing in silence before Naruto turned to Kiba and asked, \"Do you...do you think Hunter's going to be OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba tried to smirk, but it didn't look very convincing. \"I hope so, bonehead...\" he sighed as he placed Akamaru back on top of his head. \"I hope so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two spent several tense minutes waiting, occasionally glancing at each other and worrying about Hunter. Finally, after what seemed like forever, Sauron's voice boomed, <i><b>You may enter.</b></i> Looking at each other and gulping, they slowly pushed the door open and stepped inside, dreading what they'd find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo their relief, Hunter, while still looking terrified, was otherwise completely unharmed, though the eye of Sauron still blazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>We have come to an accord,</b></i> Sauron growled, setting everyone's hair (or fur) on edge. <i><b>I shall once again retreat within the reliquary and spare you, but in return...</b></i></span></div></div>",

Carry on with your inconsequential existence, dullards.</b></i>  With that, the flaming eyeball dissipated and retreated back into the reliquary.  Leaving the four youths, mortified; none more so than Hunter, who was still shaking as the relic was once again nothing more than an inanimate object.  Akamaru whined, still fearful at the sight.  Kiba nuzzled the pup close and said, \"It's okay, buddy.  He's gone for now...I think...maybe...\"  <i>I'm just glad I didn't wet myself...again...</i>  Kiba couldn't help but chuckle a bit before adding, \"Not as glad as <i>I</i> am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto cautiously approached Hunter and asked, \"A-are you okay?\"  Hunter nodded, still too petrified to speak coherently.  Finally, after the shock of such a terrifying presence had faded slightly, he said, \"...I'm gonna have to think on this one at some point...\"  Kiba turned to Hunter and said, \"You're not seriously gonna send that thing back to its' world, are you?  What if it gets out and does who knows what?  I mean, shouldn't we be taking that relic and dumping it in the bottom of the ocea or something?\"  Then Hunter snapped back and said, \"Look, when pure evil tells you to do something, you don't ask questions.  You just nod your head and hope it doesn't turn you into a pile of ash, alright?\"  He then started smacking his forehead with his palm a few times, cursing himself angrily.  \"Stupid!  Stupid!  STUPID!!  Why'd I think taking that damn thing was a good idea?!  Why don't I ever THINK before I do these kindsa things?!  What the hell's wrong with me?!\" he barked to himself.  Akamaru leaned from his perch towards Kiba's ear.  <i>Might wanna take it easy, buddy.  We're still regressed, remember?  And I don't think we wanna see a crazy wolf-person getting emotional cause of this potion...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken back a bit, Naruto nonetheless walked up to the wolf-pup and patted him on the shoulder.  \"Hey, c'mon, ya just did what ya thought was a good idea.  It's not like WE'VE never done anything stupid like that, right Kiba?\"  Unable to suppress a smirk, Kiba said, \"Trust me, when it comes to boneheaded decision making, no one'll ever top king bonehead there.\"  Scowling, Naruto regained composure and said, \"I'm just saying, we all make mistakes.  And you know what?  If something that evil is MAD that you took it from its' home world?  Then I'd say you probably made the right move.\"  Kiba nodded then stepped in and said, \"Exactly, don't beat yourself up.  Sure, what ya did was risky and dumb beyond all comprehension-\"  Before he could continue down a tangent, both Naruto and Akamaru (from his perch) glared down at Kiba, causing him to stop and regather his words a little better as he chuckled sheepishly and cleared his throat.  \"-errm, but yeah, risky or not, keeping that fireball from his home world; I'm willin' to bet, is probably good for a LOT of people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stopped for a moment, then turned to Naruto, a bit hesitantly, \"Y-ya think so?\"  Naruto smiled and playfully nudged the anthro-pup in the arm and said, \"You betcha!\"  Processing everything the others had said, Hunter finally turned tothe rest and said, \"Y-y'know, maybe you guys are right.  Sure, he may melt us all to a pile of ash in a split second, but the people from his world are safe from his wrath.  And like you said, risky or not, it's better for the people of his world that he ISN'T there!\"  Naruto, Kiba and Akamaru all went white upon hearing that ash in a split second bit.  Nonetheless, Hunter gradually regained a slightly cheerful demeanor and smiled at them.  \"Thanks, guys!\"  Looking back down at the relic, he gulped and slowly and carefully picked it up as gently as he could.  He then reached with a free hand into his bag and pulled out a silver case which he slowly placed the relic into, before sealing it shut.  \"There.  This won't hold him, but at least he won't feel if anyone messes with his reliquary...\" Hunter explained.  Naruto sighed with relief and plopped onto his rump, leaning back as he said, \"Sheesh, what a day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back up, Hunter suddenly noticed something.  As looked down, he saw that his furry tummy had shrunken a considerable amount, to where his shorts once again fit enough.  \"Whoa...guess my life flashing before my eyes took longer than I thought...\"  Both Naruto and Kiba examined their own stomachs and saw that they too, had deflated a good amount, to where they could once again button and zip them without having to hold them up.  Regaining his composure, Naruto grinned and said, \"Whadduya guys say forget all this almost dying and go play before the sun goes down?\"  Kiba smirked back and said, \"Yeah, I think that's enough rummaging through demonic artifacts for one day...\" he then pet the pup on top of his head.  \"Wanna go play, boy?\"  Akamaru barked a cute puppy bark of excitement as a response.  Kiba laughed.  \"That's the spirit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned and said, \"Sounds like fun to me!  I can worry about what do with Sauron's reliquary later...\"  After carefully tucking the container back into his bag and stuffing the bag into a closet, Hunter then put the do not disturb sign on the door.  The four youths more than eagerly took their leave.  <i>Better pick up the pace before it gets dark, guys!</i></span></div></div>",

However, time <i>had</i> passed, and it sat low in the sky, casting the soothing oranges and reds of a sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto pouted, folding his arms. \"Ah, crap, the sun's already setting...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, rather more cheerful, nudged him playfully. \"Hey, we still got time; it's still pretty light out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked, Akamaru wagging his tail from his perch on top of Kiba's head. \"Yeah; quit being such a downer, Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto flushed. \"I-I wasn't being a downer!\" he protested. \"I-I was just saying, we don't have all day, and we still have these to work off...\" He rubbed his blue-shirted tummy absentmindedly; it had shrunken a good deal, but it still exposed a sliver of flesh just above his waistline. In addition, he still wore his busted hoodie, but it now looked more like an open vest than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled, patting Naruto on the back. \"Hey, don't worry about that; like I said, it's still light out, and if we play like we did earlier today...\" he rubbed his own belly, a sliver of brown-furred flesh poking out from underneath his tank-top. \"...we'll have these things worked off in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned, rubbing his own belly (which was in the same state as Naruto and Hunter's.) \"Sounds like a plan...but why don't we stop talking and start playing?\" His grin turned impish. \"No time like the present, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, in spite of himself, laughed. \"Yeah, I guess that's trMMMPH!\" His sentence was promptly cut off as Akamaru leapt off Kiba's head and onto the blonde boy's face. Taken completely off guard, Naruto toppled backwards. Before he'd even hit the grass, Akamaru leapt off Naruto's face, giving him just enough time to see Kiba rushing at him. \"H-hey, Kiba, that's not OOOF!\" He was once again cut off as Kiba tackled him to the ground. Scowling, Naruto managed to push Kiba aside and clamber to his feet, only for the young dog-nin to grab his ankles and cause him to fall. \"OW! Damn it, Kiba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter watched this for a few seconds, amused, before deciding that two-on-one wasn't quite fair. To that end, he dropped to all fours, dashed around, and, tongue lolling out the side of his mouth, pounced on top of Kiba. In his surprise, the young dog-nin let go of Naruto. Taking notice of this, Naruto scrambled to his feet once again, throwing an appreciative look at Hunter. \"Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned and gave a thumbs up...right before a sharp pain appeared in his leg. \"Ow!\" Wincing, he saw that Akamaru had clamped his teeth firmly onto his furry leg. \"Ah! Puppy teeth, puppy teeth!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked, even as he got to his feet. \"Nice one, Akamaru!\" He rushed towards Hunter, and the anthro-pup had only time enough to turn and widen his eyes before Kiba tackled him to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! Naruto, ya mind helpin' a pal out here?\" Hunter winced as he struggled with Kiba and Akamaru, the latter of whom had now clamped onto his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. \"Hey, I still owe ya.\" He rushed towards the three, just as Kiba managed to pin Hunter to the ground. Unfortunately, he miscalculated, and he ended up tackling both Kiba <i>and</i> Hunter, eliciting pained cries from the two youngsters as the four once again devolved into a rolling, cursing, laughing ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Immediately, Naruto rose from amidst the three dazed piles and held his arms up victoriously.  \"And that's how you d-oh...\" cheered Naruto, before stumbling on his words midway, eyes widening as the small white puppy leaped towards his face again.  All Naruto could do was watch as the tiny pup leaped in seemingly slow motion, before pouncing right on his face and causing the boy to stumble back with a sudden but expecting yelp.  Hunter and Kiba laughed amongst themselves, before Hunter grinned impishly at Kiba.  \"Ohhh Kiiiiba...\" he chanted.  Kiba turned, \"Eh?\"  And immediately, Hunter returned the favor and tackled him to the ground, causing the two youths to struggle around carelessly through the grass and dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime flew as minutes turned to hours, and sunset turned to evening, and the four youngsters were no less winded.  By the time they had finally worn themselves out, the moon had long since been shining down on the empty park.  The four youths laid on their backs, bruised up and dirty, panting for breath, but nonetheless, all with big, exhausted smiles upon their faces.  \"Phew...man!  That was *pants*...that was awesome!\" noted Hunter, barely able to catch his breath.  Kiba laughed and playfully punched the anthro-pup in the arm.  \"Heh...heh...didn't know you could...*pants*...hold your own like that, man!\"  Naruto simply smiled, resting peacefully upon the cool grass as Akamaru trotted towards him and licked his face.  <i>Good to know I can still whoop your butt even as a pup!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just laughed and ruffled the puppy's head playfully.  \"Awww, good game to you too, Akamaru!\"  said Naruto, oblivious to Akamaru's remark, earning a chuckle from the dog-nin and wolf-pup.  Suddenly, Hunter noticed the moon and started to laugh wearily, as he noted, \"Wow, time really does fly when you're having fun!\"  Kiba nodded then smirked as he said, \"See that, bonehead?  All that whining about it being too late to play, and we STILL played into the dead of night!\"  Naruto pouted a bit and said, \"I didn't say it was too late!  I-I just said...\" he stopped protesting for a moment, then flushed a bit before rubbing the back of his head and chuckling to himself, \"Heh, guess you're right.  It didn't even make a difference how late it was, cause even in the dark, I whooped all three'uh you!\"  Kiba raised an eyebrow.  \"Are you kiddin' me?!  Akamaru mopped the floor with you!\"  He grinned and added, \"And he's a tenth your size!\"  Naruto opened his mouth to respond, when suddenly a loud, hungry growl emanated from his stomach.  Blushing, he rested a hand atop his tummy, and grinned.  \"Welp, guess you weren't kiddin', Hunter.  Looks like our guts are worked off and THEN some!\" he added, noting that his tummy has shrunken back down to its' originally flat state, completely concealed by his roughed up blue t-shirt and hoodie.  Hunter laughed and patted his own once again thin stomach and nodded.  \"Yup!  If there's one thing I know that gets the metabolism running in a hurry, it's a lil friendly roughhousing!\"  Like Naruto, Hunter's own concealed stomach began to growl, as did Kiba's; also in the same state as the others.  Suddenly, an even louder hungry growl emanated, earning curious glances from the three, until they looked down at the young Akamaru, who was blushing like a rose beneath his white fur, covering his tummy sheepishly.  <i>What can I say?  Walloping Naruto left and right works up an appetite!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed and rose to his feet, picking up the puppy and scratching his tummy playfully.  \"Awww, don't worry, boy, we'll fix that soon enough.\"  Akamaru barked happily as Kiba placed him back on his head.  Naruto rose to his feet then helped Hunter to his feet as well.  Just then, Naruto spotted the lights of a late-night buffet not too far in the distance and licked his lips.  \"A buffet, eh?  Whadduya guys say we put give 'all you can eat' motto a run for its' money?\"  Hunter grinned and said, \"Sounds like a plan to me!\"  Kiba and Akamaru both nodded in agreement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the four entered the practically empty buffet and were immediately seated at a table not too far away from the food...</span></div></div>",

In addition to the massive plate he had grabbed for himself, he was also loading up another plate with much the same things for Akamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good few minutes before, sensing their plates could carry no more, the three youths hefted their overloaded plates (each reaching about three feet into the air, except Akamaru's, which reached \"only\" two feet into the air) into comfortable positions and staggered back to their table. Upon reaching it, they grunted and plopped the four plates onto the table. It creaked ominously under the weight, causing a jolt of alarm in all four, but it nonetheless held. Breathing a sigh of relief, the three promptly hopped back into their chairs, settled in, and grinned widely at the massively-loaded plates before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter licked his chops, tail wagging eagerly. \"Oh man, we're gonna be eating <i>good</i> tonight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba took a deep whiff of his food, his mouth watering. \"You're tellin' me; with all the food we have here, we're probably not gonna hafta eat for another <i>week</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto giggled, licking his lips. \"Who says we have to stop with these? If we feel up to it, we can go right back and load 'em back up!\" From atop Kiba's head, Akamaru whined, but said nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter beamed. \"Great idea, Naruto!\" He grinned mischievously. \"In fact, how about we go crazy, and we don't stop till we can't feel our feet, we're about to bust, and we can't see straight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Naruto grinned in return, looking at each other. \"I'm game if you are, bonehead,\" Kiba jabbed playfully. Naruto smirked. \"You bet it, dog-breath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed. \"It's decided, then! Let the feast commence!\" Wasting no further time, he dug in, shoveling treat after delicious treat into his maw. Naruto and Kiba, not wanting to be outdone, did the same with theirs. Akamaru remained on top of Kiba's head for a few seconds, staring at his plate. <i>...I'm gonna look like a white, furry bowling ball by the time this is over, aren't I?</i> Kiba, his mouth full of food, didn't reply, but he grinned and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru sighed. <i>Well, then, like Hunter said... let the feast commence.</i> With that, Akamaru hopped off Kiba's head onto the table and began digging into his own plate (careful not to swallow the bones, of course).</span></div></div>",

Not one slowed down remotely as they stuffed more and more of their various entrees into their gaping maws.  Hunter almost rapidly continued stuffing onion rings and fries down his throat, making big gaping mouthfuls before chewing and gulping them down heartily.  Naruto was munching down on as many rolls as he could fit into his big mouth, chomping and gulping left and right as his pile of rolls began to deplete rapidly.  Kiba grabbing as many beef strips as he could get a hold of and stuffing them right in his mouth, chewing relentlessly before taking big, hearty mouthfuls.  And Akamaru was taking huge gaping bites from his steak slices, taking only seconds between chewing before going for another bite and another and another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the four had finished that section of their plates, and moved onto more prominent portions.  Hunter grabbed a burger and took a huge gaping bite, smiling with delight as the juicy burger filled his mouth with a burst of sudden flavor.  \"Mmmm!  Wow!  Those itty bitty onions just burst in your mouth!\"  he exclaimed before taking another huge bite.  Naruto simply took his chopsticks and wasted no time shoveling his noodles into his mouth as if he were enjoying his fabled Ichiraku's, stuffing comically huge mouthfuls in his mouth before stopping to chew on the ample amount of noodles and gulping it down heartily.  Sighing with relief, he rubbed his belly happily and licked his lips.  \"It may not be Ichiraku's, but it's still pretty damn good!\"  After chomping down a few pastries from his plate, he grabbed his sticks and immediately went back for more noodles.  After gulping down an ample mouthful of rib meat, Kiba rolled his eyes and said, \"Always gotta open up with 'It may not be as good as Ichiraku's', don'tcha, bonehead?\"  Hunter chuckled, before gulping down the remainder of one of his burgers and smacking his lips then moving onto another.  Naruto chuckled and shrugged mid-gulp.  \"I don't wanna be a liar, now do I?\"  He stuck his tongue out then gulped down yet another gaping mouthful of noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time passed as more and more of the ample towers of food atop the dishes were beginning to shrink considerably.  As more and more food began to deplete, the boys' midsections began to distend once more.  While still complete concealed beneath their shirts, their tummies were beginning create a more than noticeable bulge which pushed their shirts outward as more and more food began to be deposited into their gullets.  Akamaru's own tummy was starting to protrude downward and make the pup look like something of a low rider, and his now tiny legs weren't going to provide him much footing at this rate.  Nevertheless, the four youths continued pressing onward, stopping only seconds to catch their breath and relish the ample flavor, before demolishing yet another segment of their plates, leaving it bone dry.  More and more they ate, and more and more their tummies continued to expand and grow, until finally, their plates had been reduced to little more than crumb remnants and bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back in their chairs, the boys and anthro-pup sighed heartily as they rested their hands atop their distended bellies.  Akamaru panted with relief before rolling onto his side and letting his bloated furry tummy rest on the table...</span></div></div>",

Akamaru, as a result of nearly two feet of food being packed into such a tiny body, now had a veritable white sphere sticking out from underneath him, stopping just above his tiny paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked down at his stomach, surprised. \"Wow, our tummies are already starting to show?\" He poked the exposed sliver of flesh and wiggled his finger in his belly button a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scoffed, even as he examined his own belly. \"Well, we did eat three feet of food; I guess we should expect that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter wagged his tail happily, scratching the exposed portion of his belly and causing his foot to start kicking a bit. \"Well, boys, I think it's safe to say we're off to a great start.\" Naruto and Kiba made exclamations of agreement and grinned. Even Akamaru wagged his tail, even as another burp escaped his muzzle. \"Of course...I could probably eat some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked. \"Yeah, me too. Besides, I can still see straight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I can still feel my feet,\" Kiba finished, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter beamed. \"Then what're we waiting for?\" He hoisted himself out of his chair, stumbling a bit as his feet/paws hit the floor. \"Let's load up again!\" Naruto and Kiba, all too eager to take Hunter up on his suggestion, did the same, stumbling but quickly regaining their balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru started to follow them, but stopped when he saw his belly. &lt;i&gt;Uh, Kiba, I don't think I'm gonna fit on your head.&lt;/i&gt; Kiba and Hunter laughed good-naturedly at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, pal,\" Kiba grinned, scratching the white, fluffy sphere that stuck out from Akamaru's abdomen and causing the pup's hind leg to kick in delight. \"Anything you want us to bring you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru thought for a second. &lt;i&gt;Hmm...how about some vanilla ice cream? It'll help cool my tummy down a bit.&lt;/i&gt; His tail wagged. &lt;i&gt;Even if I end up looking like a white, fluffy beach ball by the time this is over, I fully intend to keep up with you guys.&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba giggled, ruffling Akamaru's head. \"Can do! We'll get you a great big bowl of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. \"That gives me an idea.\" At this, Hunter and Kiba regarded him curiously. \"How about this time, we just get dessert stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Heh; for once, that's a pretty good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rubbed the back of his head. \"Heh heh, tha---hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed. \"Chill, Naruto; that is actually a great idea.\" Without waiting for a response, he moved as quickly as he could towards the buffet line. \"Dunno about you guys, but the dessert line's calling my name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever ones to be outdone, Naruto and Kiba followed quickly behind him. Upon reaching the line, they grabbed one huge plate each, along with two sizable bowls that, when placed upon the platter, only took up a bout half the surface area (Kiba, of course, took an extra bowl for Akamaru.) With that taken care of, they darted about, filling the unoccupied spaces of their plates with all manner of sweets: cake, pie, donuts, jello, pudding, danishes...all of this was piled high on their plates. Once they were stacked to a reasonable height (again, about three feet tall), they immediately went over to the ice cream dispensers, filling their bowls to the brim with chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and everything in-between, then proceeded to top THAT with a truly ridiculous amount of toppings: cookie crumbs, chocolate syrup, peanut butter sauce, marshmallow topping, whipped cream, and cherries. Kiba simply got Akamaru a huge dish of ice cream with peanut butter sauce and whipped cream; he didn't want to add anything else, for fear of making him sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlates loaded up as such, they lugged them back to the table, plopping them on top of it. Naruto and Hunter immediately took their seats, grabbed a spoon, and began going to town on their massive plates. Kiba, on the other hand, took Akamaru's ice cream bowl off his plate and pushed it towards the pup. \"Here ya go, buddy; enjoy.\" Akamaru, wagging his tail and barking appreciatively, struggled to his paws; his belly hung low beneath him, and just barely avoided touching the table. Disregarding this, the pup stuck his head into the ice cream, lapping it up. Laughing, Kiba hopped back into his own seat and began shoveling his own treats into his waiting maw, grabbing a spoon in the other hand and shoveling ice cream into his mouth simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The four youths continue to power through their vast dessert.  Naruto was stuffing as many donuts into his mouth as he could fit.  Kiba was chomping down various danishes at a rapid pace.  Hunter munched on several cookies at once, and little Akamaru was lapping at his giant bowl of vanilla ice cream at a neverending pace.  \"Mmmm!  This stuff is so yummy!\" exclaimed Naruto happily as he rubbed his tummy happily and resumed stuffing more and more donuts into his jaws.  Kiba, having gulped down a hefty mouthful of danish, licked his lips and nodded in agreement.  \"You said it, bone-head!  This stuff's like what you'd get outta the pastry places down the block...and nowhere near as expensive!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then proceeded to grab another danish and, before stuffing it into his mouth, grinned, and dipped it in his pudding, before taking a huge bite.  Seeing this, Hunter's face lit up as he grinned back and said, \"Nice!  Why didn't I think'uh that?\"  Wasting no time, Hunter took several cookies, dunked them all in his own bowl of pudding, and popped them right into his mouth.  Not wanting to feel left out, Naruto did the same with his donuts, and chomped away.  Akamaru was too enticed by the surplus of vanilla ice cream to even notice what the kids were doing.  <i>Boy, the guys aren't kidding!  This ice cream is yummier than most ice cream I've eaten!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids continued to mix their pastries with their pudding and stuff away, absorbing the ultra sweet flavor rushing with each bite.  As they continued for a good while however, they suddenly stopped, as the sugar finally began to circulate in their system.  In unison, the four stopped and simply gaped for a moment.  \"Whoa...\" muttered a dazed Naruto.  \"...So....much....sugar....\" replied Kiba.  Suddenly, everyone's eyes began to dilate.  Immediately, the boys and pups grinned, and frantically began scarfing more and more of their desserts at an abnormally fast rate.  Naruto crammed several donuts into his mouth so fast that they crumbled from the sides of his mouth as his cheeks bulged comically.  He'd chew quickly then with a hearty gulp, send the large bulge of pastries down his throat, and straight into his ever expanding belly.  Hunter and Kiba were on the same boat.  Rapidly chomping and gulping away at more and more pastries at an almost unstoppable pace.  Akamaru was now digging his head into the bowl and actually biting at his ice cream now, taking tiny but speedy puppy bites as more and more of his ice cream began to enter his tiny maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would occasionally stop, burp, or catch their breath, then almost immediately dive right back into their desserts at a speedy consumption rate.  The boys seemed to have plowed through each pastry variation within minutes.  After tearing through one pastry side after another, the boys and anthro-pup grabbed their pudding bowls and shoveled what remained into their mouths, before licking the bowl clean.  Naruto then proceeded to tear into a rather tall and jiggly plate of jello in a hurry.  Kiba grabbed the several slices of cake he'd placed on his tray, and got to work, tearing them down, while Hunter wasted no speedy time scarfing down one of several slices of pie he'd added to his tray.  \"C'mon!  C'mon!  Hurry it up!  We still got tons more of this stuff to eat!\" Hunter said, noticeably overexcited and overstimulated from his sugar rush.  But his words were not lost, as the others seemed to quicken their stuffing their faces, before Hunter grabbed his fork and joined them without haste...</span></div></div>",

In the meantime, their stomachs continued to swell and expand as more and more sweets were packed into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime ticked by, and the sugar rush began to fade, the four slowing a bit. However, there was still enough left for them to press on, shoveling donuts, cake, and assorted pastries into their hungry maws (or, in Akamaru's case, scarfing down the massive bowl of vanilla ice cream.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the three boys (well, two boys and one anthro-pup) leaned back in their chairs and groaned, rubbing their overstuffed tummies. As they did so, they looked at their plates; with the exception of the rather considerable bowls of ice cream they'd gotten, their plates had been picked utterly clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's eyes widened, even as he stifled a burp. \"Whoa. We---URP!---actually ate all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groaned, looking down at his stomach. \"I-I dunno. You tell me.\" Kiba and Hunter followed his advice, and their eyes subsequently widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir stomachs had swollen even more from the massive influx of sugary treats, pushing out even more in front of them. Their respective shirts had ridden up even further, and were now resting well above their navels; in fact, it wouldn't be too much longer before they were resting on top of the overstuffed spheres. In addition, their pants were beginning to feel uncomfortably tight, but none of them paid that much mind at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wow,\" Kiba finally spoke up, licking his lips. \"We sure ate a lot, didn't we?\" He smirked. \"Heh, nothing this gut can't handle!\" He gave his stomach a firm pat, inadvertently releasing a belch that caused Naruto and Hunter to giggle. \"Heh; 'scuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;i&gt;You're...you're excused...&lt;/i&gt; Akamaru yipped sluggishly, lying flat on his back next to the now-depleted bowl of ice cream. &lt;i&gt;Ooh, my tummy...&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe appendage in question, as a result of the influx of ice cream, had expanded even more. It stuck out above him, the furry appendage, spreading out and making it so that, at least from an overhead perspective, his paws could hardly be seen, even though his back legs were pushed rather far apart from one another due to the sheer size of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba raised an eyebrow, concerned. \"Uh...you OK, buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked, weakly wagging his tail. &lt;i&gt;Y-yeah, I'm fine. I shoulda expected this, really. I said I'd end up looking like a white, fluffy bowling ball, and here I am.&lt;/i&gt; The pup suddenly whined, leaning his head back down. Sympathetic, Kiba reached out and scratched the large protuberance, much to Akamaru's delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was about to speak up, but he winced as he felt the tightness in his waist. \"Oh man, my shorts feel like they're gonna give any minute now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, though he felt the tightness as well, grinned. \"Hey, that just gave me an idea!\" He gestured to the massive bowls of ice cream the three had. \"Let's start eating the ice cream, and see who busts their pants button first!\" With that in mind, he grabbed his spoon and started scooping ice cream into his mouth. Hunter and Kiba, not wanting to be left behind, did the same...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so, the three youths scarfed away at the massive bowls of ice cream bestowed upon each one.  Naruto had already taken an early lead for scarfing down before anyone else, but the race was close.  Both Hunter and Kiba were forcing themselves to shovel bite after bite down their throats, only able to briefly appreciate the flavor before gulping it down and shoveling even more.  And with each passing spoonful of ice cream consumed, their tummies continued to swell outward, pressing further and further against their shorts as it constricted their growing bellies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning confidently, Naruto maintained his lead, while the others continued shoveling bite after bite into their mouths as quickly as they could.  Suddenly, Naruto stopped mid-bite, as his eyes widened.  Suddenly, he stopped and clutched his head with both hands, leaning back and shouting, \"GAAAH!  BRAIN FREEZE!!  BRAIN FREEZE!!!\"  He whimpered pitifully as he clutched his head and thrashed around briefly, earning a chuckle from Kiba, who couldn't help but stop and add, \"Heh, didn't think ya had anything in there to freeze, bonehead.\"  Angry, Naruto glared back at Kiba, and took a deep breath, before jumping right back in and catching Kiba off guard.  However, all the while this was transpiring, Hunter hadn't stopped.  His speedy momentum; as a result, gave him the upper hand on the others, and was now leading the race to bust his pants button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter mentally chuckled to himself, as he continued to trailblaze ahead the boys.  With each bite swallowed, he could feel his belly digging deeper into the waistband of his shorts, causing the young anthro-pup immense discomfort.  Nevertheless, he soldiered on, determined to win and give the boys some extra drive in the process.  He could feel the button beginning to strain as it struggled to maintain his growing midsection.  Naruto and Kiba saw this as well, and opted to speed up as fast as they could before that button gave.  Catching this, Hunter smirked and sped up as well, despite an immense discomfort and cramped feeling overwhelming his expanding stomach.  <i>C'mon...j-just...a little....more....</i> Hunter thought, shoveling as much ice cream as he could down his mouth as fast as he could, until finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's belly finally surged outward as the button to his shorts fired right off his pants and headed right for Kiba's unexpecting face, but luckily Naruto caught it before it could nail the dog-nin.  \"Whoa...t-that was close...\" Kiba sighed with relief and looked at Naruto appreciatively.  \"Uhh...t-thanks, man.\"  Naruto smiled and said, \"Don't mention it, dog breath!\"  The two chuckled amongst themselves as Hunter sighed with relief as he then rested his paw against his furry tummy happily.  \"Ahhh, MUCH better!\" he said with glee.  He then glanced curiously at the boys and asked, \"Errr....did I miss something?\"  Naruto held his button up.  \"Ya almost cracked dog breath in the dome with this thing,\" he said with a smirk, causing the wolf-pup to rub the back of his head sheepishly as he chuckled with embarrassment.  \"Right....ehhh, sorry about that, Kiba.\"  Kiba laughed and said, \"Don't sweat it.  Just be sure to duck when my button goes...\" he added with an impish grin, causing Hunter to gulp nervously, before turning his attention to his ice cream.  \"Still, you DID manage to beat us, and that ain't something a lotta people can do.  Soooo...nice job, Hunter!\"  Hunter smiled appreciatively and said, \"Thanks!\" before he accidentally let out a huge belch, causing him to blush a bit as the boys laughed heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one!\" cheered Naruto, Hunter chuckled a bit wearily and said, \"Heh...s'cuse me.  But if you guys don't mind, I think I need a breather...eating all that ice cream at once kinda left me winded...\"  Naruto smirked, then turned his attention back to his ice cream, and Kiba.  \"So?  How about it, dog breath?  While he's taking his break, ya wanna see which one of us can pop his button next?\"  Kiba grinned and said, \"Oh, you're still goin' down, Uzumaki!\"  And with that, they resumed shoveling more ice cream into their ever growing tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth maintained an even keel for a good while, with neither side willing to go down, but in the end...</span></div></div>",

Utterly exhausted, the boys, pop and dog had once again collapsed in a fit of tired childlike laughter in the grass, panting heavily.  The sheer extent of their playing had caused their tummies to once again recede and deflate to the point where they had seemingly returned to their normal sizes; albeit slightly pudgy from their newfound youth.  \"Whew...now that was a blast...\" exclaimed Naruto as he giggled to himself and looked up at the sky.  Kiba nodded and said, \"Yeah, that match where I totally kicked your butt was a blast!  Wouldn'tcha say, Wolfy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he got no response.  \"Wolfy?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, both Naruto and Kiba turned to the pup to see him glancing over by a large crowd standing over what appeared to be some kind of outside reception area.  \"Huh.  Wonder what's going on over there...\" pondered Naruto.  Whiffing, Hunter's tail immediately wags as he rises to his paw feet and jesters towards the others to do the same.  \"Whatever it is, it smells delicious,\" responded Hunter finally as he licked his maw and rubbed his stomach hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them soon approached the crowd, only to see a large \"Eating Contest\" sign near a large table.  Both Naruto and Kiba went wide eyed.  \"What are the odds...\" muttered Naruto.  Kiba smirked and nudged his friend in the shoulder a bit.  \"With us?  Generally pretty good.\"  Turning to the other boys, Hunter grinned toothily and said, \"How about it, boys?  Think you're up for it?\"  As if on cue, a loud rumbling emanated from all three of their stomachs, earning a few sheepish chuckles.  \"Hehe, guess playtime DID kinda make me pretty hungry...\" said Naruto as he rubbed the back of his head with a sheepish grin across his face.  Smirking, Kiba nodded and said, \"Man, I could eat a horse or two after all that.\"  The two then walked besides Hunter and approached the contest receptionist, and with an eager smile, said, \"Hiya!  Do you think me and my friends could enter-\"<br>\r\n\"D'awwwww!  Why aren't you the cutest little thing I've ever seen!\" said the receptionist as he ruffled the top of Hunter's little head like one would a puppy.  Both Naruto and Kiba snickered amongst themselves while Hunter did his best not to scowl in annoyance.  \"Right....anyway, could the three of us enter this eating contest?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I dunno, little fella.  You sure you and your friends have the tummies for it?\" asked the receptionist as he playfully poked Hunter once in the stomach, once again causing the others to laugh, much to his bemusement.  \"...I think we'll manage...\" grumbled Hunter, clearly annoyed.<br>\r\n\"So what're the rules anyhow?\" asked Kiba.<br>\r\n\"It's simple really,\" started the receptionist, \"we bring out a massive platter of certain foods or drinks, and if you can eat everything on each platter, you win.\"<br>\r\n\"What do we win exactly?\" asked Naruto.<br>\r\n\"Well, this contest is being sponsored by Ichiraku's. Sooooo if you boys can pull it off, you'll each get all the Ichiraku's you can eat free for one week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if time had just stopped, all three gaped in utter astonishment at what they had just heard, especially Naruto, whom; after a moment of wide eyed silence, finally managed to say, \"F-f-free for a week...?  Free Ichiraku's...?\"  To which the receptionist nodded and said, \"If you're entering as a team, there's two ways you can compete.  All three of you tackling each platter in a larger size at once, or you can rotate between platters.  I'll let you kids decide that for yourselves while we get this thing going.  Good luck!\"  He then headed back to the main table, leaving the three to decide how they wanted to approach this golden opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some careful consideration, ultimately, they decided to...</span></div></div>",

I'm starving...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked jovially, wagging his tail. It suddenly came to a stop, though, when a thought occurred to him. <i>Wait a minute,</i> he ruffed, <i>even if you win this contest, that stuff you guys drank will only last until tomorrow, right? If you win as kids but go to cash in on your prize at your actual ages, will they even let ya do it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's eyes widened, and he glanced at Akamaru. \"Never thought of it like that, boy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned. \"Not to worry, guys,\" he said confidently. \"I've got quite a few more bottles of that wonderful little juice; worst comes to worst, we can just down another round and avoid any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Naruto and Kiba's eyes lit up at this. \"Really?!\" Naruto exclaimed. \"That's awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Well, I do have the rest of the week off; I guess I can go for that.\" He giggled suddenly as Akamaru nuzzled him. He didn't know why, but upon hearing that Kiba would be staying like this a little longer, the dog had felt an inexplicable surge of joy in his chest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, boys, everything's set up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of the attendant's voice, the three prospective contestants, with Akamaru in tow, grinned and dashed towards the table, Hunter running on all fours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they screeched to a stop in front of the man, he chuckled. \"Eager, aren't you?\" He indicated the table. \"Well, have you boys decided what you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Naruto piped up. \"We're gonna rotate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded. \"Sounds good!\" He pulled a chair away from the table and motioned towards it. \"So, which one of you would like to go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends,\" Kiba answered. \"What's the first course?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled, gesturing to a large plate being brought out by some of the other attendants. \"Why don't you see for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, the aroma coming off of it was absolutely delectable, and it even made Hunter and Kiba's mouths water, owing to their enhanced sense of smell. As it was set down, the three could see that it was....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both Hunter and Kiba's eyes widened with absolute ecstasy.  The first course waiting to be consumed was a pile of large, fresh off the grill burgers of all kinds.  The young boy and pup were practically drooling at the sight.  After a moment, Akamaru barked, getting their attention.  <i>So are you guys gonna just stand there drooling all day or are you gonna actually eat those burgers?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought immediately broke their trance, as both Kiba and Hunter shared a brief glance, both knowing the other wanted in.  Kiba was about a step away from mauling all the burgers he could handle, but he stopped for a moment and turned back to Hunter, then back the burgers, and with a disgruntled roll of his eyes, his head dropped as he said, \"Ah, go ahead, W-I mean Hunter.\"  Hunter's face lit up as his tail started to wag.  \"Really?  You sure?\" asked the wolf pup.  Kiba shrugged and said, \"Ah, ya look like you really want to take this round, plus, I mean the whole reason we're out here having fun in the first place was because of you, right?  So I figure you should probably get first dibs.  Besides,\" Kiba muttered under his breath, not wanting to continue aloud as he rubbed the back of his head, \"I guess I was being kind of a jerk to you, and you've been pretty cool so far.  Sooooo, yeah.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Hunter nodded and said, \"Thanks, pal!\" and sat right on down while Kiba huffed and stood a bit disgruntled besides Naruto who smirked and nudged the dog-nin in the shoulder as he said, \"Pffft, ya big softy.\"<br>\r\n\"Zip it before I tenderize ya, bone-head!\" responded Kiba in annoyance, much to Naruto's amusement.  Akamaru licked the young Kiba's face and lightened him up a bit as he ruffled the dog's head and said, \"Let's just hope he doesn't screw up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's gonna be a problem...\" responded Naruto with a laugh as he pointed towards Hunter's direction.  Much to Kiba's surprise, the wolf-pup was already scarfing down those massive burgers voraciously.  The juicy tender beef combined with the various sauces and condiments sent a whirlwind of flavor to Hunter's tongue as he hungrily consumed more and more burgers at a surprisingly rapid pace.  Even the man who set up the competition was watching Hunter's speedy consumption in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every bit of burger devoured, Hunter's stomach began to push outward a bit, ever so slightly distending further and further with every burger consumed.  \"Man, look at him go...must be some tasty burgers...\" uttered Naruto.  Kiba, however, could still smell the delicious beef from where he stood, then folded his arms and pouted a bit.  \"Being nice sucks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking some beef residue from his maw, Hunter opened wide and stuffed a BBQ sauce laden burger straight into his jaws, taking a huge bite and practically biting a complete third of the burger in one go.  The grilled and fried onion strips combined with the dripping sauce made for one of the tastier burgers as Hunter stopped for a moment and savored the pure flavor resonating as he chewed happily on the massive burger bite.  Finally, the wolf took a huge gulp and sent the contents of his mouth down his throat and into his now slightly ballooned out belly, still concealed beneath his tanktop, but very noticeably rounded out from all the burgers.  Hunter exhaled heartily then stopped for a moment and thumped his fist paw into his chest a few times, forcing out a loud belch, before sighing happily and getting back to work on the burgers.  Taking bigger bites than before in order to finish a little faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kiba and Akamaru watched for a few more moments until finally, Hunter had finally finished the last sizable burger on his plate, leaning back in his chair and resting his paws on his bloated belly, still completely sealed beneath his shirt, but just barely.  The man smiled as he held the pup's arm up and said, \"Great job, little fella!  Now, onto the next course!\"  Smiling, Hunter hoisted himself from the chair and joined the others, one paw still massaging his strained gut.  \"So, how were the burgers?\"  asked Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping loudly, Hunter giggled and said, \"Tasty,\" as he patted his belly happily.  Kiba simply grumbled under his breathe.  \"Thanks a lot for letting me have at that one, by the way!\"  Kiba's annoyed expression lightened as he smirked a bit and said, \"Yeah, whatever.\"<br>\r\n\"I just wonder what the next course is gonna be,\" said Naruto as he scratched his blond head curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the man brought out the next dishes for the second course...</span></div></div>",

Rubbing his hands together and running his tongue over his lips once again, he picked up the first rib, opened wide, and took a huge bite out of it. His eyes lit up as the meat practically slid off the bone, and the tangy-sweet flavor of the sauce mixed with the moist tenderness of the meat hit his tongue.  Swallowing, he held the bone away from his mouth, which was already ringed with sauce. \"Oh wow, these are really good!\" Kiba exclaimed, licking some of the sauce off before taking another huge bite out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked, folding his arms behind his head. \"Heh, let's hope he does as good as you did, Hunter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Hunter replied absentmindedly, watching as Kiba finished off his first rib and immediately started on the second one. \"Oh man, those look amazing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Naruto raised an eyebrow. \"If ya really wanted them that much, why didn't ya just take it? I mean, I know we're rotating, but still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged, managing to tear his gaze away for a moment to look at Naruto. \"Well, Kiba let me tackle the burgers even though he obviously wanted them, so I figured it was only fair I let him take this round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tilted his head. \"Yeah, I guess that makes sense.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru said nothing, only watching in amazement as Kiba quickly polished off his second rib, then got to work on his third. Then his fourth, fifth, sixth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Kiba's stomach had started to round out a bit under his shirt, the article of clothing already splattered with drops of sauce. Not deterred by this in the slightest, Kiba continued ripping the meat off the bone, at this point finishing each one off in only one or two gigantic bites; owing to how tender the ribs were, he only had to chew each bite slightly before gulping it down, allowing him to keep a good pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes ticked by, the pile of ribs on the plate began to shrink, being swiftly replaced by an ever-growing pile of bones. Conversely, his tummy began bulging out further, pushing out and further pressing against his v-necked shirt, the bottom of the doggie face becoming somewhat distorted. Meanwhile, Hunter, Naruto, and Akamaru all watched, enraptured, as Kiba tore through the remaining ribs, his belly ballooning slightly with each rib devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the last bone had been dropped on the plate, and Kiba burped and leaned back in his seat, letting one arm hang to the side while the other massaged his tummy. At this point, it was roughly the same size as Hunter's; rounded and bulging out noticeably, but (barely) managing to stay completely under his shirt. However, the bottom of his doggie face was starting to get a little bit scrunched up. Walking over to the little dog-nin, the attendant took hold of the arm that was dangling and held it up in the air. \"Wow, great job, kiddo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Kiba exclaimed, grinning and licking his lips in an attempt to get some of the sauce up. The attendant released his arm, and Kiba hopped up off his chair and strode back towards his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked, licking his face (and privately savoring the sauce that had been left on it). <i>Great job, Kiba!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba giggled, ruffling Akamaru's head. \"Thanks, boy!\" He burped again. \"I still got lots of room left, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter massaged his own tummy. \"Heh, so do I!\" He turned to Naruto, smirking playfully. \"What about you, Naruto? You think you can keep up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked back. \"Heh, bring it on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the next course had been set out on the table, and it was...</span></div></div>",

I thought this was an EATING contest, not a drinking contest!\"  Kiba simply shrugged, still massaging his swollen stomach, while Hunter did the same.  \"Awww, come on, that's not fair!  You guys get to eat foods you wanted, and I get stuck with a buncha soda?!\"<br>\r\n\"You like soda though,\" responded Kiba.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but how come it couldn't be something like Ramen?  Like, a LOT of Ramen?!\" pouted Naruto, to which Hunter smirked and said, \"Well, look at the bigger picture here.  Do well here, and you can have all the Ramen you can slurp down for a week straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused Naruto to reel back a little bit from his disappointment.  \"Besides, you did great in our soda chugging contest yesterday.  We need whoever's best at each course to tackle them if we're gonna win.\"  said Hunter, raising another valid point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, alright.  Fine.  For Ichiraku's!\" Naruto exclaimed proudly, before turning to the other two, and with a sly grin, following up with, \"and because considering how full you two look, that much soda'd probably make you explode,\" and with that, Naruto finally charged towards the table and plopped himself onto the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting absolutely no time, he grabbed the first pitcher and immediately began chugging it down vigorously.  Kiba and Hunter watched in awe as the carbonated liquid began to quickly deplete from the pitcher and down Naruto's throat with amazingly speedy and hearty gulps.  To both their surprise, the pitcher had already reached the half way point, and somehow, Naruto was still chugging it down without any stops.  Seems his temporary state of youth not only increased his appetite, but the extra boast of energy allowed him to chug for an even more extended period of time than he'd usually go before needing to take a breath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter simply watched, little tail wagging as Naruto kept going and going and going.  With so much of the carbonated beverage being consumed at once, Naruto's tummy began to expand outward slightly with each hearty gulp.  Even Kiba couldn't help but be a bit impressed with his speed.<br>\r\n\"Oh, man, look at him go...\" muttered Kiba in awe.<br>\r\n<i>Oh boy...he better pace himself, otherwise, he might make himself sick...</i> thought Akamaru cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after somehow depleting his first pitcher of cola in one go, Naruto slammed the pitcher onto the table proudly, before wincing and clutching his stomach.  <i>See?  I told you he'd make himself sick if he didn't-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's concerns were promptly and disgustingly disrupted as Naruto released a booming and lengthy belch which lasted a few short but rather audible seconds, earning some hearty laughter from both Kiba and Hunter respectively while Akamaru's ears simply dropped in embarrassment.  \"Whew, much better!\" said Naruto as he sighed with relief and patted his belly proudly before getting to work on his next pitcher.  <br>\r\n<i>Nevermind...</i> thought Akamaru as he resumed watching Naruto chug away along with the other two.  Still with quite a few pitchers left to chug down, but thus far, his momentum hadn't faltered as the fizzy drink continued to pour into and expand his belly with each massive heap gulped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Ichiraku's is as good as ours,\" muttered Hunter as he rubbed his hand-paws together eagerly.<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" muttered Kiba as he rubbed his stomach hungrily, \"I just hope the bonehead can keep this pace up.\"</span></div></div>",

Kiba, Hunter, and Akamaru all watched, awestruck, as the bubbly liquid flowed down Naruto's throat and into his belly, the appendage slowly ballooning outwards as more and more of the cola flowed into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Naruto polished it off, plunked it down next to the other two, and let loose with another titanic belch. Giving his belly a few more hearty pats, he quickly seized the fourth pitcher and began chugging it down, just as he had the three before. He made it about halfway through the pitcher before he had to lower it, letting out yet another loud belch before jumping back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, lookit him go...\" Hunter muttered in awe. \"He must really want that Ichiraku's...\" he rubbed his own swollen tummy. \"Not that I blame him...\" Kiba, finding his gaze fixed on Naruto, only nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the fourth pitcher was completely depleted, and Naruto immediately grabbed the fifth, pouring more of the cola down his throat. His tummy continued to expand, almost like water being poured into a balloon, pushing out under his hoodie and continuing to bulge with every gulp he took. Soon, even that pitcher joined the other four. Then a sixth, a seventh, an eighth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after several minutes, Naruto had depleted the twelfth, final pitcher of soda, slamming it down next to the previous eleven. He sighed, leaned back in his chair, and shook his now-distended midsection with both hands, giggling at the sloshing sensations he got from it. Like Hunter and Kiba before him, his stomach was now quite round, sticking out and barely managing to stay under his orange hoodie. The attendant, amazed, walked over to Naruto and lifted his arm in the air. \"Great job, kiddo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, grinning, opened his mouth to reply, but a massive belch escaped instead. The boy blushed, giggling sheepishly. The attendant, thankfully, took it in stride. \"You said it, kid!\" Letting Naruto's arm fall, he walked off, presumably to grab the next course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took this opportunity to hop off the seat, cradling his belly with both hands and continuing to shake it and let it slosh even as he walked back towards Kiba, Hunter, and Akamaru. As Naruto approached them, Hunter grinned, jogged up to him, and gave him a congratulatory pat on the back. \"Way to go, Naruto! You did great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto beamed. \"Thanks!\" He exclaimed. \"At this rate, we'll win that free week of Ichiraku's no problem!\" At this, he smirked at the two. \"Still, you guys look pretty full; ya think you can keep up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scoffed. \"Keep up with you? No problem; I haven't even gotten started!\"  He licked his lips, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTail wagging, Hunter looked at Kiba. \"You and me both; I ain't done yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru sighed. <i>Maybe not, but by the time you guys <b>are</b> done, I'll probably be stuck rolling you  back to the inn...</i> Unfortunately for Akamaru, instead of making them reconsider, it only made them giggle. Whining, Akamaru let his ears droop; he really hoped none of them would make themselves sick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the next platter was brought out, and it was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wagging his tail eagerly, Hunter turned to the others and asked, \"Hey, do you guys mind if I try this one?\"  Naruto shrugged and said, \"Ugh, it's all yours.  I'm still kinda full from all that soda...\" as if to emphasize his point, a sudden burp erupted from his mouth as he giggled wearily and rested both hands atop his bloated belly, continuing to enjoy the surprising fullness and sloshiness.  Kiba on the other hand, raised an eyebrow and asked, \"Those are a LOT of cupcakes, Hunter.  You sure you can manage it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hunter could respond, his bloated tummy let out an audibly hungry growling.  Kiba's arms dropped to his sides as he said, \"Guess that's a yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling toothily, Hunter immediately pranced for the table and sat before the massive pile of cupcakes.  Taking a brief moment to just appreciate the sheer amount of different flavored treats that awaited him, Hunter licked his maw and proceeded to immediately stuff an entire chocolate cupcake with sprinkles into his more than eager mouth, luckily none of them still had the wrappers on the bottom.  Chewing heartily, Hunter smiled, enjoying the immensely sweet chocolaty flavor of the frosting and the immensely moist cupcake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon gulping it down, Hunter grinned and proceeded to grab two more cupcakes with both hand-paws.  With one, he licked the frosting clean off in just two licks, and popped the now bare cupcake into his mouth, before stuffing the second vanilla cupcake into his open maw at the same time.  He only took a few toothy moments to chew both cupcakes as his cheeks had inflated a bit to accommodate the space in his mouth being occupied before gulping them both down in one hearty gulp.  Leaning in his chair, he sighed heartily as he patted his growing belly proudly, enjoying the sweet sugary taste in his mouth.  Shortly after, he proceeded to stuff as many cupcakes as he could into his mouth at once, and began chewing at a much more rapid pace than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba watched as Hunter seemed to turn into an eating machine.  Cramming cupcake after cupcake into his mouth and only chewing on it for what seemed like no more than a few seconds before proceeding to gulp sometimes three or four at a time down his throat and into his gullet.  \"Boy, that wolf sure can pack 'em in, can't he?\" said Naruto as he watched the wolf pup continue to rapidly put away several cupcakes at once like nothing.  Kiba examined the young pup's rounded tummy, and saw that a sliver of fur had begun to poke out from the bottom of his tanktop, as his belly began to push outward more and more and more with each passing mouthful the wolf would gulp down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, that mountain of cupcakes was starting to shrink more and more, as the treats were being stuffed right into his awaiting maw and promptly gulped into his belly in one sudden gluttonous display.  Akamaru took notice of Hunter's ballooned out belly, watching is continue to make his shirt rise up and expose more of his furry belly as it continued to inflate more and more.  <i>I don't think I've ever seen someone stuff that many CUPCAKES into their stomach at once...</i><br>\r\n\"You said it, boy...\" replied Kiba, still in awe besides Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent job, kiddo!\" cheered the attendant as he rose Hunter's weary arm in the air and cheered happily for him, causing his even larger belly to jostle and jiggle a bit, earning a sudden but audible belch from the wolf as he smirked and smacked his lips.  Rising up from his chair, he slowly approached the others.  His now vastly bloated and noticeably bare belly had pushed outward a considerable amount with even more of his bare stomach, right below his belly button, now exposed as he absent mindedly rubbed across his aching stomach with both hands.  \"Nice job, Hunter!  I knew you could pull it off!\" cheered Naruto happily as he playfully nudged him in the shoulder, earning a smile from the young pup as he said, \"Hehe, thanks!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, great job up there.  Seeing you put away so many cupcakes at once was awesome to see,\" congratulated Kiba while Hunter smiled back and said, \"Thanks!\" and after stifling a softer burp, continued to say with a childish grin, \"and REALLY filling...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I just hope you guys don't get too confident and end up overdoing it early, because it doesn't look like any of you are gonna be off the hook anytime soon...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words of warning from Akamaru, the trio glanced back as the next platter was being assigned to the table.

To that end, Kiba picked up an enormous handful of jerky in each hand, ripped off roughly half of each handful with his teeth, and chewed for a good few seconds, savoring the flavors of the various jerkies. After chewing for a little bit more, he crammed the remainder of each handful into his mouth, his cheeks bulging out slightly as he chewed the second mouthful. After a little bit, he finally gulped everything down, sighed, licked his lips, and picked up another two massive handfuls and began repeating the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Hunter, and Akamaru watched, intrigued. \"Huh, he's not rushing it; guess he took your advice, Akamaru,\" Hunter muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant dog shrugged. <i>Eh, well, jerky's pretty chewy, so there isn't really any other way he could eat it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinked, looking up at Akamaru. \"Huh, guess that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, meanwhile, stole a glance at Hunter's brown-furred tummy, sticking out from under his tank top and only just managing to cover his navel. Looking from side to side shiftily, Naruto maneuvered his hand over to the sphere of furry flesh and began scratching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, feeling this sensation, glanced at Naruto. \"Naruto, what're you...\" he trailed off as his eyes shut halfway, and a goofy grin appeared on his muzzle. His tail began wagging, and one of his feet-paws began thumping up and down. \"Ooh, yeah, that feels really really nice....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto giggled. \"Heh; guess ya like having your tummy scratched, huh, Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup glared at Naruto, but even this melted once again under the pleasurable sensation of having his partially-exposed tummy scratched. Even so, he kept his eyes on Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently, Kiba had gotten impatient with his intial method of eating the jerky, as he was now cramming as many pieces of jerky as he could into his mouth at a time, his cheeks bulging out much as Hunter's had. Then, when his mouth reached his limit, he slowly chewed the dried meats, grinning and savoring the myriad flavors that danced across his tongue. Finally, when he'd chewed enough, he gulped the whole thing down, the sheer quantity causing his stomach to bulge out slightly, even as he panted for breath. It didn't take him long, though, before he recomposed himself and resumed cramming jerky into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe repeated this over and over: he would cram the jerky into his mouth, chew it, swallow it, and his stomach would once again bulge out. Cram, chew, swallow, bulge, cram, chew, swallow, bulge... In the process, the bottom of the cartoony dog face on his shirt was becoming further distorted, pushing out further as his stomach strained the fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, around his fourth or fifth swallow, his shirt had ridden up slightly to reveal a small sliver of flesh. Undeterred, Kiba kept it up. Cram, chew swallow, bulge, cram, chew, swallow, bulge....With every swallow, his stomach pushed out more, and the bottom of his shirt continued its slow journey upwards, exposing more and more skin as it did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Kiba picked up his now-empty plate, licking it clean before letting it clatter back to the table. Sighing happily, he leaned back in his chair and rubbed his belly. It had swollen even further from the massive influx of jerky, ballooning out noticeably. His tummy, like Hunter's, now exposed a decent amount of bare flesh; however, unlike the young pup's,  Kiba's v-neck shirt had ridden up just far enough to show his navel showing for the whole world to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the contest attendant strode over to the young boy and liftefted his arm up in the air, congratulating him. \"Great job! You three have got a heck of an appetite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked, licking his lips. \"Heh, thanks!\" Giggling, he hopped off the chair and made his way back towards Hunter and Naruto, massaging his tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. \"Heh, not bad, Kiba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter wagged his tail happily. \"Yeah, you did really good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed, rubbing his stomach with one hand while rubbing the back of his head with the other one. \"I guess I did, didn't I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, in spite of himself, barked and licked Kiba's face. <i>Well, your stomach's even bigger, and your belly-button's peeking out; you tell me.</i> Kiba blushed a bit at this, but nevertheless laughed joyously and hugged Akamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at this, Hunter turned towards Naruto. \"So, Naruto, are ya rested up enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto let out another belch before replying. \"Yeah, I think so.\" His nose wrinkled distastefully. \"Just so long as its not another round of drinks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Naruto, the next course was quickly brought out, and it was, in fact, food. More specifically, it was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, Naruto stopped as a familiar aroma wafted up his nostrils.  Taking a whiff, his attention immediately turned towards the table.  \"Is that...?\"  Watching the attendant step aside after placing down the newest entry; what looked like about 20 little steaming bowls, Naruto went wide eyed for a moment then like a rapid dog, immediately pranced towards the table, much to the amusement of Hunter and Kiba.  Staring down the multiple stacks of cups, Naruto's mouth began to water.  \"Ichiraku's....\" he muttered in a trance-like state, practically drooling like a mutt at this point.  Hunter smiled, knowing full well where this was going.  <i>Ho hooo boy, this is gonna be epic....</i> he thought as he rubbed his hand paws together eager to see where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I just hope he doesn't accidentally smack his face with a bowl again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba snickered upon remembering that.  And in that instant, Naruto was off.  He hoisted the first bowl to his mouth and as if he were moving in fast forward, he proceeded to slurp down the noodles at an irregularly speedy pace as his chopsticks almost seemed to become a blur passing the broth soaked noodles from the bowl to his all-too-eager maw.  As his cheeks began to bulge comically, Naruto took a huge hearty gulp, sending the bulge down his throat and straight into his ever-distending belly.  Within no time whatsoever, he'd drained his first bowl of what little broth remained, and immediately dove for the next.  Pouring it into his mouth like one would a cup of soup, a mix of the noodles and the broth began to pour into his mouth with him using his chopsticks to assist the stubborn noodles into his jaws.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching from afar, Hunter's tail wagged happily as he noticed Naruto's increasingly bloated tummy continuing to gradually distend with each passing mouthful of noodles and broth gulped down.  As Naruto kept the momentum going for a good while, Hunter noticed a sliver of the boy's flesh peaking out from the bottom of his hoodie while his stomach continued to inflate like a balloon.  All the while, the stack of empty bowls began to grow taller and taller.  \"You know?  In all the places I've traveled, I don't think I've ever seen anyone as excited for ramen as Naruto,\" noted Hunter as he watched the boy continue to inhale his noodles.  Kiba simply nodded and shrugged as he said, \"Yep.  That's bone-head for ya.  For as long as I've known him, he's always loved the stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And he's always far too eager to show just how much more of it he can stuff into his stomach than anyone around him...</i> noted Akamaru, earning a scoff from Kiba while Hunter merely chuckled.  \"All I know is, he certainly seems to enjoy the stuff!\" responded Hunter, still incredibly fixated on Naruto's monumentally speedy consumption.  \"If this were a ramen eating contest, we'd have already won our free week with him alone at this rate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Naruto was already on his 15th bowl of ramen, with absolutely no sign of slowing down.  As he continued to slurp down his newest bowl, his belly had distended outward to the point where his shirt had ridden up to peaking below the boy's belly-button.  But still, despite his stomach seeming to have already expanded beyond capacity, he just kept slurping down those noodles as though there were no tomorrow, and all with a big happy grin on his face as he enjoyed the wonderfully steamy flavor with each passing bowl consumed and how each one made his belly feel nice and warm with so many fresh noodles being deposited into his stomach at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finishing his 15th bowl, Naruto had to stop for a breather as he leaned back in his chair, groaning a bit from strain and the rest in utter bliss as he rested both hands atop his impressively distended gut.  \"How you feeling, Naruto?\" asked Hunter.  Burping loudly, Naruto sighed and held his thumb up then said, \"Ahhh, I feel a LOT better now!\" then proceeded to immediately begin slurping down bowl number 16.  His pace had slowed down a considerable amount than his previous bowls due to the added fullness he was starting to feel.  Thankfully, the sheer burst of flavor that came with every bowl of ramen he'd ever eaten was more than enough to keep him going.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more time went on, Naruto successfully managed to slurp down bowl 16, 17, 18, and 19.  Taking that final bowl up near his face, Naruto savored the moment as he proceeded to take his chopsticks and scarf down that last batch of noodles until his bowl was noodle-free.  He then proceeded to bring the bowl towards his lips and leaned his head back as he slurped down the savory broth until his bowl was bone dry.  Placing the final bowl upon his stack, Naruto smacked his lips and patted his belly proudly as the attendant; like with the others, approached and congratulated him on his victory.  \"Wow, excellent job, kid!  I don't think there's many people out there who could put away 20 cups of Ichiraku Ramen; let ALONE a child!\"  Smiling, Naruto thanked the man and approached the others happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job, Naruto!\" congratulated Hunter.  \"Honestly, for a while there, I almost didn't think you'd make it,\" noted Kiba, admittedly impressed himself.  Burping softly, Naruto smiled and gave his bloated belly a hearty slap.  \"Yeah, well, when it comes to Ichiraku's, there's no way I'm NOT gonna finish!\" responded Naruto proudly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, boys!  Onto our final wave of the competition!  Only three more platters to go.  If you three can pull it off, then get ready for all the Ichiraku's you can eat for the next week!\" addressed the attendant as he went back to get the next platter.  \"Alright, you heard the guy, it's do or die time!\" responded Naruto as he clenched his fists together and grinned excitedly.  Much to Hunter's surprise, it seems Naruto's recent round of consumption had managed to make his belly even larger than Kiba's or his own.  Playfully, Hunter poked Naruto's rounded gut and asked, \"That last round sure had an impact, didn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Naruto pointed towards Hunter and Kiba's own stomachs and said, \"Didn't think I'd catch up to you guys, honestly.  But we can't let that stop us when we're so close, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Damn right!' cheered Kiba determined.<br>\r\n\"What he said!\" responded Hunter in an equally determined voice.  Akamaru's ears dropped as he shook his head, weary of what would likely ensue when all this was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Remind me to bring a wheel barrel next time we go out...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the attendant returned with the third to last platter.  \"I should warn you guys, the servings for these last couple of rounds are gonna be a bit larger than you've endured thus far.  So just a heads up.\"  As he stepped away, the three bloated youths glanced to see what was in store for the next round...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto, Kiba, Hunter, and Akamaru all gaped as the next course was brought out and set upon the table. It was, in short, probably the single biggest steak any of them had ever seen; thick, and at least 72 ounces in size, it hung off the sides of the plate on which it had been brought on, itself a considerable size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...wow,\" Hunter finally said. \"that's, uh...that's a really big steak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Naruto mumbled, eyes wide open. \"A lot bigger than the ones we had yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba didn't say anything, his mouth wide open, his eyes as big as saucers. Akamaru, gaping it it as well, supplied his own two cents:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You have <b>got</b> to be kidding me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three children slowly turned to look at each other. \"So, uh,\" Hunter started, scratching his strained tummy. \"Who, uh, who wants to take this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winced, rubbing his own stomach. \"Eh, not me; I still gotta rest up a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sighed, looking regretful. \"I'd love to, but I need a few more minutes before I tackle anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter groaned. \"Well, I guess I'm up, then....\" Wincing, he slowly made his way back to the chair, hoisting himself up onto the seat and looking at the steak with a great deal of trepidation. It had nothing to do with the fact that it looked unappetizing; on the contrary, the steak glistened with juices, and the aromas wafting up off it set his mouth watering. Still, he was so full...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No,</i> Hunter thought, gulping. <i>I've come this far, I ain't backin' down now. Besides, if I get through this, that'll be all the free Ichiraku's we can cram into our guts for a week!</i> Steeling himself, he picked up the fork and knife that had been provided for him and began cutting off a piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba winced. \"Good luck, man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. \"Yeah, if you get through this, we get that much closer to winning some free Ichiraku's!\" Kiba glanced at him and rolled his eyes, but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly bolstered by this encouragement, Hunter finished cutting his first piece of steak and popped it into his mouth, chewing carefully. The juice and the meat-incredibly tender and flavored to perfection with a variety of spices-made his tail wag, but he was once again reminded of how full his tummy was. He chewed a bit more slowly and gulped it down, setting his utensils down and massaging his partially-exposed midsection. <i>Oh man... I keep going like that, and there's no way I'm getting through this!</i> He grimaced as he tried to think of a way to get through this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kiba, and Akamaru watched, looking on with a mixture of concern and anxiousness. \"C'mon, Hunter, don't give up now!\" Naruto shouted, clenching his fists together. \"You've been doing awesome so far!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Kiba added. \"You really gonna let this bonehead show you up?\" Naruto nodded, grinning fiercely, before he registered what Kiba said and angrily slugged his friend in the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of the situation, Hunter giggled. <i>Heh, yeah, I'm not gonna let him show me up!</i> He looked back at the steak, and as he licked his chops, an idea came to him. It was risky, but it also carried a fairly high chance of success. Sitting back up, he grabbed his fork and knife once again...but instead of cutting into the steak again, he set them to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru tilted his head. <i>Eh? What is he...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the shock of everyone present, Hunter proceeded to grab the entire, massive steak in his little hand-paws, drew it up to his face, and opened his muzzle wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba gaped. \"Is-is he really gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's muzzle snapped shut, ripping off a large part of the steak, chewing it rapidly before gulping it down. Licking the excess juice off his muzzle, he leaned back in take another bite, even as his tummy protested the extra load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kiba, and Akamaru watched in awe as Hunter continued ripping chunks off the steak and gulping them down, only allowing himself the briefest of breathers before going on. And, owing to how full his stomach already was, it didn't take long for his midsection to start showing the effects of it. With every chunk of meat that fell into his gut, the furry sphere bulged out a little bigger, putting a little more pressure on his shorts and forcing his tank top up higher and higher with every mouthful consumed. Soon, it had risen high enough that his furry navel was showing for the whole world to see, but still he did not let up, gulping down more and more of the massive steak and causing his stomach to grow bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Hunter winced as he felt a tightness in his waistline. He considered undoing his button, but knew that if he stopped for any reason, he'd risk losing his groove. <i>Ah well, not like I can't get 'em fixed...</i> To this end, he continued tearing into the steak; his stomach bulged bigger, his shirt rose higher, and his khaki shorts got tighter with every mouthful swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he'd demolished half of the massive steak; his tank top now rode a several good inches above his navel, his midsection was starting to look even more like a big furry ball, and his waistline was starting to get unbearably tight. <i>C'mon...just a little more...</i> Hunter picked up his pace, tearing off piece after piece after piece of the massive steak and gulping them down, each swallow making his shorts tighter, tighter, tighter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....until, with a determined gulp, his shorts could take no more, and the plastic disc burst free, flying off and hitting the underside of the table. Hunter blushed slightly, but never let up, continuing to tackle the remaining half of the steak, his stomach bulging bigger and his fly slowly beginning to open. Soon, the half of the steak was reduced to a quarter. Then an eighth. Then a half of an eighth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the bone of the steak clattered to the plate, completely picked clean of any meat. Groaning, Hunter slumped back in his seat, arms hanging limply to the sides. His stomach had swollen to a ridiculous proportion, his tank-top now resting completely on top of the big, furry sphere. His fly had been forced all the way open, and had anyone been standing in the right position, they'd have been able to see his boxers, emblazoned with a bunch of cartoony-looking moons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of his discomfort, Hunter smiled weakly. \"Heh...I...I did it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant, utterly shocked at the strange little fella who had demolished that monstrous steak, nonetheless made his way over and hoisted the overfilled anthro's arm in the air. \"C-congratulations, kddo! I don' think I've ever seen anyone eat that much in one sitting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter giggled weakly as the man let go of his arm, and, with a great deal of care, plopped down out of his chair; groaning and  cradling his massive tummy in his arms, he slowly lurched back to the other three., waddling a bit in his gait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. \"Awesome! Way to go, Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked good-naturedly. \"Yeah; for a minute there, I didn't think you were gonna make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled weakly. \"Th-thanks...\" Suddenly, the pup let loose with a rather queasy-sounding burp. \"Sc-scuse me, guys...I-I gotta lie down for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the warning they got before Hunter released his belly, spread his arms out to the side, and flopped onto his back, his completely bare, distended tummy sticking up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's tail wagged. <i>Eh, rest up, little fella; you've earned it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks...\" Hunter muttered, burping again. Feeling a little sorry for the wolf, Naruto walked over and began scratching his now fully-exposed belly, causing the little wolf's tail to start wagging sluggishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that all was well, the attendant gave the signal for the waiters to bring out the next dish. Soon enough, it was laid out on the table, and it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To the astonishment of Naruto and Kiba, it was a monumentally sized Triple-Decker Cake.  \"Whoa...\" was all Naruto could mutter, gaping at the sheer height of the colorful but sizable pastry.  The two glanced amongst each other a bit uncertainly.  \"Looks great...but I could a little more time to digest all that ramen,\" noted Naruto, before glancing back at Hunter, who was still flat on the floor with his engorged furry stomach sticking outward like an overly inflated balloon covered in brown fur.  \"Besides, Hunter looks like he could really use a tummy scratch right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Kiba shrugged and said, \"Ugh, fine.  I've come this far.  What's one cake gonna do?\"  He then approached the table while Naruto headed back towards Hunter and Akamaru, and continued to scratch Hunter's vastly distended tummy, causing the pup to smile weakly while his tail wagged faintly.  \"Oh man...thanks for that, Naruto.\"  Smiling, Naruto said \"Hehe, no problem!\" and playfully but absent mindedly patted the wolf pup's bloated belly, causing it to jostle a bit, making Hunter go a bit green in the gills as he covered his mouth with his paw and stifled a watery sounding burp. Stepping back, Naruto inched away a bit nervously.  \"Oops...\" was all Naruto could mutter, while Hunter groaned in pain.  \"S-sorry about that, man...\" muttered Naruto apologetically as he rubbed the back of his head sheepishly.  Weakly, Hunter smirked, doing his best not to show how uncomfortable he felt, and said, \"N-no worries....but maybe you should stick to cheering Kiba on...he's gonna need all the support he can get...*urrrp*....trust me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Naruto turned back to Kiba, who still hadn't sat down yet.  \"Hey!  What're you waiting for?!  You better not be chickening out!\" shouted Naruto.  Hunter, despite his immense fullness, could only sigh.  <i>That's ONE way of encouraging someone....</i> thought Akamaru.  \"Ugh, well, If the alternative is him playing the drums with my gut, I'll take this...\" responded Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!  I'm going already, dummy!\" snapped Kiba before plopping himself down before the giant cake and gulping nervously.  The cake was a Chocolate masterpiece with white frosting outlining each circular layer of the cake.  The top however, caught Kiba's eye.  To his surprise, there were three kids; technically two and one wolf in clothing drawn out of different colored frosting.  Above it, green frosting was used to spell out 'Good Luck, Boys!'  Kiba was taken back as he turned curiously towards the attendant.  Smiling, he shrugged innocently and said, \"Hey, it's not often you get three kids who can put away as much as you guys can.  So the bakers and cooks are all rooting for ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba couldn't help but smile, humbled by that.  Despite his fullness and the worry that he'd likely end up just like Hunter, this kind of encouragement only served to boost his desire to see this thing all the way through.  So, without wasting a second, he dug his knife into the top layer of the cake, cutting out the slice which had the frosted drawing of Naruto on top out first.  \"Who's a chicken now, bone-head?\" muttered Kiba under his breathe, before opening his mouth as wide as he could, and stuffing the slice of cake into his eager mouth.  He proceeded to push the entire slice into his mouth in one go, smearing some of the chocolate frosting on his lips as his cheeks bulged out to ridiculous proportions.  Naruto's jaw nearly dropped as he muttered, \"Holy crap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru put one paw over his face, then thought, <i>Oh this'll DEFINITELY end well...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of chewing heartily, Kiba took a massive gulp, sending the entirety of his mouthful down his throat and into his gullet.  Sighing from gulping down so much at once, Kiba took a deep breath, and proceeded to force himself to do the same thing to a larger slice from the top, smallest layer; this time, the frosted drawing of Hunter.  \"At this rate, wolfy...we'll be on the same boat...\" muttered Kiba nervously, almost talking to the slice itself before he opened wide and stuffed the whole slice into his maw like before.  As he gulped down this second slice of cake, his own belly began to gurgle violently, causing him to wince as he clutched it firmly with one hand.  \"Ugh, c'mon, just power through it.  If the wolf can do it, so can you...\" thought Kiba, determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Kiba!  Don't quit now!  You've eaten more challenging things than some cake!  You can do this no problem!\"  cheered Naruto, this time, actually getting the 'encouragement' part down.  Hearing this, Kiba nodded appreciatively then, after slicing and stuffing the piece of cake with his own drawing on it.  Proceeded to quickly cut smaller pieces and immediately haul them into his mouth, a few at a time before the entire top layer was gone.  Gulping it all down, Kiba exhaled tensely as his belly began to distend outward considerably, now exposing his belly-button and a tad bit of flesh above it.  Eating those smaller slices was causing some discomfort, but it got the job done.  \"Okay, just keep going.  Don't stop, and you'll get through it...\" he thought to himself, determined now more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe proceeded to immediately cut and stuff one slice of cake after another into his mouth, now on the second layer of the cake, which was a bit larger than the first layer.  Naruto watched with amazement and said, \"Wow, look at him go...\"  Hunter glanced back and saw the ferocity in his speed.  Chuckling, he said, \"Hope he unbuttoned his pants...\" then proceeded to once again go limp as his paws absently rubbed over his ballooned belly.  Hearing this, Akamaru whimpered...<br>\r\n<i>Oh no...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each slice of cake gulped down, Kiba's belly continued to push outward more and more, causing his shirt to ride up more and more, exposing more flesh above his navel than before.  It pushed to the point where it began to push against his pants, causing him immense discomfort, and straining his pants immensely.  Kiba winced in discomfort, but continued to press on.  \"Can't stop,\" was all he could keep thinking as he mechanically stuffed more and more cake down his throat.  He was down to the last slice from the second layer, and sure enough; as with Hunter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe button to his pants proceeded to ricochet off the table and fly into the air, causing his belly to immediately surge outward, free from containment, and expanding by a good few inches, causing Kiba to sigh with immense relief.  \"Ohhh man, that's SOOOO much better!\" he exclaimed, before immediately getting to work on the last / largest layer of the cake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little more, Dog-breathe!  You got this!\" cheered Naruto.  Despite the insult, Kiba was still encouraged to finish up.  His belly grew larger and larger with each passing slice consumed, but Kiba pressed on, determined not to quit.  Finally, he stuffed the final, largest slice into his mouth, and after a few more moments of chewing, gulped it down heartily and sighed from exhaustion, as his arms went limp to his sides and he fell back against in his chair, almost dizzy from eating so much so quick.  Astonished, the attendant gently rose the young Kiba's arm up and said, \"That was incredible, kid!  Nice job!\"  Kiba simply groaned, too exhausted to respond or pick himself up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Naruto scoffed and helped Kiba out of his seat, and walk him back towards an equally gorged Hunter and an astonished Akamaru while Kiba kept one hand atop his overly distended gut, and the other on his pants to keep them from slipping off after losing his button.  \"Wow, that was incredible, man!  How're you feeling?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's only response was a monumental and rather nasty sounding belch, before groaning and saying, \"...Full.  Very, very...full...\"  Naruto then gently eased Kiba on the ground next to Hunter, before he immediately plopped down next to the wolf pup in an immense daze; his vast and distended belly sticking up in the air, around the exact same size as Hunter's.  Seeing this, Akamaru trotted next to Kiba and licked his face, earning a weak but appreciative smile from Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, Naruto clenched his fists with determination and said, \"Welp, just one more round to go, and it's all up to me!  Time to go all out!  For Ichirak-OW!\" before he could finish, something fell out of the sky and dropped hard on his head.  Rubbing his head, Naruto bent down and examined the object.  \"Is that...the button to your pants...?\" asked Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Kiba and Hunter chuckled weakly, while Naruto sighed and turned his attention back to the table.  His eyes immediately widened with shock...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto's eyes bugged out as he saw the last course that had been placed upon the table: specifically, a gigantic bowl of ramen, easily several times bigger than his head and filled to the brim with noodles, broth, and all manner of toppings. Beside that was a huge pitcher of soda, at least a couple feet in height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped. <i>W-wow...that's a lotta food...</i> He clenched his fists. <i>B-but if I can do this, we get all the free Ichiraku's we want for a week!</i> Massaging his already swollen belly, he took a deep breath and made his way over to the table, hoisting himself himself up on the chair and slowly picking up and splitting his chopsticks in half. Gulping again, he looked back at the other two bloated children, still splayed out on the ground. \"Well, uh...wish me luck, guys.\" Hunter lifted his head off the ground and gave Naruto a weak but encouraging smile. Kiba, not even bothering, simply raised an arm up in the air and gave the blonde a thumbs-up before letting it flop back to the ground. Akamaru took a moment from looking down at the two worriedly to give Naruto an encouraging bark, his tail wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling a bit, Naruto turned back towards his food, taking a deep whiff. <i>Well, at least it smells awesome...but it's Ichiraku's, how else would it smell?</i> Bolstered by this thought, Naruto dipped his chopsticks in, picked up some ramen, and began slurping it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a feeling Naruto was going to be a while, Hunter turned his head towards Kiba, even as his paws massaged his furry tummy. \"So, Kiba, you havin' fun so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked weakly, patting his own vast gut lightly with a hand. \"Well, I am feeling a little sick right now...but yeah, it's been a lot of fun. Stuffing myself, playing...this is some of the most fun I've had in a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned, his tail wagging. \"And being a kid? How's that workin' for ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's face immediately lit up. \"It's the best! I have so much more energy, all the problems I have don't mean anything...and everything's just so much more <i>fun</i>!\" The dog-nin giggled at this, blushing as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru wagged his tail happily, licking Kiba's face. <i>Gotta admit, you're pretty damn cute when you're like this, Kiba.</i> Kiba blushed again, but nonetheless giggled as Akamaru nuzzled him. Once he was done, Kiba turned to look at Hunter. \"You said you've got more of that stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter beamed. \"Sure do! I've got enough for a whole week! Plus,\" his expression turned sly, \"a few more days besides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned widely. \"Really?! Oh man, this is gonna be great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed, before throwing a sly glance at Akamaru as well. \"And there's more than enough for you, Akamaru,\" he muttered so only the dog could hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog yelped, his eyes going wide. <i>W-well, I...uh...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden, queasy-sounding belch suddenly cut through the air, and the two bloated youths managed to lift their heads high enough off the ground to see where it was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was leaning back in his chair, wincing and rubbing his tummy with both hands. Though he hadn't even finished a quarter of the massive bowl yet, his stomach had already been affected, his hoodie rising up enough to show his navel and some skin above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's eyes widened. \"Uh-oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scowled. \"C'mon, bonehead, don't give up now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes flew open, and he glared back at Kiba. \"I wasn't giving up, dog-breath! I was just takin' a break!\" His eyes landed on the cola, and they gleamed. \"And besides, I think I just found the perfect thing to ease my tummy up a little bit...\" Licking his lips, he seized the massive pitcher; his arms struggled a little under the weight, but he managed to bring it up to his lips, the sweet, bubbly liquid flowing down his  throat and into his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Kiba breathed a sigh of relief; looked like Naruto was just getting started. Akamaru, on the other hand, whined, covering his eyes with a paw. <i>Oh man, how big is he gonna be by the time he gets done?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto continued to take a good few hearty gulps of cola, but much to Hunter and Kiba's surprise, that didn't so much as put a dent into such a massive pitcher, for as Naruto placed it back down and gasped for breathe, it still looked as if it hadn't even been touched yet, minus maybe a bit off the top now lowered ever so slightly.  \"Oh boy, I gotta feeling Naruto's not gonna be feeling all too hot by the time he's done with that thing...\" noted Hunter as he continued to massage his own aching tummy.  \"So?  Does your stomach at least feel at ease now?\" asked Kiba, still doing his best to ease his own.  But Naruto didn't respond, instead a strained look grew over his face as he clutched his distended belly firmly with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BRRAAAAAAAP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's mouth flung open as he let free a deep, resounding belch for a few seconds straight, much to the amusement of Hunter and Kiba.  Akamaru sighed and thought, <i>I'll take that as a yes...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with relief, Naruto gave his belly a hearty slap.  \"Ahhh, very much so,\" he said in response to Kiba's question and proceeded to resume getting back to work on the ramen.  Naruto continued to slurp down big heaping mouthfuls of noodles at once, causing his cheeks to bulge out comically as he chewed, savoring the delicious flavor despite his fullness, then proceeded to gulp it all down in one hearty gulp.  Hunter and Kiba watched as this pattern continued for a good while, with Naruto slurping up ample amounts of ramen, chewing then gulping before going back for more like clockwork.  With every few gulps, Nartuo's already distended tummy continued to expand further and further, causing his hoodie to ride up a little bit more, exposing more flesh above the boy's belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope the bone-head can pull it off...\" noted Kiba, seeing that Naruto's bowl had depleted past the half way point.  Confident in Naruto's abilities, Hunter smirked a bit; albeit groggily, and said, \"Yesterday night when we had our own massive bowls of ramen, I asked the same thing, and he told me that when it comes to Ichiraku's, he NEVER leaves a bowl unfinished.  Sure enough, he plowed through that massive steamy bowl like it were fun-sized.\"<br>\r\n\"Fun-sized?\" asked Kiba quizzically.<br>\r\n\"...Really small.  Point being, he was true to his word and gulped it down without hesitation.  And considering the reward, I got no doubt in my mind that he'll do the same thing here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba chuckled a bit.  \"Guess that knucklehead's ramen obsession for all these years'll finally pay off.\"  said Kiba, before glancing back and seeing Naruto leaning back to massaging his aching tummy.  \"...Hopefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping softly and rubbing his immensely bloated midsection, Naruto was starting to get a sense of that same fullness Hunter and Kiba had felt, but was determined not to quit just yet.  \"C'mon, airhead, you're almost there!\" cheered Kiba weakly.  Looking down, Naruto noticed that he had indeed almost finished his ramen.  With just roughly a fourth of the ramen left to go, Naruto was reinvigorated with confidence and determination.  Feeling how much lighter the bowl had become with so much of the ramen already depleted, Naruto decided to power through the rest of the ramen as quick as he could before his aching belly could protest any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the ample bowl and bringing it to his lips with all his might, Naruto's mouth opened wide as he; much to everyone's shock, began to pour the still steady amount of ramen and broth into his determined mouth.  Only now, rather than take big mouthfuls, he took steady, smaller mouthfuls and swallowed them on the spot, practically inhaling and gulping down the ramen as he went without chewing it any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, Hunter, even Akamaru all watched in amazement as the bowl steadily decreased with each quick passing gulp.  All the while, his belly continued to press outward more and more, to the point where; like Hunter and Kiba, it was beginning to restrict against Naruto's pants.  Naruto winced with discomfort as he continued to gulp down his ramen, but didn't want to stop and unbutton in fear of losing momentum.  So he continued to gulp down his ramen, causing more of a strain on his pants button as he continued to gulp down the incoming ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, much to everyone's surprise, Naruto had finally and successfully drained his massive bowl of any ramen or broth before his pants button could be busted off.  Slamming his now empty bowl to the table, Naruto groaned weakly and leaned back in his chair as his arms dropped to his sides, as he smiled weakly and said, \"Finally....\"  He was about to unbutton his pants and celebrate winning a weeks worth of the best ramen ever cooked by man, but before he could unbutton anything, Kiba got his attention and said, \"Umm, Naruto, aren't you forgetting something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Naruto looked back at the table, and in that instant, his enthusiasm and spirit had all but died.  \"....Oh.\"  was all Naruto could mutter, upon seeing the sight of the practically untouched and massive pitcher of cola he still had to drain.  The boy's lip quivered a bit pitifully as he almost wanted to cry at what was sure to await him and his all-too-full tummy.  As he grabbed the pitcher, his ballooned out gut growled in protest, causing him to whimper in pain, and let go of the pitcher.  As much as he wanted to, his belly was in far too much pain from all he had already consumed, that not even the thought of free Ichiraku's could push him to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Naruto!  You've toughed it out through worse, you can do this!\" cheered a slightly more energetic Kiba, who; for once, didn't refer to Naruto as some kind of insult with head attached to the end of it.  \"You got this, ninja boy!  We believe in you!\" cheered Hunter, also a bit more enthusiastically despite his own fullness.<br>\r\n\"Damn straight we believe in you!\" responded Kiba.  Even Akamaru couldn't help but bark for encouragement for the disheartened blond boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing all this, Naruto's spirit immediately lightened, as a smile grew over his face.  Suddenly, he was filled with new determination to see this last obstacle through.  However frighteningly huge that pitcher may be, he was gonna gulp every last drop down.  Not for a free week of Ichiraku's ramen, but because his pals believed in him, and the last thing he was gonna do after all this was let his friends down....of course, the free week of Ichiraku's ramen was definitely going to be a plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Naruto grabbed a hold of the pitcher and stared down that massive carbonated beverage with confidence.  \"Alright, let's do this!\" shouted Naruto.  Once again his stomach groaned in protest, but this time, Naruto simply rolled his eyes and said, \"Oh shut up,\" and proceeded to force himself to lift the surprisingly heavy pitcher...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Right as the pitcher was being lifted to his lips, Naruto winced as he felt a cutting pain in his midsection. <i>Oh yeah...my pants.</i> Slowly, he set the pitcher back down on the table. <i>Well, finishing the rest of that soda's probably gonna be a lot easier if my pants aren't putting so much pressure on my tummy...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end, he leaned back in his chair, sucked his distended tummy in as far as he could, and reached his hands down to his waistline. He fumbled around a bit, trying to get past the massive obstruction. Finally, his hands found the button; pulling it out of the hole, Naruto sighed in relief as the pressure abated,his stomach bulging out a few inches and his fly being forced down a few teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...much better,\" Naruto smiled, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. Looking at the massive pitcher of soda on the table, he faltered a bit, but remembering his friends' faith in him (and the prospect of a week of free Ichiraku's), he gathered his courage, seized the massive pitcher, and brought it up to his mouth, tilting it upwards with such speed that some ended up spilling and running down his cheeks. Paying this no mind, he opened wide and began gulping down the sweet, bubbly liquid, wincing as it flowed into his already overstuffed belly, expanding it even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, Hunter, and Akamaru watched in awe as Naruto gulped down the pitcher. \"Wow, lookit him go...\" Kiba muttered, burping lightly and licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's tail wagged. <i>Well, at least he remembered to unbutton his pants...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter watched as Naruto continued gulping down the soda, inflating his tummy in the process. \"Yeah...but his stomach's startin' to get about as big as ours are, and he's nowhere near done yet. Ya ask me, even if he undid his pants, something's gonna pop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked over at him quizzically. \"Huh? Whaddaya mean?\" Hunter smirked and pointed to his own furry navel, itself a pit. \"...oh, I get it.\" Kiba giggled. \"That's actually happened to the bonehead and I coupla times in the past when we competed.\" A thoughtful look appeared on his face. \"It felt kinda weird, but nice, too...\" Kiba looked over at Akamaru, smirking. \"And Akamaru liked it, too.\" The dog immediately blushed and looked away. <i>Ya bat at someone's belly-button one time, and no one lets you forget it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed, causing his belly to jostle, though the food had begun to settle, and he no longer felt quite as sick from it. Regardless, he calmed down, managing to still his belly and look over at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was currently leaning back in his chair, pitcher on the table. Naruto was groaning and massaging his tummy, which was even further inflated from the soda and causing his hoodie to ride up even further. And, though Hunter was in no position to see it, his fly had also been forced down several more teeth. Hunter winced, but as his eyes fell upon the pitcher, his eyes widened. Astonishingly, within that first go, Naruto had polished off a quarter of it; he really was determined to win that prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto spent a few more seconds groaning, before he pressed upon his belly and let loose with a massive belch. Licking his lips, he picked the pitcher up again and resumed guzzling the cola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes ticked by as the liquid poured into his gut, and his tummy continued to inflate. By this point, it easily rivaled Hunter and Kiba's in size, and it still kept on going. By the time he plopped it down again, it was down to half its original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter whooped, holding an arm up in the air. \"Woohoo! Go, Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba did the same. \"C'mon, don't give up now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolstered by these words, Naarruto spent only a few moments resting before forcing out another burp and picked the massive pitcher up once again. However, instead of tilting it to his lips immediately, he began taking deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru stared. <i>Is...is he really...</i> His eyes bugged out. <i>No way...he wouldn't...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a glint in his eyes, Naruto once again brought the cola to his lips, tilting it back even further and gulping it down even faster than before. As a result, his stomach started ballooning out even faster than before. By now, his fly was undoubtedly fully opened, but that was of little concern to him at the moment as he guzzled the soda down. By now, his hoodie was resting completely atop his belly, the fleshy globe totally exposed for the whole world to see, and it only continued to get bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes ticked by as Naruto continued gulping down the beverage, only lowering it slightly to take several quick breaths before continuing to gulp it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, there was only a little cola left in the pitcher. Naruto was starting to turn a bit green, but he steeled himself and pressed on, guzzling the soda even as he felt a familiar sensation in his navel. And, as with the night before, as the last of the soda landed in his gut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...his navel violently inverted, popping out and wobbling for the whole world to see. When that was done, Naruto promptly dropped the massive pitcher to the ground and slumped back in his chair, looking completely out of it. \"Uhhhh....\" he moaned. Suddenly, his cheeks bulged, and his hands flew to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's eyes widened. \"Naruto?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba swore. \"Ah man, don't lose it now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru winced, turning away. <i>I can't watch this....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued to hold his hands over his mouth, heaving a couple of times. Then, his hands fell away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and the young boy let loose with what was quite possibly the loudest, longest, queasiest belch any of them had ever heard. Some of those in attendance could have even sworn they'd felt the ground vibrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant, on the other hand, quickly composed himself and walked over to Naruto, holding the bloated boy's arm high in the air. \"Congratulations, kiddo! You did it!\" Naruto was too queasy to say anything, but he did manage a weak grin. \"Hope your appetites hold up, 'cause you've just won a week of free Ichiraku's!\" Reaching inside his pocket, the man brought out three slips of paper and slid them inside one of Naruto's pockets. \"Make sure ya hold onto these!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..m'kay...\" Naruto mumbled, dazedly. Chuckling, the attendant helped him out of his seat and towards the others, his belly and navel jostling, sloshing, and wobbling all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Kiba's faces lit up as the boy drew near them. \"All right, Naruto!\" Hunter cheered, massaging his tummy. \"You did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Whaddaya know, bonehead; you're good for something after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glared at Kiba, but this quickly devolved into a weak giggle, ending in a belch. Laughing himself, the attendant helped Naruto to the ground, gently laying him out next to Kiba. \"Rest up, boys; you've earned it!\" Ruffling them each on the tops of their heads, he headed back towards the table to help clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two youths spent a minute or two congratulating Naruto, who didn't reply but simply grinned like a dope, both at the praise and at the prize they'd won. Soon, though, Hunter yawned. \"Dunno about you guys, but I could really go for a nap right about now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Kiba agreed, yawning. \"Me too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..m'too,\" Naruto mumbled, belching again and causing his gut and navel to wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the three stuffed youths, Akamaru couldn't help but wag his tail. <i>You three are crazy,</i> he woofed fondly, moving behind them and gently nudging them into upright sitting positions. When the were sitting up enough, Akamaru settled down, the three resting against his body. <i>Still, I guess I should congratulate you; you all did great.</i> Akamaru's tail wagged for a few seconds before he realized that no one was replying. <i>Guys?</i> Looking down, he saw the three...and smiled a doggy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three children had already fallen fast asleep, leaning against Akamaru's body in various positions. Hunter's head was leaning towards the side, one hand on his belly and his tongue lolling out the side of his mouth. Kiba was snoring slightly, his head tilted back and his arms up on Akamaru's body as though he were sitting on a bench. And Naruto...Naruto was snoring gently, one arm lying limp at his side while his other one was being held up, his thumb squarely in his mouth, a contented smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They're so cute,</i> Akamaru thought, wagging his tail. <i>Almost makes this all worth it.</i> With that, Akamaru yawned, laid his head down, and shut his eyes, ready to get some sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A considerable amount of time had passed as day turned to night, and what little crowd was nearing the area was all but gone, leaving the three youths still resting atop a now sleeping Akamaru.  Some more time had passed as the four slept away the night, until the young pup groaned a bit and groggily rubbed his eyes.  \"Rgh...whoa, how long were we out?\" asked Hunter, still half asleep as he absent mindedly rubbed his considerably deflated tummy, now small enough only to expose a bit of furry flesh just below his belly button.  \"Guys?\"  Curious, he turned to see everyone else; Akamaru included, still out like lights.  Upon seeing the silly but undeniably adorable positions Naruto and Kiba were in as they rested on the giant dog, Hunter giggled, then excitedly rose up from his position as carefully as he could so as not to wake anyone, while still holding his pants up because of his busted button.  \"Oh man, this is too good!\" he said to himself doing his best to contain his laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back to get a clear view of all three of them, it seems more time had passed than Hunter initially thought.  Kiba's stomach had also shrunk a good amount, to where it was once again small enough to only expose a bit of flesh right near his belly button.  Naruto's stomach seemed to have extended out the largest of the three, but his belly had also shrunken down to where his hoodie was now only riding just above what was once again, his innie navel.  Hunter grabbed his phone; notably larger in his paws due to his condensed size, and flash-snapped a perfect shot of all three resting the days' feasting.  Looking down at the image on his phone, Hunter smiled and said, \"Perfect,\" before glancing at the time on his phones.  Suddenly his smile dropped as his eyes widened nervously.  \"Oh crud...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately putting his phone away, he stepped towards the resting three and shook the heavy sleepers awake, causing them to slowly flutter awake in annoyance.  \"Ugh, what's the big idea?\" asked a half dazed Kiba while Naruto groaned in the same annoyance as a child would being woken to go to school.  Akamaru's eyes eventually opened as he glanced back at Hunter and thought, <i>What's wrong?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrasping his tanktop's collar and pulling it nervously, Hunter replied to all three and said, \"We may've slept in a little longer than we should have.\"<br>\r\n\"mm'so?\" replied Naruto as he once again tried resting against Akamaru.<br>\r\n\"Soooo it may be in our best interest to head back to the inn so we can put on our adult clothes before we grow back and bust all the clothes we're wearing.\"<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, both Naruto and Kiba's eyes immediately snapped open, as they nervously turned towards the pup and asked, \"...All?\"<br>\r\n\"ALL.\" replied Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back horrified amongst each other, Naruto and Kiba immediately rose up and, despite their still pretty distended tummies, sprinted faster than they'd ever sprinted in their lives back towards the inn.  Hunter immediately followed, gaining enough momentum to where he had to run on all fours.  Akamaru simply sighed, watching the three go off, then opted to follow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all three youths running for their lives...or in this case, their dignity, it became a pretty close knit race that no one was really racing.  Without even realizing it, all three managed to make it to the inn at the exact same time with Akamaru watching, surprisingly impressed with their speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the inn, all three youths stopped, panting and gasping from utter exhaustion.  \"Phew...w-we.....we made it....\" muttered a beyond exhausted Naruto, before plopping on his back, still breathing heavily.  \"Hey...un-unless you plan to get changed on the ground, y-you getter get your butt up and change!\" complained Kiba as he immediately grabbed his adult clothes and ran into the bathroom.  Groaning in annoyance, Naruto forced himself up and grabbed his clothes, waiting for Kiba to get out while Hunter grabbed his clothes and just changed them and there.  Looking back, Naruto immediately turned away and yelled, \"Aww, again with that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Hunter scoffed and said half exhausted and half annoyed, \"Fur!  Wolf!  Remember?!\"  As Akamaru pranced inside, he saw Hunter wearing his adult clothes about a couple sizes too large for himself while Kiba stepped out of the bathroom in his clothes in the exact same state.  He couldn't help but snicker.  <i>I've never seen anyone look so ridiculous yet so adorable at the same time!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Har har,\" was all Hunter could muster, still panting and breathing heavily while Naruto went inside and changed into his adult clothes as well.  Stepping back out in his oversized clothes, Naruto couldn't help but smirk victoriously, \"Least we made it in time...\"<br>\r\n\"We sure did!\" exclaimed Hunter.<br>\r\n\"I was terrified the whole way here...honestly, I thought every step I took, I was gonna suddenly grow back into an adult and find myself running around town NAKED...\" noted Kiba as he shuddered, mortified at the thought.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...there's an image I don't need to be seeing...\" responded an equally horrified Naruto.<br>\r\n<i>Did you notice how much faster you got here than you did when you were racing to the park?</i>  asked Akamaru to only Hunter and Kiba, causing them both to turn to him curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, when we raced, we were just having fun.  This was life or...utter embarrassment...\" responded Kiba while Hunter nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<i>But when you were just competing, you were still being hindered by wanting to get somewhere faster than each other,</i> responded Akamaru.  <i>Notice how when you all ran and didn't care who got here first, you all pushed yourself equally hard enough and got here at the same time?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping for a moment, Kiba considered that, and after glancing back at Hunter and Naruto, and recollecting the race against time to get to the inn, he gaped, \"Wow, we DID all get here at the same time!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah,\" responded Naruto to Kiba, \"we didn't wanna be too late and grow back up and be running around showing things we....shouldn't be showing...\"<br>\r\n\"Not even just that,\" noted Hunter as he struggled to keep his adult glasses over his face, \"look at how much food we stuffed into our guts today.  We didn't tough it out the way we did because we wanted to beat each other.  We toughed it out because we were all working together to get ourselves-\"<br>\r\n\"-Free Ichiraku's for a FULL WEEK!\" snapped Naruto happily, cutting Hunter off as he smirked and rubbed the back of his furry head, \"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" noted Naruto as he scratched his head, trying to process everything that was being said.  \"So it's like, we get what and where we need when we're not going up against each other, but...just pushing on towards whatever the goal is...\" chuckling, he continued and said, \"we do pretty good, don't we?\"<br>\r\nSmiling, Hunter nodded and said, \"You got that right!\"<br>\r\nFolding his arms together and smirking, Kiba nodded and said, \"Sure, when it MATTERS, we know how to pull through.  But there's nothing wrong with a lil competition if it's just for fun, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Hunter nodded and said, \"Heh, guess you got us there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the three began to feel a little funny as their bodies began to tingle all over.  \"Whoa....I feel weird,\" noted Naruto before hiccuping suddenly.  Within that instant, all three grew back into their adult forms, fitting snugly and perfectly into the overgrown clothes their child forms were sporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back at each other, and observing their own bodies.  Their midsections had all shrunken down to virtually their normal sizes in the process of growing up.  Admittedly, there was a loss of energy between the three in their older forms, but they retained enough of what they'd learned and enjoyed throughout the day to where there was still a universal sense of happiness and joy between them, even if they were still pretty exhausted, moreso now that they were older again.  \"Ahh, feels good to be back to normal,\" noted Kiba.  \"Yeah....still, it felt awesome to be a kid again...\" noted Naruto.  With a smile, Hunter waved his hand-paw forward and said, \"Ah don't worry about it, we got plenty of those vials to last us all week and THEN SOME!  But since it's late, it's better if we stay grown up since we'll be sleeping soon, and if we slept in our kid forms, it'd kinda be a waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in agreement, Naruto yawned and said, \"Good thing too, cause I'm pooped...\"  Hunter yawned in agreement and scratched his once again thin furry stomach from beneath his tanktop and said, \"Guess we should probably call it a night then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba didn't respond.  He simply grinned mischievously and glanced back at the two.  \"I dunno about the rest of you, but all that growing up suddenly kinda made me a lil hungry,\" he said, still smirking as he pointed the two towards the still ample amount of room service they had left since the morning.  \"Whadduya say we warm all that up and end the night the way three winners SHOULD end a night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching the back of his head, Naruto glanced uneasily and said, \"I dunno, I kinda just wanna sle-\"  But before he could finish his sentence, his own, slim-again stomach let out a rather audible roar of hunger, causing him to blush suddenly, while Hunter's own stomach groaned in agreement with Kiba.  Smirking, Hunter turned to Naruto. \"I'm pretty tired too, but I definitely wouldn't mind going to sleep with a full gut,\" he said as he patted his stomach eager.  \"But you pulled us to victory, so it's up to you, Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought for a moment while his stomach was still growling to where it almost sounded mad at Naruto for not immediately saying yes.  Finally, he decided...</span></div></div>",

He took a breath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf slowly began shrinking, his stomach following suit at a slightly slower pace. His shirt and shorts-at least, those parts still not being pushed against by his belly-slowly began taking on a more baggy appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto recoiled, causing his chair to scoot back a bit. \"H-he's getting smaller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba squinted at him. \"N-not just that...\" His eyes widened as his muzzle and head began noticeably shrinking along with the rest of his body. \"H-he's getting younger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking open an eye, Hunter grinned impishly at Kiba. \"Toldja,\" the wolf retorted playfully. The two boys (and dog) started; his voice was noticeably lighter and higher than it had been before. Sighing, he closed his eyes again and continued to relax as the change continued to sweep over him. At this point, his stomach had actually shrunken a good deal, to the point where his now rather-baggy shirt all but completely covered it...but he wasn't done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued shrinking into his clothes, his arms retreating further into his shirt. His fur, though not necessarily coarse before, grew softer and softer, almost like that of a pup's. In addition, his muzzle became less pointed and more rounded, again like a pup's. Even  his legs were beginning to retreat within his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three from Konoha watched, awestruck, as Hunter continued to grow younger, his limbs vanishing into his clothing. Even his glasses, unable to be supported by his muzzle, tumbled off and clattered to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed as the transformation continued, until, finally, Hunter stopped shrinking. Sighing and opening his eyes, he looked at Naruto, Kiba, and Akamaru's expressions, squinting...and promptly burst into a fit of giggles. \"Heehee, you guys should see your faces!\" His voice, matching his body, was now that of a young child's: perky, high-pitched, spritely, and full of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three were too shocked by what they saw in front of them to respond. Sitting at the opposite end of the table, every part of his body except for his head and tail swathed in garments that were now far too big for him, was what could only be described as an anthropomorphic wolf pup. The fur covering his head (and the rest of his body as well, presumably) now had a softer, almost fuzzy look to it, and little tail, having shrunk in proportion with the rest of him, wagged merrily behind him. Even his stomach had shrunken a great deal, to the point where it was only visible as a slight impression beneath the shirt concealing his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Akamaru forced himself to bark, <i>Damn, he's...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's <i>adorable</i>,\" Kiba muttered, not quite able to believe what he was saying. Naruto snickered, but was unable to tear his gaze away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaming, Hunter reached a much smaller arm out of his clothes and rubbed the back of his head. \"Aww, you guys are too nice,\" he giggled, kicking his legs happily through his shorts. \"Ya know, if ya wanna, I really like tummy rubs...\" He tried to move his other arm to scratch his tummy for emphasis, but found it restricted by the overlarge clothing. \"Heh heh...just gimme a second.\" Vanishing within his shirt for a moment, he fumbled with it for a bit before getting a good grip on it and tossing it off him. That taken care of, he all but hopped out of his shorts and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's eyes bugged out. \"Oh come on, now you're streaking too?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, covering his eyes with a hand, nonetheless said, \"Well, he said nothing's really showing 'cause of his fur...buuuut it might still be creepy if I look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling at the two, Hunter squinted and made his way over to his duffel. Rooting through it (and throwing various items and articles of clothing through the air in the process), he finally came up with an outfit he liked. Grinning, he slipped the clothing on. Once he'd gotten the shirt adjusted and the shorts buttoned and zipped, he rooted through the bag for something else. His now much smaller hands/paws grabbed something; wagging his tail, he retrieved a new, smaller pair of glasses and perched them on his muzzle. Adjusting them, he grinned as his vision cleared. \"Ahh, much better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the clothes he'd chosen to get a better look-a black tank top with a blue crescent moon in the center of it and brown khaki shorts-he nodded in satisfaction before darting back to his chair and clambering back up. \"There we go; lots more comfy now.\" Choosing to ignore the stares of the others, Hunter rubbed his stomach-the appendage having shrunken enough that it was now only a bump beneath his shirt-and grinned. \"Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm still famished!\" Drawing an extra-large plate of scrambled eggs and bacon towards him, he began cramming it into his waiting maw, not even bothering to use utensils as his tail wagged and his legs kicked gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba, still not quite able to fully process what had just happened, continued to gape at the little anthro-pup happily stuffing his craw. Hunter took note of this; scrambled eggs dotting his muzzle, he looked up and smirked at the others. \"Well? What are you guys waiting for?\" He giggled impishly. \"That is, unless you're planning on losing to a little pup...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did it: Naruto and Kiba glanced at each other, exchanged determined glares, and drew more food toward them as well, stuffing their mouths as well (though still using utensils.) Beaming in satisfaction, Hunter continued stuffing his own craw, satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru merely stared at the sight. <i>This day just keeps on getting weirder and weirder...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes ticked by and they continued to eat and eat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The little anthro-pup gleefully crammed as much scrambled eggs and bacon into his mouth as he could possibly fit, occasionally so fast that he'd have to adjust his glasses to keep from jumping off his eager little head.  Neither Naruto nor Kiba were letting up either, occasionally glancing up at Hunter and back down at their food, more determined than ever to put away more than the little critter stuffing his little face across from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>H-holy crap...who'd uh' thought being younger could make you THAT much faster...?!</i>  Naruto thought hastily as he continued cramming his mouth with more and more scrambled eggs.  Kiba fared no better, frantically not wanting to be shown up by a kid...let alone a puppy kid.  Akamaru simply watched, still a bit dumbfounded, but at the same time, partially amused by the sight of watching the little anthro pup so eagerly stuffing his face, occasionally spewing bits of egg in the air as he tore into his plate with both paws.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hehe, he's eating just like Kiba used when he was around at that age.  It's a bit silly to watch, but I'll be damned if it isn't a little adorable...</i>  Akamaru mused, snickering to himself as the sight went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more, Hunter's pile of scrambled eggs and bacon had shrunken considerably, while that little bump his tummy was making beneath his shirt continued to get larger and larger with the sheer volume of food being consumed in such ample and quick volume.   Both Naruto and Kiba's stomachs also continued to bloat with their stuffing their craws, but their plates still carried much more than Hunter's, and both had a bit of a more anxious look, seeing that they were losing to a pup, causing them to try and eat faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, little Hunter stopped mid-bite, and grasped his belly with both paws as a look of discomfort grew over his face.  Eventually both Naruto and Kiba looked up and noticed, and immediately started smirking smugly.  \"Hehe, awww, what's the matter?  Feeling full already, little fella...?\" Kiba taunted.  But Hunter didn't respond, and instead, began to whine, causing the smirks on Naruto's and Kiba's faces to vanish as a look of concern grew slowly grew over their faces.  \"H-hey, you okay?\" asked Naurto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My tummy hurts...\" whined Hunter, as he attempted to massage his aching belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think he got a little too carried away too quick, Akamaru noted.  Kiba nodded in agreement and said, \"Looks like it.\"  Then; as if a light bulb had gone off in his head, immediately, he smirked and got up from his seat, approaching the little aching pup, earning a curious glance from Naruto.  \"Hey, what're you up to, Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kiba knelt down towards Hunter and rested his hand atop Hunter's tummy and proceeded to gently rub the anthro wolf pup's tummy, as he replied, \"Well, he DID say he liked tummy rubs...besides, wolf-person-kid-thing or not, a pup is a pup.  Right, Akamaru?\"  Akamaru barked in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, the pained expression on Hunter's face vanished, and in its' stead, an almost blissfully goofy smile grew over his muzzle as he opened his jaw and let his tongue hang out slightly, panting as his little tail wagged happily.  \"Ohhh yeah...that's the spot, right there!\" Hunter exclaimed happily as his hind leg began kicking senselessly, earning a laugh from Kiba as he continued.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the scene, albeit dumbfounded, Naruto couldn't help but grin.  \"Haha, hate to say it, but you were dead on, Kiba.  He is adorable,\" admitted Naruto, earning a chuckle from Akamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Especially like that.  Most pups are stupidly cute when they're getting their tummies scratched,</i> noted Akamaru, despite Naruto not understanding a single word of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after some time had passed, \"Feeling better?\" asked Kiba as he took his hand off the pup's tummy.  \"Much better!\" replied Hunter as he glanced back up at Kiba and beamed happily at the teen.  \"You're a miracle worker, Kiba!  Thanks a bunch\"  Kiba simply grinned and ruffled the top of the pup's fuzzy head gently, so as not to knock his glasses off.  \"Heh, anytime, 'kiddo'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter rubbed the back of his head and giggled as Kiba headed back to his seat, earning a lick from Akamaru.  <i>Nice job, buddy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Naruto playfully nudged Kiba in the arm and said, \"Y'know, that was pretty nice'uh ya,\" noted Naruto.  Kiba simply shrugged and said, \"What can I say?  Being a dog-nin means I'm kind of a pro in this department.\"  He then glanced back at Hunter and, more slyly, said, \"besides...wouldn't be fair of me to school you and this little fella if his gut's achin'.\"  Immediately, Hunter grinned back and licked his chops.  \"That's the spirit!\" Hunter said eagerly as he rubbed his paws together and pulled his chair back towards the table.  \"And how about you, Naru-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stopped mid-sentence as he saw that Naruto had already resumed stuffing his face with a grin on his face.  \"H-hey, no cheating!\" barked Kiba as he too; resumed stuffing his face competitively.  Hunter simply grinned and said, \"Get ready to lose, 'old timers',\" and immediately, resumed stuffing his little maw with as much food as he possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru simply shook his head and smirked to himself.  <i>Ehh, as weird as this whole thing may be, at least it's in good fun...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more time went on...</span></div></div>",

As amazing as Kiba's tummy rub had felt, he didn't want to force the dog-nin to keep on getting up just to comfort him....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking note of Hunter's more controlled pace, Naruto and Kiba forced themselves to go even faster, eager to get a lead on the hungry little pup. To this end, they forked massive helpings of eggs into their mouths with one hand, and grabbed huge handfuls of bacon in the other. Soon, the entire table was caught up in a frenzy of flying bits of eggs, bits of bacon, and a great deal of chewing and swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the pace the three were going at, their stomachs slowly but surely grew even more. Hunter's tummy continued to grow beneath his shirt, the sphere expanding and continuing to stretch the fabric of his tank top. At this rate, it wouldn't be long before it started peeking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba's bellies, which had already forced their shirts a couple inches above their navels, nonetheless continued to swell as well, growing heavier in their laps, pushing their shirts up more, and forcing apart the few teeth of their flies that were still zipped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, even as he crammed his mouth full of eggs and bacon, took notice of Naruto and Kiba's growing guts, causing him to giggle wildly, his tail wagging happily. <i>Oh wow...look how quick their tummies are growing!</i> He giggled even harder as the thought occured to him. <i>Damn, I forgot how potent this stuff was!</i> He kicked his legs happily, gulping down his current mouthful and rubbing his tummy contentedly. <i>I gotta do this more often!</i> Licking his chops, he grabbed a huge mound of bacon in two hands and brought it up to his face, happily munching on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba, surprisingly, paused in their eating to stare at the wolf pup happily chowing down on bacon, a huge smile on his muzzle. Seeing just how damn <i>happy</i> he looked, they were both momentarily overcome by just how <i>cute</i> he looked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining his composure, Naruto glanced at Kiba, still staring at Hunter, then at said pup, who was eating his helping of bacon at a surprisingly leisurely pace. Both of them had slowed down, being as occupied as they were. The blonde smirked. <i>Perfect.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips, Naruto pulled his plate closer to him, grabbed a fork in each hand, and began shoveling eggs and bacon into his mouth like crazy, not wanting to waste this opportunity. To his surprise, he was able to do this for a full minute or so before someone notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Naruto's noisy eating, Kiba's head whipped toward the blonde, his face contorting in a scowl. \"H-hey, no fair!\" Growling, he grabbed a fork in each hand as well and began forking food into his mouth, grunting as he did so. \"Lousy cheater....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter took notice as well, but rather than take offense, he beamed happily. <i>Heehee, looks like Naruto got the drop on us.</i> Shrugging, he set his bacon down and smacked his chops. <i>Better get back in the game, but before I do...</i> His eyes scanned the table, lighting up as they fell on a big pitcher of milk. <i>Ah, there we go.</i> Grabbing the pitcher (and struggling a bit with trying to hold it in his smaller paws,) he lifted the tilted the whole thing to his mouth and let the cool liquid flow down his throat. <i>Mmm, whole milk...</i> His tail wagged, and he had to struggle not to giggle as he drank the milk. <i>Yummy!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Naruto had established a notable lead over Kiba, his plate looking somewhat more depleted than the dog-nin's. Noticing this, Kiba grit his teeth and dove into his plate even more savagely than before. In the meantime, Hunter had depleted the pitcher halfway; setting it down and licking his chops, he burped, giggled, and dove back into his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, their stomachs had grown some more. Naruto and Kiba's shirts were nearly resting on top of their bellies (though Naruto's was a bit higher,) and they'd had to scoot back a bit so their midsections wouldn't be pressing into the table. Predictably, the flame symbol on Naruto's shirt had gotten even more distorted, crinkling up and folding under itself a bit. Hunter's stomach, as a result of the eggs, bacon, and most recently the milk, had swollen noticeably, even forcing his tank top up slightly to reveal a sliver of furry flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnperturbed by any of this, the three continued shoveling their respective meals into their mouths, with Hunter occasionally pausing to take hearty swigs of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Akamaru occasionally had to duck on account of all the shards of food fragments flying every which way from the table.  Shaking his head, he scoffed.  <i>There's a wolf pup scarfing down an entire piles worth of eggs and bacon with his bare paws, and he's STILL not the most ravenous eater at this table...that...should say something...</i>  But Akamaru's train of thought was interrupted when a whole piece of bacon nailed him in the face.  \"Oops!  S-sorry about that, boy!\" called out Kiba sheepishly, despite a mouth full of bacon.  Luckily, Akamaru simply sighed and proceeded to snatch the piece by his jaw and immediately wolf it down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter; however, kept his focus on Naruto, who had since, taken the lead and was nearing the finish.  Thinking a little more competitively, the wolf-pup grinned impishly to himself.  <i>Hehe, time to turn the cuteness up a few notches...let's see you resist that, Naruto...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, as the three continued on, Hunter stopped for a moment and sighed a big, happy sigh.  \"Boy oh boy!  These are the fluffiest, yummiest eggs I've ever tasted!\" Hunter exclaimed gleefully as he shut his eyes and smiled a wide, puppy smile and proceeded to happily pat his bloated tummy with both his little paws.  All the while wagging his little puppy tail happily and rapidly.  Both teens stopped and saw the adorably blissful look on the puppy's face, and almost immediately in unison, both their hearts damn near melted at the scene.  But Hunter didn't stop there.  Sensing he had both Naruto's and Kiba's attention, he giggled an innocent, childish, happy giggle, and both teens, despite themselves, both went dopey eyed and at the same time, went \"Awwww...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a canine himself, Akamaru chuckled to himself and raised an eyebrow at the scene.  <i>Okay, now THAT'S unfair...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter opened his puppy eyes and saw the two ninjas practically gawking at him in a trance-like manner.  <i>Hehe, gotcha...</i> Hunter thought as he licked his little chops and proceeded to grab more of the remaining contents on his plate.  He continued to scarf away unopposed for a good minute, until Kiba and Naruto shook it off and realized that they'd been had.  \"H-hey, that's not fair!\" Naruto complained, but Hunter simply looked up at him innocently, and again, caused his heart to melt, however aware he may have been.  \"Oooooh, that's low, Hunter...nnng...and positively a-freakin'-dorable...GAAAH!\"  Snapping himself out of it, Naruto saw that both Hunter AND Kiba were still chomping away, and immediately, he forced himself to scarf away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cuteness overload trance Hunter had inflicted on Kiba and Naruto may have been brief, but it was just the edge he needed to regain the lead on Kiba, and Naruto especially, putting him behind Kiba as well, as his plate had depleted even more than the blond's had.  Finally, after some doing, Hunter had managed to polish what was once a massive pile of scrambled eggs and crispy bacon, into little more than a few flakes and crumbs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, that was yummy!\" exclaimed Hunter, patting his tummy proudly, burping audibly shortly after, eliciting a giggle from the pup as he licked his chops and turned his attention back to the pitcher of milk still on the table.  \"Heehee, and now, for an equally yummy drink to wash that all down with!\"  Hunter struggled again, but managed to pick up the pitcher as he proceeded to drink away.  Watching the pup struggle was so obscenely cute a scene, even Akamaru went a little glossy eyed as he chugged away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, come on, no pup is THAT madly cute...!</i> Akamaru thought, immediately shaking himself out of his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Naruto glanced back at Kiba, seeing him once again dumbfounded by cuteness, and grinned mischievously as he proceeded to get to work and try to regain his lead on the dog-nin...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba gaped, still dumbfounded by how damn adorable Hunter looked as he leaned back in his seat, little paws gripping the sides of the oversizedpitcher and pouring the milk down his eager gullet. Heedless of the milk that streamed down the sides of his muzzle, the pup grinned happily as he chugged, tail wagging and legs swinging. His tummy, already having grown a bit more from his polishing off his plate, continued to slowly swell as more and more of the thick, creamy milk entered it, slowly forcing his tank top up higher and exposing more of his brown, furry belly. <i>His gut's kinda getting bigger,</i> Kiba thought in a daze. <i>Wonder if he's gonna need another tummy rub soon...</i> The wolf pup had looked so <i>happy</i> when he'd given him the tummy rub earlier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, a piece of egg smacked Kiba in the face. <i>Eh? What the...</i> Scowling irritably, he wiped it off and turned in the direction from where it had flown...and his eyes widened as he saw Naruto shoveling bacon and eggs into his craw as fast as he could. \"Naruto?!\" Kiba exclaimed, narrowing his eyes. Naruto started a bit mid-mouthful, causing a look of discomfort to grow across his face. Bolting upright, he rapidly pounded his chest. Finally, after the discomfort in his chest had settled and his face eased up, he turned to glare at Kiba. \"What the hell was that about, Kiba?!\" Naruto demanded of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba glared back. \"Don't give me that crap! You were stuffing your face while I was...um...occupied,\" he faltered a bit as he got to the last part, but his glare remained intact. From the floor, Akamaru wagged his tail. <i>Trust me, pal, you weren't the only one who was 'occupied'...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scoffed. \"Occupied? Yeah, so was I, but I was man enough to snap out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grit his teeth. \"Oh, like <i>you</i> weren't 'occupied' for a full minute before you snapped out of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto opened his mouth, but faltered when he realized Kiba had a point; he HAD succumbed to Hunter's cuteness at least a couple of times, and it had taken some effort to snap himself out of it. \"Y-yeah, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Heh, thought so.\" Then, without warning, he turned back towards his plate and resumed shoveling its contents into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey!\" Naruto protested, scowling and turning back to his own plate. \"No fa---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, he made the mistake of looking up and across the table at little Hunter, still guzzling his milk. At this point, his stomach had swollen enough that it had forced his tank top just high enough so it was barely concealing his belly-button, and the pup appeared to be having the time of his life as he shut his eyes and grinned, adjusting his small paws to get a better grip on the pitcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eye twitched. \"Hnnnngh...damn it, Hunter...\" the boy cursed to himself, his heart once again turning to goo at the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this out the side of his eyes, Kiba smirked and went even faster, determined not to lose his new edge. Bacon and eggs flew every which way as more and more was forced down his gullet, his already-swollen belly slowly bulging bigger. His shorts began feeling tight, in spite of the fact that they were unbuttoned and unzipped, but he ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Naruto managed to snap himself out of the cuteness-trance; looking over at his dog-nin friend, he was shocked to see that the plate was already halfway gone. Panicking a bit internally, he leaped back into his own plate, trying frantically to catch up. However, Kiba had gotten far too much of a head start, and by the time Naruto had reduced his own plate halfway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah,\" Kiba sighed, dropping his fork on his now-empty plate and leaning back in his chair. \"That was <i>good</i>...\" Giving a satisfied burp, he let one arm dangle at his side while his other hand was used to contentedly pat his stomach. Naruto, even with a mouthful of bacon and eggs, gave Kiba the stinkeye. Unperturbed, the dog-nin grinned in response. Even Akamaru glanced up at the two. <i>Heh; nice one, Kiba.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed, reaching down and ruffling the dog's head. \"Aww, thanks, boy...\" Glaring at the two, Naruto continued digging into his plate, determined to clean it just as thoroughly as Kiba had cleaned his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Hunter had plunked the now-empty milk pitcher down on the table. His stomach had swollen some more, enough where his tanktop now exposed just enough of his belly for his navel, furred-over as it was, to be visible. \"Mmmm,\" the pup sighed, leaning back in his seat and massaging his belly with both paws. \"That was really yummy...\" Suddenly, his muzzle flew open and a rather wet-sounding belch escaped. Giggling, he rubbed the back of his head. \"Heh; 'scuse me.\" Licking his muzzle, he sat up in his seat and examined the other three; Kiba was leaning back in his chair and rubbing his belly, which, at this point, forced his shirt to rest entirely on top of it. In spite of this, he was chatting with Akamaru, even as he threw sly looks at Naruto, whose stomach and shirt was in much the same state, as the blonde whittled his plate down to a quarter of what it used to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter beamed happily at the sight. <i>Heehee; even stuffed, they're still spirited.</i> He rested his hands/paws on his seat and idly kicked his legs. <i>Come to think of it, I'm still a little hungry too...</i> His eyes widened as an idea occurred to him. <i>Ooh, that'll work,</i> the pup thought, giggling <i>Plus, it'll give me a chance to clear the air a little bit...</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing his throat, he sat up a bit straighter in his seat. \"Um, guys?\" he called out, waving an arm in the air to get their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Blinking, Kiba looked towards Hunter's voice. \"What's up?\" Naruto, though he was still shoveling what was left of his meal into his mouth, looked up at Hunter as well, privately relieved that the pup wasn't doing something obscenely cute (even if he was pretty damn cute by himself...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter rubbed the back of his head. \"Umm...I was wondering if you guys would wanna maybe do a final round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba raised an eyebrow. \"A final round?\" He looked over at Hunter's stuffed tummy. \"The bonehead and I could probably manage, but are you sure you can? I mean, you're looking pretty full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged. \"Yeah, I guess; but I still got some room left, so it's all good.\" The pup sighed. \"Plus, um...I figured it's only fair I give you guys another chance to beat me, since I kinda cheated.\" Hunter's ears wilted a bit. \"Sorry about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breath hitched a bit in both Naruto and Kiba's chests at that (even causing the former to swallow and stop eating, having learned from earlier), but they shook it off; rather than deliberately playing up his cuteness like he had previously, Hunter appeared genuinely apologetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was the first to speak up; straightening, he smiled warmly at the pup. \"Ah, don't sweat it,\" the blonde replied amiably. \"All in good fun, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba settled for a smirk that was, nonetheless, no less good-natured. \"Yeah, and it's not like a certain someone never pulled that on me when he was a pup...\" He looked meaningfully down at Akamaru, who gave his very best innocent 'Who, me?' look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sighed in relief. <i>Great, they're not mad,</i> the pup mused to himself, tail wagging. Speaking up again, he let a beaming smile spread across his muzzle. \"Great! How do sticky buns sound to you guys?\" Pulling a platter close to him (he'd identified it by its scent), he tugged the top off to reveal a truly massive mound of sticky buns, each drenched in sweet, sugary glaze and absolutely covered in walnuts and raisins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, picking up the scent, had to keep himself from salivating. \"Sounds great to me!\" Eyes falling on two more platters, he pulled one towards himself and pushed one towards Naruto. The blonde uncovered the platter, revealing another truly massive mound of sticky buns. \"Oh wow, these look awesome!\" Naruto exclaimed, licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba took his platter's top off, revealing the same thing as Naruto and Hunter's. \"Yeah, and they smell awesome, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Hunter drew his plate closer to him, gleefully rubbing his paws together. \"Oh boy, these look so yummy...\" Looking up, he grinned. \"You guys ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded, a determined grin on his face. \"You know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked cockily. \"May the best man---er, or wolf-person---win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the \"win\" left Naruto's mouth, all three competitors grabbed a sticky bun in each hand and began taking massive bites out of them, demolishing them in two or three bites. Hardly stopping for breath, they grabbed two more each and all but crammed them into their mouths, chewing rapidly and savoring the sweet flavors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, meanwhile, sighed and settled back down. <i>Ah, great; at this rate, they're all gonna bust they're clothes...</i> the dog's face lit up as pieces of sticky bun fell to the floor, which he snapped up. <i>....but it's all in good fun, so I guess its fine.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three continued to cram sticky buns into their mouths....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All three continued to tear relentlessly into the mouth wateringly delicious sticky buns.  Each mouthful was a burst of flavor, as gooey cinnamon and frosting coated each bite, causing the boys and pups' faces to light up as they immediately and eagerly dug in for even more.  They were so good that the trio had almost begun to forget how much they'd eaten already....almost...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gang continued tearing away, Hunter paused and winced slightly, looking down and feeling his furry belly get a little snug as it bloated to the point where it had started pushing and compressing against the front of his constrictive shorts.  <i>Oooh, that smarts a little...</i> Hunter mentally griped, but did his best to shake it off and get back into the action, so as not to fall behind, or again use his natural cuteness as a distraction.  \"Oh, b-by the way, guys, there's still plenty of pitchers of nice, cool milk to wash these goodies down with, if ya want!\" he said in his still youthful and peppy but notably strained voice.  Luckily, the others were far too in the zone to take note of that and simply nodded, too enticed by the raw flavor each bite of the sticky buns had provided.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, it's like Ichiraku's...but STICKY bun-ified!\" Naruto exclaimed, happily wolfing down two buns, earning a giggle from Hunter, and a look of bewilderment from Kiba.  \"How?\" Kiba asked in a deadpanned manner.  \"Cause you're stuffing as much of 'em down your gullet as you possibly can?\"  Naruto snorted and responded with, \"No, dog-breathe, because this is the best dessert I've ever eaten...like Ichiraku's is the best ramen I've ever-ah whatever!  You get my point!  These things taste awesome!\"  Kiba chuckled.  \"Heh, for once, I couldn't agree more, bonehead...\"  He then shoved a big heaping bun into his maw, happily chomping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, both Naruto and Kiba's bellies continued to expand outward and outward, forcing them to have to spread their legs apart just to give their gullets breathing room, as they pushed their chairs back even further to compensate for the ever increasing size of their stomachs, and keep from them getting wedged between the table.  Meanwhile, Hunter's bloated tummy continued to swell up, as his tanktop rose higher and higher, exposing more of his bloated furry gullet as it continued to swell up with a mixture of sticky buns and milk.  As it did, his stomach continued to press further and further against his shorts and zipper.  The pain was starting to get a little less than tolerable as he had to force himself to not whine aloud from the tightness it was causing his poor belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut things were going so fast, and he didn't want to throw a wrench into the mix or spoil the fun for the others.  He had to think fast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ideal thing to do would have been to unbutton his shorts and pull his zipper down to give his tummy some much needed breathing room.  Unfortunately, his stomach had bloated outward so much that to do so would result in a struggle that would, no doubt, cause him to fall behind, or worse yet, distract the others until one of them sought out to help the poor pup out.  And that simply wouldn't do either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pondered and ate at the same time, his stomach was continuing to bloat up more and more, pressing deeper into his button and causing further ache in the little anthro-wolf-pup's midsection.  In addition to which, however, he began to feel the button untether from the front of his shorts.  And as though a light bulb had gone off in the (currently) young pup's mind, he grinned to himself.  <i>Perfect!</i> he thought as he continued to scarf away.  Licking his chops of some bun remnants, he eagerly rubbed his paws together, and once again struggled to grab a hold of his pitcher of milk, which; luckily, hadn't distracted the all-too-occupied Naruto and Kiba as the two teens continued to stuff their craws with as much sticky bun bites as their cheeks could possibly fit, to the point where they occasionally looked like squirrels stuffing their cheeks with acorns.  Hunter then proceeded to tilt his head back and pull the pitcher of whole milk back up to his little muzzle, ravenously gulping away as tiny dribbles of milk leaked from either side of his fuzzy muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping one huge mouthful of milk after another, the pup winced as he felt more and more milk fill up his more than occupied belly, as it continued to swell and strain against his shorts.  Akamaru looked up and saw the sight, and before he could inquire as to what Hunter was doing, he immediately had a flash to the times he'd watched Naruto do the same thing when having an eating contest with Kiba, and as if a reflex, shook his head and smirked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah...you've definitely been spending way too much time with Naruto, pup...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hunter paid no heed to Akamaru's musing, and continued to chug away as the button on his shorts continued to untether more and more...all the while, still causing more strain on the pup's strained and distended belly, until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hunter's eyes flew wide open as a sudden, sharp pain shot through his belly. <i>Ooh....maybe drinking all that milk with a snagged button wasn't such a hot idea...</i> Coughing a bit, he shakily set the pitcher down on the table and leaned back in his chair, paws massaging the sides of his distended belly. He winced as more pain lanced through his midection. <i>Owww....my tummy hurts...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst his will, a tiny whine escaped his muzzle. It was too low for either Naruto or Kiba, still shoveling sticky buns into their maws, to really notice. Akamaru, however, lifted his head from the floors, ears perking. <i>Eh?</i> Getting to his paws, he stealthily made his way over to where Hunter was sitting. Looking up, he whined as he saw the pup cringing in discomfort, even as his paws ran themselves over his bare tummy. <i>H-Hunter? A-are you alright?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing, Hunter glanced down at Akamaru. \"D-don't worry, Akamaru,\" Hunter replied, giving a weak smile. \"I-I just gotta rest a little bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Really?</i> Akamaru woofed skeptically. <i>'Cause it looks like drinking all that milk gave you a tummyache.</i> His eyes flitted down to Hunter's button; though it had untethered somewhat from the front of his waist, it was still holding fast. <i>Does your button maybe have something to do with it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, still wincing, waved a paw dismissively. \"Akamaru, seriously, just gimme a second to get my second wind; I'll go right back to drinking the milk, I'll bust my button, and everything'll be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA startled yipe suddenly emitted from the little pup's muzzle as another bolt of pain, this one far more severe than the last couple, ripped through his belly. This time, Naruto and Kiba heard it; glancing up from their platters with their mouths full of sticky bun, their eyes widened as they fell upon Hunter in his seat. Gulping his mouthful down first, Kiba addressed Hunter. \"Akamaru, what's going on?\" he asked, wincing as he caught sight of Hunter. \"Is he OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter opened his muzzle to reassure Kiba that nothing was wrong, but Akamaru beat him to it. <i>He's got a tummyache, Kiba; he drank so much milk without unbuttoning his pants that he's hurting.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akamaru!\" Hunter exclaimed, eyes widening as he looked at the big dog. \"I told you, I'm fi---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, another bolt of pain, this one stronger than any that came before, stabbed through him. Yelping, he bolted upright, arms wrapping around his gut. \"Owww....\" Hunter whined. \"It hurts...\" To the others' alarm, he sniffled, and his eyes grew watery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped down his mouthful. \"H-Hunter?!\" he exclaimed, sitting upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter gave a strained smile. \"G-guys, I'm serious, just go back to---\" He winced again and clutched his belly even harder, a tear streaking its way down his fur. <i>Oh great, I'm crying?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba both moved to get up from their seats, but were quickly reminded of the size of their bellies; with how cumbersome they'd become, they'd more than likely end up taking a fall en-route to helping the pup, which would only make things worse for the poor kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens cursed inwardly; Naruto had only known Hunter for a couple of days, but he'd seen him to be a nice, funny, and considerate (if a little crazy) guy, who had gone to all this trouble just to make things fun and to make him comfortable. Kiba, though he'd only just met Hunter that day, found himself starting to take a bit of a liking to the guy. Neither of them liked the idea that they couldn't do much to help him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Akamaru perked up. <i>Wait, I have an idea.</i> Why hadn't he thought of it before? He turned to Hunter. <i>Hunter, I want you to burp.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffling, and taking his glasses off so he could wipe his eyes with an arm, Hunter looked at Akamaru quizzically. \"H-huh? Whaddaya mean?\" The pup inquired, placing his glasses back on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked encouragingly, wagging his tail. <i>Just burp, loud and hard as ya can.</i> The dog winked. <i>Trust me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sniffed again. \"O-OK, but...\" His eyes suddenly widened as he realized what Akamaru was trying to tell him. \"Ohhhh, I gotcha,\" Hunter giggled, feeling his spirits lift a bit. Taking a deep breath, Hunter placed both paws on his belly and began kneading it, ignoring the resultant pain as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened. \"Hunter, what are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Naruto.\" At the dog-nin's comment, Naruto looked over at him. Seeing that he had the blonde's attention, Kiba smirked. \"He's got this.\" He winked at Akamaru, who wagged his tail in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving Kiba a grateful look, Hunter continued to knead his belly, wincing at the pain but continuing, as he felt the pressure slowly build up in his stomach. Greater and greater it grew, and harder and harder Hunter kneaded his belly, until, finally, the pup opened his mouth wide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BURRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and let loose with a surprisingly loud belch for someone of his size and (current) age. His belly vibrated rapidly, and, inevitably, his button finally gave, bursting off the front of his pants with an audible POP and flying over the table, impacting into the wall and bouncing off it, clattering to the floor. Exhaling, Hunter let his arms flop to his sides, and he sank into his seat. \"Phew....that feels so much better...\" the pup muttered happily, grinning goofily and letting his tongue loll out the side of his muzzle. At the moment, he didn't particularly care that his fly had opened a bit, enough to expose a bit of his red undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba gaped at the sight of the little wolf pup slumped back in his seat, seemingly basking in his relief. \"...wow,\" Naruto spoke up. \"That...that's one way to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Hunter agreed, forcing himself to sit up again. He turned to Akamaru, beaming. \"And it's all thanks to Akamaru.\" And, before he realized what he was doing, he leaned over and hugged the big dog's neck exuberantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba's eyes widened at the sight, dumbfounded. Akamaru, especially, froze. <i>Uh....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his eyes, Hunter realized what he was doing. Blushing furiously beneath his fur, he quickly released Akamaru's neck. \"S-sorry about that,\" Hunter stuttered, rubbing the back of his head sheepishly. \"I was just so happy, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was brought up short as Akamaru stepped forward and gave him a great, big lick across the face. Backing up, he barked in amusement as he saw that he'd knocked Hunter's glasses askew and mussed up the fur on his head. <i>You're welcome.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he'd properly processed what had happened, Hunter giggled and adjusted his glasses. \"Aww, Akamaru...\" Giggling, he fixed up the fur on top of his head as best he could. Suddenly getting an idea, he reached out to his plate and seized a sticky bun. \"Here ya go; a little token of gratitude.\" He tossed it toward the big dog, who snapped it up in his jaws. <i>Oh wow, these are really good,</i> Akamaru mused, gulping it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter giggled at the sight, before turning his attention back toward the humans. \"Sorry about that, guys,\" he laughed. \"Didn't mean to break up the flow or anything...\" He grabbed a sticky bun in each paw. \"...but there's no reason we can't get back into it!\" With that, he crammed both into his hungry little muzzle, chewing with a huge smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to be outdone, Naruto and Kiba grinned competitively but good-naturedly at the pup and at each other, right before they, too, grabbed more sticky buns and began cramming them into their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of all this, Akamaru wagged his tail, smiling a doggie smile. <i>Phew...crisis averted.</i> Trotting back over to Kiba (and receiving a ruffle on the head in the process), he sat down and settled in to watch the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three continued stuffing their faces, and occasionally taking a drink of milk to wash it down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Akamaru watched with some semblance of amusement as the trio dug deeper and deeper into their trays of sticky buns, occasionally lapping up remnants scattered from the feeding frenzy, or occasionally fed by one of the three.  The sheer volume of food consumed had taken quite a staggering tole on the trio and their ever expanding bellies.  Both Naruto and Kiba fared about the same, with both their globular guts practically sagging onto their laps and spreading out further and further.  Little Hunter's tummy had swollen outward so much that it almost looked as if the pup had swallowed an extra large beach ball.  His tanktop had risen well above his furry navel by several inches.  Incidentally, the more he ate, the tighter the middle of his stomach felt.  Not a painful tightness like with his button, but a...peculiar tightness.  Specifically right against his belly button.  It was a rather unfamiliar feeling for the pup, but not one that warranted alarm.  And so, he disregarded it, and kept on eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for some time, with the trio occasionally stopping to catch their breath, massage their tummies, wash down the buns with some milk, or burp to relieve some pressure, and right back into the fray they went.  After a little while, both Naruto and Kiba would occasionally glance down at their middle, feeling that odd pressure as well.  Hunter caught this and asked, \"Everything alright, guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, still fixated on his own midsection as he massaged it gingerly.  \"Y-yeah, just feeling some weird pressure in my gut,\" Naruto replied, earning a nod of agreement from Kiba as he examined his own vastly distended belly.  \"Same here,\" he added.  Hunter giggled to himself and added, \"Me three.\"  And in unison, an impish grin grew over both the teens and pup's faces as all three knew exactly what that universal feeling meant.  <i>Haha, ohhhh, this is gonna be EXTRA epic...!</i> Hunter mused internally, as he rubbed his paws together.  \"Soooo, whadduya suppose we outta do about this?\" Hunter asked the two (currently) elder boys.  Kiba nudged Naruto slyly, as the blond grinned and replied, \"Well...I dunno about you guys,\" he then grabbed his pitcher of milk, and licked his lips, \"but this weird feeling's gonna distract me til I do something about it.  How about you, Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned and grabbed his own pitcher of milk.  \"Took the words right outta my mouth, bonehead.  What about you, H-\" before Kiba could finish, he saw that Hunter was already grabbing another fresh pitcher with both paws, again struggling to pull it up.  \"I don't think my tummy has ever been that bloated before for that to happen,\" he replied.  Both Naruto and Kiba smiled assuredly at the already eager pup, as Naruto noted, \"To be honest, it feels kinda funny at first...but...in a good way, y'know?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like, tingly...then after a little bit, it's like a huge relief, since it eases soooo much pressure from your stomach in one sudden pop,\" Kiba added, earning a giggle from Hunter as the image resonated in his younger mind.  Then, his grin grew a bit more mischievous as he suggested, \"How about we make it interesting then?  Let's see which one of us can bust first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens grinned, all too eager to take the pup on his little challenge.  \"Hehe, sounds good to me,\" Kiba replied.  Naruto nodded and grinned competitively.  The trio then held their pitchers up in a 'cheers' fashion, and in unison, all three began chugging vigorously.  Akamaru simply watched, smirking to himself as he observed the sight, and watched as the three bloated bellies continue to swell up like water balloons being filled up with water...or in this case, ample amounts of whole milk.  Then, another thought entered Akamaru's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ohhhh, please don't let me start batting around at their belly-buttons...this has been a weird enough day already...the last thing I need to add is a big helping of embarrassment to that list...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Akamaru watched the three youths chug away, almost anxious to see which one of them would go \"pop\" first, as Kiba so 'delicately' put it...</span></div></div>",

Their eyes were narrowed in concentration, only taking the briefest of breaks to breath before resuming their guzzling. All the while, their stomachs continued to inflate, and the pressure around their navels slowly increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter had to struggle not to giggle as his stomach continued to grow, and the pressure against his belly button increased. It was a peculiar sensation, that was for certain, but again, it was far from painful, or even unpleasant. <i>Hee hee, getting close, I think; pressure's building...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to 'pop' first, Hunter leaned back in his chair and lifted the pitcher higher, pouring the thick, creamy milk at an even faster rate down his waiting gullet. As a result, his stomach began swelling faster, and the pressure in his navel increased even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup winced, even as he downed the milk at an alarming rate; even if it wasn't painful, the pressure was beginning to get a little uncomfortable, and his stomach was starting to feel extremely full and stretched. <i>Probably how a balloon feels right before it bursts,</i> Hunter thought to himself. Ironically, this gave him the drive he needed to keep drinking; after all, if his belly was starting to feel this tight, he probably didn't have much further to go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaster and faster the milk flowed, and tighter and tighter his stomach began to feel. Hunter winced again, but forced himself to continue. <i>Almost...there...</i> Bigger and bigger his stomach grew, and tighter and tighter the pressure became. Eventually, his ridiculously distended midsection felt as though it would bust with the tiniest provocation. Wagging his tail and smirking, Hunter took one last gulp of the milk, plunked the pitcher down on the table, and as that last mouthful entered his already-swollen belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...the pup felt a sudden, almost explosive release of pressure around his navel, followed by a rather strange sensation. He raised an eyebrow quizzically. \"Huh, my tummy's feeling kinda tingly...\" he said aloud, looking down at his globular gut. Naruto and Kiba, despite the growing pressure in their own navels, set their pitchers down to look at the pup...and their eyes promptly widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, preoccupied with looking at his own stomach, nonetheless mirrored their expressions. Instead of the fuzzy little pit of a belly-button he'd had all his life, he now had a rather noticeable, fur-covered nub sticking out from the center of his overstuffed tummy. <i>Wow,</i>, the pup thought, still staring at his navel. <i>My belly button actually popped out...</i> Curiously, he reached a finger out and wiggled it a bit. At this, a feeling that could only be described as both ticklish and tingly erupted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and the pup promptly burst into a fit of giggles. \"Heehaha! That feels funny!\" Still giggling, he retracted his paw, grinning widely as he saw his distended navel still wobbling about. \"Lookit the way it's wobbling! It looks so funny!\" He reached his paw toward his navel again and continued to wiggle it, burst into even more raucous laughter as the tingly/ticklish sensation once again permeated his belly. \"Haha! Oh man, this feels great!\" His tail wagged rapidly behind him, and his legs kicked rapidly (or as best they could, given his practically beach ball-sized belly). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he stopped giggling and took a deep breath to compose himself...and his eyes lit up. \"Oh, wow!\" he exclaimed, placing both paws on either side of his fully-exposed belly. \"You guys were right; there's practically no pressure anymore!\" Beaming so wide his eyes squinted shut, he began shaking his belly (and navel along with it), giggling through his teeth as he continued to kick his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kiba, and Akamaru, for their part, could only gape at the anthro wolf-pup, happily playing with his overstuffed belly, only stopping to wiggle his navel. All the while, he giggled uproariously, appearing to have the time of his life. Through all of this, they could only think one thing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn it, is he <b>trying</b> to kill us?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Hunter settled down; retracting his arms from his belly, he slid back in his chair, folding his arms behind his head and tilting his head back. \"Oh man, that felt <i>great</i>,\" the pup exclaimed, sticking his tongue out the side of his muzzle. \"I really gotta do that more often!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, remembering himself, grinned. \"Heh; told ya.\" He looked over at the many sticky buns still left on Hunter's plate. \"By the way, are you done, or are you still gonna eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked, wagging his tail. \"Yeah, buuut I think I'll wait a few minutes.\" He winked at the two. \"I wanna see the show, first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took Kiba a moment to realize what \"the show\" was, and grinned. \"Heh, sounds good.\" He turned to Naruto. \"Whaddaya say, dummy? I dunno about you, but I don't wanna disappoint the kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked in response. \"Took the words right outta my mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning at Hunter, then at each other, they each grabbed their pitchers of milk and resumed guzzling. Hunter, even as he leaned back in his chair, watched the two boys with rapt attention. As he did so, he wiggled his navel again, giggling a bit at the tinglish (tingly/ticklish) sensations. <i>Heh heh, this is fun!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two ninja were drinking at a rather rapid pace, it wasn't long before...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a notable strain on the faces of both young ninjas, but neither one was willing to lose to the other, and both could feel that the pressure that building up more and more, signifying that the end of their little venture was inching nearer and nearer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they chugged their respective pitchers of milk, as that odd tension in the middle of their bellies grew greater and greater.  Both teens occasionally glared at each other a bit competitively, and then shortly after, lifted their pitchers up higher as they tilted their heads back more to accommodate as gravity forced more milk down their throats at a quicker rate.  Like with before, a bit of milk would trickle down either side of both their mouths, but they paid no heed, and opted to keep going, even as the pressure became greater and greater...until finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn unison, both boys flinched as their navels each inverted to outies at the same time, wobbling outward comically from their greatly rounded bellies.  Hunter giggled hysterically as he began to happily clap his paws together.  \"Haha, oh wow!  I didn't think they'd both come out at the same time!  That was totally epic!\" cheered the little pup eagerly.  Even Akamaru couldn't help but snicker at the comical sight, or turn of events that led to said sight.  <i>I really shouldn't be surprised that they tied.  Again.  Literally, no matter how hard these two try, they're always toe-for-toe in any competition they have against each other...ever....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Naruto and Kiba set their pitchers down and sighed great sighs of relief as they gasped for breath and leaned back in their chairs, resting their arms atop their tummies, causing them and their inverted navels to bounce a bit.  Giving his gut a hearty pat, Kiba belched loudly and wiped his mouth with his forearm.  \"Phew!  Oh man, I forgot how much of an actual relief that is on a fuller-than-full stomach!\"  He then grinned to himself and saw that Naruto, rubbing his belly gingerly with both hands as his own belly button had popped as well, and judging from the reception they were receiving from Hunter and Akamaru, it was safe to assume neither one beat the other.  \"Lemme guess...we tied...<i>again</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked in acknowledgement, as Hunter giggled and chirped in, \"Yup!  Sure did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, ahhh whatever.  Least you enjoyed the show,\" Kiba responded, giving the pup a wink.  Naruto nodded in agreement, and was about to respond, but froze up as he felt a rush of warmth rising up his throat, and as soon as he opened his mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRAAAAAAAAPPPPPP!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto accidentally let out a massive, queasy sounding belch, causing his belly and inverted navel to wobble from the sheer force, much to Hunter's amusement.  When it was done, Naruto chuckled sheepishly as Hunter burst into a fit of childish giggles.  \"Heh, s'cuse you, bonehead,\" joked Kiba as he playfully nudged the bloated blond's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I don't think I've ever drank that much milk in my entire life,\" remarked Naruto, stifling another burp as he soothingly patted his stomach.  Clearing his throat, he smirked with a hint of relief on his face and looked back at his platter of sticky buns still remaining.  \"Well, I dunno about you guys, but all that belly-button popping and burping's left my gut with room to spare...\" said Naruto as he grinned back at the two and added, \"Whadduya say we polish the rest of these bad boys off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sat up right, (best as he could, given his comically bloated tummy), rubbed his itty bitty paws together eagerly and licked his muzzle.  \"Sounds yummy!\"  Kiba also grinned and said, \"Yeah, I guess I got some room now.  Who knows?  Maybe this time, I'll actually beat you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glanced back at him a bit more competitively as he grinned confidently and said, \"Guess we'll see...\"  He then turned his attention back to Hunter and a bit more playfully, added, \"All I know is, I'm watchin' out for this lil fella.  He already put away all his eggs and bacon first, <i>and</i> popped first!\"  Kiba turned his attention onto the pup and nodded in agreement.  \"Fair point, bonehead...fair point.  If we're not careful, this kid might top us three times in a row...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hunter just giggled and rubbed the back of his head bashfully, and said, \"Awww, you guys are too much!  Luckily, it's anyone's game!\"  Both teens nodded eagerly as they turned their attention to the buns.  \"Well then, may the best man...or wolf-person win!\" added Naruto, and like before, with the word win, all three immediately dug right into the remainder of their respective sticky buns, each one grabbing a pair and wolfing them down with newfound vigor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, their swollen bellies and inverted navels wobbled with each bite and motion, earning a snicker from Akamaru as he found his paw reaching outward, as if swatting at the wobbly appendage...and immediately, he stopped and put his paw down, flushing with embarrassment beneath his white fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Smooth, furball....reaaaal smooth...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on, the trio ate and ate, as they began to steadily deplete their platters, occasionally stopping to catch their breath or wash down the buns with whatever milk they each had left in their pitchers, until finally...</span></div></div>",

In spite of himself, the dog found himself watching intently; whatever the outcome was, it was gonna be close. Evidently, the same thought ran through the minds of the boys and pup; throwing determined, competitive grins at one another, they each reached out toward their plates, grabbed them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and proceeded to tilt them back, dumping the remaining few buns into their waiting maws. Akamaru gaped for a moment before shaking his head. &lt;i&gt;Yyyyyyyyeeeaaahhh, not really surprised at all...&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming their plates back down, the three chewed their massive mouthfuls as hard as they could. When that failed to get them down to a swallow-able size, they seized their pitchers, hoisted them up, and proceeded to pour as much into their mouths as they could, heedless of the milk that splattered around them. Their cheeks, already bulging with the contents of the remaining buns, swelled out even more as more and more milk entered them. Akamaru watched, dumbfounded, as they kept at it, despite the obvious discomfort on their faces. &lt;i&gt;Oh man....they better swallow soon, or we're gonna have a big mess on our hands...or paws...&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, just when it looked like their cheeks had reached maximum capacity, Naruto, Kiba, and Hunter steeled themselves and took a mighty gulp, somehow forcing the mass of chewed-up sticky bun and milk down their throats, causing them to wince as they did so. Letting the now-empty pitchers clatter to the table, the three leaned back in their chairs, put their hands on their comically overstuffed tummies, and let out a loud, satisfied belch each...before their eyes blinked open, and they looked across the table at each other, their eyes wide. Akamaru, realizing what had just happened, shook his head, wagging his tail. &lt;i&gt;Yeah, not surprised by that, either...&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto (big surprise) was the first to speak up. \"Um...was it just me, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Kiba spoke up, patting his belly heartily and causing it and his inverted navel to wobble. \"We all finished at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Hunter, rubbing his tummy and looking down at the overstuffed, furry appendage, giggled as his ministrations caused his belly to slosh a bit from his ministrations. \"Heh, imagine that, huh?\" He beamed, looking up at the two. \"You guys musta been real determined to beat me, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scowled playfully. \"Yeah, rub it in, why don't ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter tilted his head. \"Hey, I was trying my hardest to make it three for three; I was going all-out, too.\" He beamed again, wagging his tail. \"I'm impressed, guys; really.\" Then, to their surprise, he curled one of his paws into a fist and reached it across the table. Getting his message immediately, the boys smiled and bumped their fists with his. \"Good game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Heh, same to you, little fella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter giggled. \"Aw, thanks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the little pup tilted his head back, letting loose with a massive yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled, even as he felt his own eyes beginning to droop a bit. \"Heh...tired, Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded, licking his muzzle. \"Heh, yeah.\" He give his midsection a hearty pat with both little paws. \"All the food that's packed in my tummy's makin' me feel a little sleepy.\" His eyes lit up. \"But, before I doze off...\" Reaching to his side, he seized one of the vials of green fluid, uncapped it, and knocked it back, much as he had done earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kiba, and Akamaru's eyes all flew wide open. \"H-Hunter?!\" Naruto exclaimed. \"What are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter waved a paw dismissively. \"Relax; this lovely little concoction doesn't regress you past this stage.\" He beamed. \"All it does is tack on more hours to how long it lasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba gave the pup the stinkeye. \"And you didn't tell us this because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned impishly. \"Where's the fun in that?\" The pup giggled, kicking his feet a bit. \"Besides, I don't wanna go back to normal while I'm sleeping and rip these clothes.\" Before Kiba or Naruto could respond, Hunter yawned again, this time more widely than before. \"Mmm...better go lay down before I fall asleep in the chair.\" Turning himself around and supporting his tummy with both arms, he hopped down from the chair. As soon as his legs/back paws hit the floor, he stumbled and staggered, the weight of his engorged belly threatening to pull him down. Luckily, he was able to right himself. Sighing in relief, he waddled over to the futon he'd slept on the previous night, turned around so his back was facing it, and promptly flopped backward, his his belly wobbling as it surged up into the air. Splaying his arms out to the sides, he smiled, shut his eyes, and took a deep breath. Within a matter of seconds, the gentle, rhythmic movement of his belly expanding and contracting with his breathing signified that he'd fallen asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba smiled warmly. \"Awww...look at him,\" Naruto said, his chest warming as a blissful smile spread across the sleeping pup's muzzle. \"He looks even cuter like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's eyes widened as the pup opened his mouth and unconsciously put the thumb of one of his paws inside it. \"Y-yeah...\" Without taking his eyes off Hunter, he pounded his chest a little bit, sighing in relief as he felt his heartbeat resume its normal rate. \"He is...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to shake off the odd look Naruto was giving him, Kiba yawned widely, stretching his own arms. \"Well, he definitely has the right idea; I could go for a nap about now.\" Grabbing his belly with both arms, he staggered off his chair. Akamaru, taking the hint, trotted off towards the opposite side of the bed and plopped down. Nodding and smiling at his buddy, Kiba made his way over to the dog, practically sinking into a sitting position and leaning against him once he'd reached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, also yawning, cradled his belly in the same fashion and waddled toward the bed, flopping onto his back once he reached it. \"G'night...or morning,\" Naruto mumbled, closing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded, also letting his eyes shut. \"Whatever...see ya in a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a matter of minutes, all the occupants of the room were fast asleep, sleeping off their massive meals. Naruto snored loudly, a bit of drool tracing a line down the corner of his mouth. Kiba was leaning against Akamaru, his arms lain along the dog's body as though he were a bench. Hunter, still smiling in his sleep, had one arm sticking out the side, while the other was held close to his chest, sucking his thumb without a care in the world. All of their bellies gurgled as they began to digest the massive quantities of food they had ingested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked down and scratched his stomach, feeling it had shrunken considerably since the hours prior.  \"Least I can actually move around this time,\" Kiba joked groggily as he turned his attention to Naruto, who was still sprawled on his own bed, snoring like a goon.  Laughing to himself, he nudged Naruto awake, causing him to groan and grumble in annoyance.  \"Hey, wake up, you living noise box,\" Kiba said, still tired.  Eventually, Naruto mumbled in annoyance and eventually woke, stretching back as he yawned heartily, rubbing his eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked, despite his own tired state.  \"Morning to you too, sunshine.\"  Naruto just nodded, barely conscious, then rubbed his stomach absent mindedly.  \"Ohh man, did I need that,\" Naruto said, lifting up his shirt, to see his own stomach had also shrunken to little more than a small little bulge in his lower belly from the sheer volume of food consumed.  Dropping his shirt back down, he smirked and asked, \"So how's the little champ holding up?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, both boys turned and immediately, went doughy eyed as they say Hunter nuzzled snug atop his bed, with his little paw covering his face, but not enough to hide a puppy smile across the little fella's muzzle.  Naruto nudged Kiba and grinned, \"Holdin' up okay there, Kiba?\"  Kiba cleared his throat, trying his best to keep a tough image up.  \"Huh?!  Eh-er, y-yeah!  Why wouldn't I, bonehead?  A-anyway, we better wake him up before that formula of his wears off,\" Kiba responded, doing his best to maintain composure.  He then saw Hunter's blissful state, and again, his heart started melting.  <i>Awww, I almost feel bad waking him up when he looks so freakin' peaceful'n cuddl-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...D-did I almost just say cuddly...?\" Kiba muttered to himself...forgetting he was thinking that, and not saying that, and subsequently, earning a raised eyebrow and bewildered gaze from Naruto, who turned to him and in a deadpanned voice, asked, \"...did you almost say what now?\"  Coughing nervously, Kiba regrouped and said, \"Eh, h-hey, the longer we wait, the sooner his formula might wear off!  You want round two of streaking wolf person in full adult form, bonehead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Naruto grimaced, realizing Kiba had a point.  So, much as he'd have loved to continuing hazing the dog-nin, the two stepped over towards the little wolf pup, just glancing down at the little fella for a few seconds longer, until Kiba; being the dog-nin and canine expert, gently nudged the little pups' shoulder.  \"Rise and shine, sleepy.\"  After some doing, Hunter's eyes fluttered open as he squinted up at the two (currently) older boys and smiled happily; albeit tiredly.  \"Mmmph, mornin', fellas!\"  Hunter beamed as he sat up and stretched his little arms up, and as if on reflex, yawned a youthful high pitched puppy yawn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Kiba was already smiling like a dope at the sight, but hearing that just too much for the young dog-nin, try as he might to maintain a tough-guy image, particularly around Naruto, but upon hearing that cute little sound, as if a reflex, Kiba said... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwwww....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto started snickering.  \"Wow, Kiba, hehe, I knew you were a big softy, but...wow...\"  Hunter, on the other hand, simply giggled childishly and rubbed the back of his head bashfully.  \"Awww, hehe, you're too much, Kiba!\"  Hopping out of bed, Hunter examined his own tummy, and discovered it had shrunken a hefty amount, due to his much faster metabolism, to the point that there was little more than a tiny barely noticeable bulge contained beneath his tanktop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if on cue, said pup's tummy then growled hungrily.  Followed swiftly by both Naruto and Kiba's stomachs.  \"Hehe, sounds like the three of us can use some breakfast in our tummies to top the day!\" Hunter exclaimed, happily patting his tummy with both paws.  To Kiba's surprise though, a thought had occurred to him, which he felt compelled to address...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooooo, lil fella...I guess that potion stuff-err-whatever's gonna be wearing off fairly soon, right?\"  Looking away and rubbing the back of his head almost embarrassed, he asked, \"...You gonna be taking another hit of that stuff, or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter thought for a moment...</span></div></div>",

With a \"hup!\", he clambered up onto the chair, grabbed one of the vials, and uncapped it. Before tilting it to his mouth, though, he smirked at the two boys. \"You sure you guys don't wanna try? It'd be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed, rubbing the back of his head. \"Aw, thanks, little fella, but, uh, I might hold off on it for a bit.\" He smirked back at the pup. \"Still hafta get used to the idea, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged. \"Fair enough.\" He looked toward the blonde. \"Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde laughed, folding his arms behind his head. \"Ehhh, I'm with Kiba; being a kid again could be fun, but I'm still a little weirded out by the idea.\" The boy laughed again, but this time, Akamaru, Kiba, and Hunter's eyebrows all raised. Something about the laugh was oddly...forced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to think on it later, Hunter smiled. \"Alright.\" Licking his chops, he raised the vial to his muzzle and knocked it back. Letting it clatter to the table, he licked his chops again. \"Still, I got plenty of that stuff left; not just here, but in my bag too.\" The pup beamed, wagging his tail. \"If ya change your minds, don't hesitate to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>C-can I try?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's eyes widened at the sound of Akamaru's voice. He looked towards his buddy, giving him a surprised glance. \"A-Akamaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru shrugged his shoulders. <i>I dunno; I guess just seein' how energetic and playful he is like this just kinda reminded me of what it was like when I was a pup, and you were still in the Academy. I was just kinda curious to see what it'd be like to be a pup again.</i> The dog whined a bit. <i>St-still, if you don't think it's a good idea...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Kiba ruffled his pal's head. \"Aw, go for it, Akamaru!\"  He smiled as he saw the dog's eyes widen and his tail wag. \"Only reason me and the dummy aren't doing it's 'cause we ain't ready just yet.\" He smirked. \"No reason you can't give it a go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened as they focused on Kiba and Akamaru. \"W-wait, Akamaru's actually gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Kiba answered, giving his pal an encouraging pat on the back. Giving a grateful bark, Akamaru licked Kiba's hand and trotted over to Hunter, tail wagging eagerly. A huge grin split the pup's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attaboy, Akamaru, that's the spirit!\" Grabbing one of the vials, he uncapped it and motioned for Akamaru to sit down. The giant dog obliged, to which Hunter grinned even wider. \"Alright, Akamaru; now just open wide...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTail wagging eagerly, Akamaru tilted his head back a bit and did as he was asked, opening his maw wide. Giggling, Hunter then extended his arm and upended the vial over the dog's open mouth, emptying the whole thing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's tail wagged even faster as his tongue rapidly lapped up the liquid. Once the last of it had vanished down his gullet, he gave Hunter a grateful lick (eliciting a giggle from the pup) and trotted back over to Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba gave his buddy an expectant smirk. \"So, ya feeling anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru smacked his chops. <i>Not just yet, but it took Hunter a few seconds to...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog's responding bark was cut off by a startled whine. Concerned, Kiba asked, \"You alright, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru nodded. <i>Yeah; I just feel kinda funny...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had this left the dog's mouth than his body began to feel rather warm...and he felt himself slowly begin to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened. \"Wh-whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's own eyes shot open, tinged with concern. \"Akamaru?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, before their very eyes, they saw the massive dog slowly begin to grow smaller. His well-muscled limbs thinned and shortened, his entire body following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru looked up, and yelped a bit when he saw the room and its occupants beginning to grow. <i>W-wow...</i> Looking down at himself, he marveled as he grew smaller, his body losing the muscles and tone it had gained over his time as Kiba's partner. As he grew smaller and smaller, his eyes widened as the room seemed to grow even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba watched, awestruck, as Akamaru continued to grow younger, marveling at the sight, while Hunter merely rubbed his paws together gleefully and giggled. Finally, after about a minute or so, Kiba gaped at the sight before him; in place of the gigantic dog that had accompanied him was a tiny, white-furred puppy, much as he'd been during their first year in the Academy. Said pup looked up at Kiba, eyes widening at how much bigger his buddy seemed to have gotten, then slowly spun around in place, taking in the room and the furniture that now appeared positively monolithic. Then, he stopped, and gave himself a once-over. <i>I-I can't believe it...I-I'm actually a pup again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was the first to break the silence. \"Wow...never thought I'd see Akamaru like that again...\" A smile spread across his face. \"Almost forgot how cute he used to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving only a small nod in acknowledgement, Kiba knelt down so he didn't tower over Akamaru quite as much. \"Akamaru?\" Kiba inquired, examining his pal closely. \"How ya feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little pup looked up at Kiba, then down at the floor, internally debating. <i>Hmm...how do I feel...</i> Then, without warning, he felt a burst of something. Looking back up at Kiba, he took a breath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and let loose with a series of happy puppy barks. <i>Kiba, I feel <b>amazing</b>!</i> the puppy yapped, little tail wagging at breakneck speed. <i>It's... I dunno how to describe it!</i> Without warning, he darted to one end of the room, then the other, Kiba following his movement. A smile slowly broke out across the dog-nin's face. <i>I have so much energy!</i> he barked again, practically running in place. His butt began wiggling along with his tail. <i>Everything seems so fresh and bright! It's like I don't have a care in the world!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter giggled, hopping down from his chair and making his way back over to his duffel. \"Heh, it's great, isn't it?\" He shucked his broken shorts (revealing that he was wearing red boxers with multiple full moons plastered over it) and rooted through his bag, retrieving a pair tan khaki shorts and slipping them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Kiba's smile widened into a full-on grin. Not wasting any time, he extended his arms toward the pup. \"Aw, c'mere, Akamaru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hardly needed to be told twice; Akamaru sprang toward Kiba, aiming for his chest. The young dog-nin caught him, laughing joyously. \"Heh, lookit you!\" Still laughing, he stood back up, gently grabbed hold of Akamaru with both hands, and plopped him on top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed. \"Heh, never thought I'd see <i>that</i> again either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at Akamaru, Kiba smiled. \"Comfy up there, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru yipped happily in response, wagging his tail. <i>Really comfy! Man, this takes me back...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a rather audible growling cut through the air as Naruto, Kiba, and Hunter's stomachs made it known that they still needed food. Rather than blushing, the wolf pup trotted over to the three, tail wagging eagerly. \"C'mon, what're we just waiting around here for? Let's go get something to eat!\" Practically prancing toward the door, opened it, and promptly zipped out on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kiba, let's race him!</i> Akamaru barked excitedly, tail wagging. Laughing, Kiba nodded and took off after the pup (making sure to re-button his shorts, of course...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. \"Oh, no way you guys are beating me!\" Re-buttoning his own shorts, Naruto zipped out the door after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made it out of the inn...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eventually, all four make it to the park, panting and laughing amongst themselves.  \"Haha, ohhh man, I haven't done that in ages!\" gasped Kiba, earning a strained laugh from Naruto.  \"Tell me about it...forgot how much fun racing about was...don't think I've done it since I was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A kid?\" pepped Hunter gleefully as he rose to his feet (hind paws) and adjusted his glasses atop his muzzle, tail wagging vigorously as he did.  Naruto chuckled and rubbed the back of his fuzzy head.  \"Yeah, I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked happily.  <i>Still got it, eh, old man?</i>  Kiba just laughed, still trying to catch his breath, then reached atop his head to ruffle the little pup's head playfully.  \"Heh, I'm just glad you were able to hang on, boy!\"  Naruto grinned impishly and replied, \"Well, it's not like you were running THAT fast...\"  To which, Kiba turned and; with a sly grin himself, replied, \"Faster than YOU, bonehead.\"  Hunter snickered to himself, as did the pup atop Kiba's head.  Naruto, however,  immediately scowled and said, \"Hey, you guys had a head start!  If I had-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis griping was cut short when his stomach once again chimed in, reminding him how hungry he was.  Resting a palm against his stomach, Naruto chuckled and said, \"Ah, whatever...I'm too hungry to care.  Where do you guys feel like eating?\"  Hunter looked around, still trying to figure that out himself.  \"Good question...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kiba's face lit up.  \"Y'know, there's this steak joint not far from here!  I dropped by once...y'know, since they didn't seem to mind having a giant dog in the restaurant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, didn't mind...after a while...</i> Akamaru chimed in, earning a nervous chuckle from Kiba as he recalled the first time he recalled the faces of the wait staff and patrons seeing the young dog-nin and his gigantic canine companion drop by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-anyway, I was thinkin' about that place cause if memory serves, it's got a great discount for kids, and like this, I think you could get tons of way less than you would in your regular form...plus I'm really craving meat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's tail wagged at the idea as he smiled and said, \"Sounds like a great idea, Kiba!  And I think my wallet agrees with you!\"  As if to add to that, his tummy growled hungrily as he giggled and added, \"...and I guess my tummy thinks it's a great idea too!\"  Both Kiba and Naruto couldn't help but laugh at the remark, but nevertheless, they were starving...however, Naruto being Naruto...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up, guys.  I just thought of something,\" he said.  \"Say, Kiba, this is the place by that Sundae place, right?  Remind me again, how far is that?\"  Kiba shrugged and replied, \"Eh, probably about a five minute walk from here.  Why?\"  Naruto immediately grinned mischievously and answered.  \"Cause I think I just got my second wind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the word 'wind' left the boys' mouth, he was trailblazing off, much to the surprise of the others.  \"H-hey, no one said-\" before Kiba could finish, Hunter grinned, and sprinted off, before picking up momentum and prancing off on all fours.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru leaned down from atop Kiba's head and barked, <i>Well?  We griping or we racing?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to suppress a big competitive grin, Kiba chuckled and said, \"Hold on tight, boy...cause we're goin' for the gold!\"  And immediately, he charged onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio raced on, until reaching their destination, and the one who reached it first was...</span></div></div>",

Almost forgot what it was like to be in the passenger seat...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba chuckled, reaching a hand up and ruffling the dog's fur. \"Heh, well, since you seemed to be enjoying that formula, figured it was the least I could do to give ya a little taste of nostalgia...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba continued ruffling Akamaru's fur, Hunter came rushing up behind Kiba, still going full tilt on all fours. Eyes widening as he realized what was about to happen, the anthro-wolf pup dug all four paws into the ground, causing him to skid along the ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...right into the back of Kiba's legs, completely arresting his movement. Feeling this, the dog-nin looked down. \"Hey, the hell was...Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid pup yelped and fell backward, his glasses askew. Whining, he massaged his muzzle, wincing a bit. Somewhat concerned, Kiba turned around and knelt down. \"H-hey, you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill massaging his muzzle, Hunter sat up. \"Owowowowow....\" One paw still massaging his snout, he reached his other one up to his face to adjust his glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru raised an eyebrow. <i>Uh, Hunter...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, still rubbing his muzzle with both paws (having successfully adjusted his glasses), looked up at the dog-nin and his tiny partner. In spite of the ache in his snout, he managed a smile. \"Y-yeah, I'll be fine; a tender muzzle ain't the worst injury I've ever gotten.\" <i>That would go to that incident from a few years back...</i> He scowled a bit, even as he continued tending to his muzzle. <i>Ghirahim, you crazy bastard; no sense of personal space...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smiled, a bit relieved. \"Heh; if you're sure....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of a third set of feet approaching, Kiba looked up, smirking. \"Oh, hey, Naruto; nice of you to join the party.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEars perking up, Hunter turned his head and looked up as Naruto skidded to a stop beside them, panting as he bent over and rested his hands on his knees. \"Hi, Naruto!\" Hunter chirped as he removed his paws from his muzzle, the pain having mostly subsided. \"Little tired there?\" Snickering, he clambered to his hind paws, dusting himself off as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill panting, Naruto looked at the wolf pup and scowled. \"Sh-shut up...I-I just got done sleeping off a huge meal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Kiba smiled impishly, planting his hands in his pockets. \"So did we, dummy; didn't stop us from beating you.\" Akamaru barked his agreement, wagging his tail from his perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Hunter folded his arms behind his head. \"Heehee, and to think you got a head start, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes flying open Naruto stood upright and pointed angrily at Hunter. \"Oh, what are you so damn smug about, wolf-boy? You came in second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned, sticking his tongue out at the blonde. \"But I still beat you. Nyeh nyeh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A vein bulged in Naruto's forehead. \"Why you...!\" Opening his eyes, Hunter yiped at Naruto's expression. A bit shocked at just how worked up Naruto had gotten, he stepped back, taking a breath in through his nostrils...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and immediately froze, eyes widening. \"Whoa...\" he muttered. His alarm forgotten, he turned toward the source of their smell, which happened to be their destination. Blinking, he lifted his muzzle to the air and took another whiff, causing his tail to start wagging. \"Mmm....smells great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing exactly what Hunter was smelling, Kiba turned toward the building-a decently sized establishment, all told-and did the same. \"Oh yeah...this is the place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, yipping happily, looked down at Kiba from his perch. <i>Kiba, Kiba, can I get a steak too?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba scratched Akamaru's ears, causing the pup's hind legs to kick happily through his hair. \"Sure thing, pal!\" He turned toward the still-seething Naruto. \"C'mon, Naruto; those steaks aren't gonna eat themselves!\" Licking their lips (and muzzles) in anticipation, Kiba, Hunter, and Akamaru made their way through the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpluttering, Naruto tried to come up with some sort of retort. \"I--but---you---GAAAH!\" Grasping at his hair and gritting his teeth, the blonde barged in through the doors after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, he saw that Hunter was already talking to the waiter at the front desk. The man's eyes widened at the sight of the humanoid wolf pup, and even more so as they fell on the tiny pup resting on Kiba's head. He could have sworn the pup had been a full-grown dog the last time he and his Inuzuka partner had been here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, in spite of himself, snickered. <i>Heh, that guy doesn't know WHAT to make of this whole thing...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of his confusion, the waiter led the group to a rather nice-sized booth, took their initial orders for drinks (a bowl of water for Akamaru, and cola for the other three), and gone off to leave the three to pore over the menus. For a time, surprisingly, the three were quiet as they looked over the surprisingly extensive menus (except for Akamaru; he just elected to get whatever Kiba got.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the waiter returned. Sensing this, Naruto, Hunter, and Kiba all looked up from their menus. \"Well? Have you decided what you'd like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three looked at each other, grinned, and replied...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Every single bite is so juicy and yummy that it'll surprise ya with every bite!</i>  Both Kiba and Hunter chuckled at the pup's remark, which sounded like little more than happy puppy barks to Naruto, who just scratched his head and shrugged.  \"Eh, smells decent at least,\" he said with a half-hearted smirk, mind clearly a bit preoccupied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to sit, distracted while Kiba, Akamaru and Hunter continued to converse amongst each other.  Finally, after some pondering, Nauto turned his attention to Hunter, rubbing the back of his fuzzy head with a bit of embarrassment attached as he said, \"Look, Hunter, errr...about my little outburst earlier-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think too much of it, kiddo.  The bonehead there throws temper tantrums and hissy fits like that ALL the time,\" Kiba said, grinning impishly, as Naruto scowled angrily at the dog-nin.  \"I DO NOT, DOG-BREATHE!\" barked Naruto, earning a snicker from Kiba and some odd stares from the other patrons and wait staff in the restaurant.  \"I rest my case,\" retorted Kiba as he folded his arms and leaned back against the booth seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, cram a chew-toy in it,\" grumbled Naruto under his breath.  But nevertheless, he regained his composure and turned his attention back to Hunter, who tilted his little head curiously at the frazzled teen.  \"ANYWAY...I know you were just playin' around.  I shouldn't have acted like such a pissy jerk, or a poor sport, so...I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, the wolf-pup just giggled and smiled back at the boy.  \"Hehe, I'll admit, I was kinda surprised that you got as worked up as you did over an itty bitty game, but hey, you're only human, right?\" Hunter pepped, before giggling to himself and adding, \"Though, it WAS kinda funny, now that I think about it.\"  Kiba joined in on the laughter, and added, \"Still not as funny as him losing a race even after getting a cheap head start.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically fuming, Naruto glared at the smug dog-nin, doing his absolute best not to deck him then and there.  Luckily, Hunter chimed in once more and said, \"Bottom line, I'm just glad to be hanging out with you guys, cause it's been an absolute blast so far!\"  Easing up a bit upon hearing that, Naruto smirked and playfully nudged the wolf-pup in the shoulder.  \"Heh, yeah, I guess it has been hasn't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kiba caught a potent and sensational scent wafting nearer and nearer.  Immediately, he turned around, and his mouth almost instantly began to water.  \"Hohoho...and it's about to get even more fun,\" he said as the waiter returned and hefted over four 72 oz steaks, fresh and sizzling from the kitchen as he placed each one before the two teens, the wolf-pup, and a spot next to Kiba for Akamaru.  He then placed down a bowl of water for Akamaru and three pitchers of cola for the teens and Hunter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four simply sat in silence and marveled at the delicious smelling feast-to-come bestowed upon each of them, until; in unison, their tummies all growled, practically begging each of them to stop gaping and to start eating.  And with Hunter licking his chops, grabbing a fork and knife, and saying, \"Mmmm!  If this tastes as yummy as it smells...\" all four immediately began digging into their steaks, all utterly dumbfounded by the whirlwind of flavor bursting in their mouths with that first, gloriously juicy bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap...if THIS is steak...then...what the hell have I been eating my whole life?!\" gaped Naruto, still in awe.  Kiba simply grinned toothily, savoring the flavor in his bite as he gulped it down, and said, \"Told ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the four proceed to dig into their steaks, enjoying each and every sauce smothered bite.  And as time went on...</span></div></div>",

No doubt Naruto's assertion wasn't too far off... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>B-but...it's so yummy...</i> Akamaru whined, ears drooping. Seeing this, Kiba scratched his pal's back, smiling. \"Look at it this way, Akamaru;  once you polish that monster off, I'll give you a nice tummy rub.\" He laughed as Akamaru perked up a bit. \"Imagine how amazing it'll feel on a fuller-than-full gut...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmmm,</i> Akamaru mused, tail wagging. A stuffed tummy rub <i>would</i> feel great, no doubt about that. <i>Well, when ya put it like that...</i> Tail now wagging at full speed, he dove rigth back into his steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Hunter resumed cutting into his steak. \"Heh heh, he seems excited...\" Shoving a piece into his mouth, he chewed happily, legs kicking a bit as he did so. \"Don't blame him, though; tummy rubs on a full stomach feel great.\" With the piece still in his mouth, he cut an even bigger piece and forked it in, his cheeks bulging a bit as he chewed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, watching even as he ate his steak, smiled. \"Awww...look how happy he looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked at Naruto. \"'Course he looks happy; he's a kid eatiing some of the tastiest steak this side of the Land of Fire.\" He chewed, looking thoughtful. \"Who knows? Maybe I'll take a hit of that stuff later, see if I feel the same...\" He looked back towards his blonde friend. \"What about you, Naruto? You wanna spend a few hours as a kid later on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, Naruto's body went rigid at the question. It didn't escape Hunter's notice either; mouth still full of steak, he looked up at the blonde boy. \"Naruto?\" he inquired, his speech somewhat muffled by the meat. \"Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shook himself, and rapidly began cutting himself another piece of steak. \"Y-yeah, I'm fine; bit of steak just went down funny, that's all.\" He gave that strange, forced laugh again before shoving the steak into his mouth and getting to work on cutting another piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, Kiba, and Akamaru exchanged a confused, worried glance; what was going on with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, they weren't likely to get him talking; he was annoyingly stubborn. So, with more than a little reluctance, they dove back into their meals. Soon enough, they were once again savoring the flavors, but Naruto's odd behavior still nagged at the back of their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They couldn't enjoy themselves the way they were prior with Naruto's strange behavior nagging at them.  And Naruto was far from oblivious to their observations, and so he just continued tearing into his steak, almost like he was trying to look as busy as he could possibly be.  And that only made it harder for any of them to concentrate.  Hunter shifted his paws nervously, almost raising one to inquire as to what was going on with Naruto, but decided against it, in fear that it wasn't his place to ask or that Naruto would get mad at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Kiba was less tactful, as he found himself getting annoyed by Naruto's strange behavior and stubbornness to just be forward about what was ailing him.  And so, he dropped his fork and knife on his plate and shifted his focus square on Naruto as he glared in annoyance.  \"Alright, that does it,\" griped Kiba sharply, much to Hunter and Akamaru's alarm.  \"What the hell's going on with you?\"  Looking up nervously, Naruto cleared his throat.  \"Huh?  W-what're you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, will you cut it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, Naruto's attention shifted up to Kiba as he regained his composure and asked, \"Huh?  Cut what out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That!</i>  Every time Hunter or I bring up maybe using that special age formula, you start acting all weird and nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No I don't!\" responded Naruto, earning a scoff from Kiba and a nervous, uneasy laugh from Hunter.  \"Ehehe, hey, y'know what, guys?  It's okay, we don't have to talk about it now,\" Hunter chimed in as he attempted to ease the situation, but alas, it was to no avail as Kiba waved his hand dismissively.  \"I just wanna know why he's acting weird, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba, can you please just leave it alone?\" Naruto pleaded, earning a whine from Akamaru as he turned to Kiba and barked lowly.  <i>...Maybe you should let this one go, buddy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Kiba pressed the issue.  \"No, I'm tired of him acting like this and spoiling everyone's fun.  Just spill it, bonehead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you drop it?\" responded Naruto, a bit more sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop being so damn defensive, it's like-\" Kiba stopped mid-sentence, as a sly grin grew over his face.  \"Ohhhh, hehe, I get what's going on here.  You're afraid, aren'tcha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's it, isn't it.  Hehe, you're scared you're gonna get stuck like that, so whenever anyone brings up the formula thing, you start acting all weird and change subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhining a bit himself, Hunter's ears drooped as he saw Naruto's face darkening and his fists tightening against his form and knife firmly.  \"Uh, Kiba?  Maybe you should-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  I'm just telling the little baby that he shouldn't be such a damn chicken about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!!!\" barked Naruto angrily as he slammed his fists against the table, earning stares from other patrons and the staff, and silencing everyone at the table on the spot.  Taken back, Kiba raised an eyebrow, holding his arms forward in an 'calm down' motion.  \"Hey, hey, take it easy, Uzumaki!  I was just trying to see what the hell your problem w-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stopped as he inspected the angry young man's face a bit more carefully.  Naruto was still gritting his teeth angrily, seething with enough anger that Kiba knew if he said the wrong thing, he'd probably get decked.  But that wasn't what caught his attention.  It was Naruto's eyes.  He was pissed, to be sure, but, if Kiba didn't know better, he could swear that Naruto was getting a little misty eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Hunter and Akamaru caught it too, and shared a concerned glance, too nervous to say anything.  (Of course, in the latter's case, it wouldn't matter since Naruto wouldn't understand a word he was saying anyway.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Kiba's demeanor eased up as a look of concern for his friend grew over his face.  \"H-hey...you okay, man?\" Kiba asked.  But Naruto didn't respond.  Instead, he looked down, almost distantly, until finally, he said, \"...Do you know why I keep 'acting weird' whenever either of you bring up becoming a kid again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Kiba nor Hunter answered.  \"...It's because I never want to re-experience that part of my life ever again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his better judgement, Hunter turned to the blond boy and asked, \"But why not?  Being a kid's fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For <i>you</i> guys, maybe.  Tell me something...do you have any idea what it's like to be alone...in every sense of the word...?  To be neglected...feared...HATED...by everyone around you...for something that isn't even in your control...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, Kiba was kicking himself for being thoughtless enough to forget what a burden having the Kyuubi sealed within was for his friend, and how cruel and misunderstanding those in his village were to him as a result.  Glancing sympathetically, he tried to apologize.  \"N-Naruto, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And do any of you have ANY idea what it's like to carry all of that that on a day-to-day basis, and come home to an empty apartment...without anyone to lift that hurt off your shoulders...to care for or love you or...\"  Naruto had to catch his breath at that last statement, visibly getting choked up as he clenched his fists tighter while his head sank lower...but not low enough to conceal the tears now trickling down his cheeks.  \"...N-now...tell me...would ANY of you want to relive that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Oh God, I didn't even TOUCH his stupid formula...and I'm STILL crying like a damn baby...</i> Naruto griped mentally as he tried to calm down, to no avail.  <i>Stop...stop it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back at the others, Kiba got up and sat beside his friend, placing his hand atop Naruto's shoulder in a brotherly fashion.  \"Look, I-I'm sorry I was such a jackass...I didn't mean to bring all this back up...but y'know what?  You got it wrong.\"  Still tearing up, Naruto nonetheless turned his head towards Kiba, as did Hunter and Akamaru.  \"Yeah, the road was rough starting out, and no, I can't imagine going through the crap you went through.  I don't think any of us ever could.  And it could have completely ruined you...hell, no one would blame you if it did...but it <i>didn't.</i>  You didn't <i>let</i> it ruin you.  Know why?\"  Naruto shook his head as Kiba smiled warmly at his pal and said, \"Because you're one of the strongest people I've ever met.  In EVERY sense of the word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't know what to say.  He simply wiped his face with his forearm and just...sat there, almost dumbfounded by the remark.  But Kiba just grinned and continued.  \"Look at it this way; you faced hardships no kid ever should, and you still did everything in your power to work your ass off every single day and earn the respect of those around you.  You not only pulled that off, but even after basically being damned at childhood, you STILL manage to be a complete and utter goofball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that remark, in complete unison, an eyebrow rose from Naruto and both pups at the same time.  \"...Huh?\" was all Naruto could mutter as Kiba laughed.  \"Y'know, you're always cheery, you always got a positive attitude, and even if you can be a little bit of a dumbass sometimes...like...a really...REALLY dumb kind of dumbass-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If there's a point to this, you should probably hop to it and fast, buddy...</i> barked Akamaru, still a little perplexed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-My point is, you stay positive and good hearted about everything despite what happened.  You don't sit around feeling sorry for yourself.  You tough it out and put that stupid smile on your face every day.  And you know what?  You gotta be pretty damn tough to pull that off.  And like I said...they don't get tougher than you, bonehead,\" remarked Kiba finally as he playfully nudged his friend in the arm for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence passed.  Until finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, I guess it <i>did</i> kinda get easier over time,\" Naruto finally said, before glancing back at Kiba and, with a warm and grateful smile, adding, \"...cause eventually, I was lucky enough to have friends like you by my side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smiled a wide smile and again, playfully punched the blond's arm.  \"Ah, ya big sap...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Akamaru yipped happily as he hopped atop the table and trotted on towards Naruto.  <i>Friends like US, you big dope!</i>  He barked as he licked the boy's hand, causing him to laugh as he ruffled the little pup atop the head.  Hunter, meanwhile, watched the sight and smiled warmly himself, seeing how strong a friendship these guys shared.  Hell, who couldn't appreciate something like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, guys, I'm sorry I was acting all weird about this whole...de-aging thing, I should'a just been upfront and said what was bothering me about the whole thing,\" Naruto said, apologetically.  But Hunter simply waved his little paw dismissively and replied, \"No no, I'm the one who should be sorry.  I shouldn't have pressed on the issue since it was obvious from that painfully forced laugh that it made you uncomfortable.\"  Naruto chuckled sheepishly, recalling said laugh.  Nonetheless, Hunter beamed, \"But I only did so cause you're not reliving childhood itself...just the sensation and feel of being a kid again!  And who knows, maybe revisiting it could undo the sour taste it left ya the first time around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned and added, \"At the very least, this time around, you won't be alone, right?\"  Akamaru barked in agreement.  Suddenly a loud rumbling emanated from their tummies.  Giggling, Hunter rubbed his tummy eagerly and said, \"But that's enough'uh that!  Whadduya say we hop back to these tasty steaks?\"  Naruto grinned and turned back to the others.  \"You heard the kid, these things ain't gonna eat themselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, all four were once again going to town on their massive steaks, now a bit more joyously and eagerly than prior.  The two boys and two pups went at their large, juicy steaks relentlessly until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Aaaahhh,\" Naruto sighed happily, leaning back in his seat and patting his belly. \"Man, this steak's good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked, licking his lips to get a few morsels left on his face. \"Heh; told ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter leaned back, folding his paws over his tummy. \"Mmmm...can't remember the last time I had such a yummy steak...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru burped, sitting down and licking his chops. <i>Heh, and to think we're not even halfway through yet...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Akamaru had said, the four hadn't even gotten a quarter of the way through their monstrous steaks before they'd had to take a breather. However, thanks to the sheer size of the steaks, their stomachs were already starting to be affected. For Hunter, Naruto, and Kiba, this took the form of a barely-visible outline under their shirts. For Akamaru, this meant his stomach took on slightly less of a concave appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter burped, lifting his paws off his tummy and examining it. \"Oh wow...we're not even a quarter of the way through yet, and our tummies are already starting to grow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed, patting his belly heartily. \"That's nothing; you shoulda seen me the last time I ate one of these monsters...\" He smiled at the memory. \"I was practically using Akamaru as a crutch the whole trip home...\" The pup in question winced at the memory, but shook it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter clapped his paws, giggling at the mental imagery. \"Hee hee...if that's right, were' probably gonna hafta use each other as a crutch on the way back, huh?\" Naruto and Kiba laughed at this, while Akamaru just whined and shook his head. \"Still, that steak already has me parched.\" He grinned at the two. \"Dunno about you, but I could really go for a drink about now.\" Grabbing his pitcher of cola, he pulled it closer to him, lifted it up (his little paws once again struggling to keep a firm hold on it) and opened his mouth, allowing the cola to gush into his maw. As the cool, bubbly liquid flowed down his throat, his legs kicked happily, his tail wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Kiba looked at Naruto. \"Heh; kid seems like he has the right idea, Naruto.\" Licking his own lips, he grabbed his own pitcher and began guzzling the cola inside it. Not one to be outdone, Naruto began doing the same with his pitcher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru gaped at the three chugging away. Sighing a doggie sigh, he trotted over to his bowl, lowering his head. <i>Well, I guess I'm a little thirsty too...</i> the pup reasoned, beginning to slurp up his water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four went on like this for a minute or so, only stopping to take a breath. Soon, though, the two boys (and one anthro-wolf pup) lowered their pitchers and Akamaru lifted his head up from his bowl, their thirsts quenched for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto burped, grinning and licking his lips. \"Ahh, that hit the spot...\" Picking up his fork and knife again, he resumed cutting into his steak. \"Still, I don't wanna leave this steak sitting any longer than I need to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba picked up his own utensils. \"Heh; you've got a good idea for once, bonehead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Hunter resumed cutting pieces of his steak away. \"Eh, all I know is my tummy's still growling, and I ain't stopping till it shuts up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru wagged his tail, even as he dug his head into his oversize steak. <i>Music to my ears, Hunter; music to my ears...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four continued on like this for a few minutes, eagerly savoring every single bite. Naruto, though he was enjoying it just as much as the other three, had an oddly thoughtful look on his face as he ate. This was not lost on Hunter, who looked up from his own plate at the blonde. \"Naruto?\" the wolf pup asked, tilting his head quizzically. \"You OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled. \"Y-yeah; I was just thinkin' about what you said; about that formula getting rid of the sour taste the...\" his face briefly fell before it perked up again. \"...the first time around left.\" He laughed. \"And, well...I'm thinkin' that might not be such a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's face lit up. \"You mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, reaching across the booth to ruffle the anthro-pup's fur. \"Yep; I'm thinkin' I'll take a hit of that stuff later; gonna see what it's like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning and swallowing his mouthful, Kiba playfully punched Naruto in the arm. \"Heh, that's the spirit, Uzumaki!\" He winked at the other boy. \"Still, don't think you're gonna be leavin' me out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaming widely, Hunter resumed tearing into his steak. <i>Just you wait, guys; it's gonna be a blast!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly afterward, Naruto and Kiba returned to their own steaks, shoveling as much of the delicious meat into their waiting mouths as they could. And, as all four of them continued tearing into their steaks, their stomachs, slowly but surely, began to show the effects; the outlines under the two humans' (and one wolf pup's) shirts began to to thicken and round out, slowly but surely making more of an impression under their shirts. Likewise, Akamaru's tummy became less and less concave as more meat plopped into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they stopped for their next break...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All four had torn a fair amount from their slabs of steak, but nevertheless, there was still plenty left to go down.  And the more that went down, the larger the gangs' tummies grew.  For the boys and wolf pup, their bellies were now just barely contained beneath their respective shirts, having created a noticeable bulge in their middles.  And the little white furred puppy's tummy had started to bulge downward slightly, as if the little fella had swallowed a particularly large grapefruit whole.  (Which; for a tiny puppy, is fairly sizable.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time had passed, again the four had to stop and take a little breather...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter leaned back against his chair, patting his bloated tummy happily with both hands.  \"Phew!  72 ounces of steak is...a lot of steak, isn't it?\"  Kiba laughed, massaging his own belly with one hand while the other hung off his chair.  \"You better believe it, kiddo.\"  Eventually, he saw Akamaru sighing with relief as he pulled his little face from the large steak.  Laughing, he ruffled the pups head playfully with his free hand, causing him to yip happily.  He then turned his attention towards Naruto and asked, \"And what about you, bonehead?  How ya holdin' up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer his question, Naruto burped loudly, earning a few giggles from Hunter and a chuckle from Kiba.  \"Ah, <i>that's</i> how,\" he joked, patting his bloated belly with one hand.  He then looked down and glanced curiously at his waist, noticing something peculiar.  \"Hey, anyone else starting to feel a bit snug around the waist?\" he asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba examined his waistband curiously, as did Hunter.  \"Now that you mention it, maybe a little bit...\" remarked Kiba.  \"Mm-hmm, same here!\" chimed Hunter.  Akamaru just snickered to himself.  <i>I don't have any pants to make me feel snug, so there!  Though a tummy rub wouldn't hurt...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, thought for a moment, the grinned impishly.  \"Hehe, I think I have a fairly good idea what that means,\" he said, earning a curious glance from the others, until they both connected the dots and figured out what he was talking about.  Almost immediately after, both the wolf-pup and dog-nin had similar grins on their faces.  But then, Akamaru figured out what Naruto was talking about and whined before turning to Kiba and chiming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But if you bust your pants, that means all three of you will have to haul yourselves back to the hotel trying to keep your balance AND keep your pants from falling off!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's smile dropped as he realized his (currently) little buddy made a fair point.  He then turned to the others and said, \"Y'know, we're not at that room.  We're all gonna be preeeetty damn full when this is done.  It might be kind of a pain in the ass to trying to grip our pants when we're already gripping our guts, won't it?\"  Both Naruto and Hunter glanced down at their waists then at each other.  It was a fairly short distance because they had raced twice to get to the restaurant...when they're done...the LAST thing they'd do is race anywhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whadduya guys say?  Should we just play it safe and unzip and unbutton now while we can?\" Kiba inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pondered on that question for a brief moment, then decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hunter winced. \"Ya know, after the nasty tummyache I got when I tried busting my shorts, I think it'd be easier for me to just undo my shorts.\" Reaching his paws down, he began fumbling with his button, trying to work around his belly. Naruto, though he hated the thought of giving up, realized how damn embarrassing it would be if his shorts dropped en-route back to the hotel, and began doing the same, trying to get a good grip on the pesky button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shrugged. \"Eh, I guess it'd work out better that way...\" <i>Plus, I don't want everyone seeing the patters I have on my undies...</i> Akamaru wagged his tail as he saw the dog-nin begin to work on his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Naruto got a grip on his pants button, followed shortly by Kiba and Naruto. Smiling, he undid his button, as did his companions. As soon as the buttons were undone, their bellies bulged noticeably outward, hiking their shirts up a bit higher, just enough to show a sliver of flesh. Sighing in relief, they each grabbed their zippers and pulled them all the way down. Their stomachs pushed out the slightest bit, though not as much as when they'd undid their buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter let out a little sigh, rubbing his tummy. \"Aaaahhh..... that was a great idea....\" he suddenly let out a burp, which only caused him to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grumbled a bit, leaning back in his seat. \"Yeah, I guess...still woulda preferred busting my button...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked, massaging his own belly. \"Eh, look at it this way, Naruto; least ya won't be running around without your shorts on the way back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined, lowering his head. <i>Even if people can still see your undies through your pants...</i> His own stomach gurgled, and he looked down at it, wincing as he saw it was about the size of a grapefruit. <i>Uh, Kiba? Just so you know, I'm proooooobably not gonna fit on your head once we're all done...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the pup flush beneath his fur, Kiba laughed, scratching his tummy and causing one of the dog's hind legs to kick a bit. \"Eh, no problem; I'll just put ya in my shirt.\" In spite of his embarrassment, Akamaru yipped happily and licked Kiba's hand. \"Awww, there's a good boy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled at the sight...until something occured to him. \"Wait a minute,\" he spoke up, turning to Kiba. \"We said we were gonna take a hit of that formula later, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit surprised at the change in subject, Kiba nonetheless smiled. \"Yep; what about it? You're not havin' second thoughts, are ya?\" This last jstatement was said tauntingly, but with a hint of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto hsook his head. \"Nah; I was just thinking about the clothes situation.\" He gestured to the garments they were currently wearing. \"I mean, yo udon't look like you brought anything at all, and I've only got clothes back at the inn in the size I'm at now...\" He chuckled a bit, rubbing the back of his head. \"Dunno about you, but I don't feel like running around naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, even as he giggled at the imagery, spoke up. \"Well, that's no problem; if ya want, you can borrow some of my clothes.\" He giggled again. \"Always like to be prepared...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked, reaching across the table and ruffling the pup's fuzzy head. \"Thanks, Hunter, but ya don't need to do that.\" He winced a bit. \"Plus, uh...it might be a little weird, wearing someone else's clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged. \"Well, then, that's no problem; I'll just call up one of my contacts and have them pick up some clothes for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. \"You'd do that? Thanks a lot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru was a bit more skeptical. <i>Umm...what sorta contact?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter giggled. \"Ah, don't worry; she's reliable, even if she's got a bit of an attitude problem...\" Taking his phone out of his pocket, he dialed a number, held it up to his ear, and waited as it rung. Finally, when his contact picked up, he grinned. \"Hey, it's Hunter.\" His eyes widened. \"Why do I...oh. You remember that formula I showed you?\" His eyebrow raised. \"How can you know it's me?\" He grinned impishly, much to Naruto and Kiba's confusion. \"Weellll...last time we met in person, you got drunk and admitted you had a crush on Link.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of the three from Konoha could wonder who 'Link' was, they pulled back as they heard loud, unintelligible squawking emanating form the device. Wincing, Hunter pulled it away from his ear, wincing. \"Maaaybe that wasn't the best thing to say,\" he admitted to the others, laughing nervously. He waited a few moments until the squawking subsided a bit, then held it back up to his ear. \"Sorry, but you asked for proof...\" The voice at the other end of the line evidently replied, as Hunter groaned and massaged the bridge of his muzzle. \"OK, OK, I'm sorry!\" He sighed, shaking his head. \"A-anyway, could you do me a favor?\" Hunter waited a few moments before a relieved smile  broke out across his mujzzle. \"Yeah, could you pick up some clothes for a couple of 8-year-old boys?\" Hunter again went silent, and to Naruto and Kiba's alarm, he frowned. Was his contact refusing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Hunter smiled, lowered the phone and looked toward the two boys. \"Um...she wants to know what kinda clothes you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyebrows raised. \"What kind of clothes?\" He scratched the bakc of his head. \"Uh...it's a nice day, so tell her I'll just do short-sleeved shirts and some shorts.\" He looked toward his dog-nin pal? \"Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked, but nonetheless replied, \"Uhhh...just some pants and hoodies; I don't really care whether the hoodies are short or long sleeved...\" He laughed, scratching his cheek. \"...or if they're pants or shorts.\" His eyes brightened. \"Oh, and maybe a necklace with a metal tag; I've always liked those...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling and nodding, Hunter brought his phone back up to his ear and repeated the boys' requests. \"Ya got all that?\" he asked after he'd finished relaying the information. Evidently, his contact protested in some way, as Hunter groaned and replied, \"No, I don't think you're stupid; I just wanted to make sure you got all that.\" His contact apparently answered in the affirmative, as Hunter nodded and smiled. \"Awesome! Here's where we're staying...\" Hunter relayed their address, then fell silent for a few seconds until his contact affirmed that she'd gotten it. \"Great! Just, uh, pick the clothes up, drop 'em off at the room, and you can be on your way.\" Another few seconds of silence ensued, before Hunter beamed. \"Awesome! Thanks a million! You're a gem, Midna!\" Hanging up, he pocketed the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he finally spoke to the others, \"that takes care of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kiba, and Akamaru simply stared at him. \"Um....\" Naruto began, then fell silent, apparently thinking better of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisregarding this reaction, Hunter grabbed his utensils. \"Enough waiting around! We don't wanna let these steaks get cold!\" With that, he resumed digging into his massive ribeye. Kiba and Naruto, smirking, followed suit, with Akamaru burying his face back in his steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after they resumed eating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sure enough, all four were going to town on their hearty slabs of beef, with no end in sight.  The boys and wolf-pup were tearing out chunk after chunk of steak, stuffing one hearty forkful after another down their throats and enjoying the burst of flavor with each bite.  Little Akamaru's face seemed to almost never leave his steak as he bit deeper and deeper into the ribeye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more time had passed and the gang was still 'fighting the good fight' and doing so seamlessly.  And boy, was it starting to show...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Naruto and Kiba's bellies had bloated outward to the point where that sliver of exposed flesh beneath their shirts had increased as their shirts stretched outward more and more, to the point where the bottom of their shirts were just barely concealing their bellybuttons.  Hunter's own shirt continued to ride up as well, exposing more and more of his bloated furry tummy to where it was in about the same state as the boys, and with every couple passing gulps, their bellies would swell just ever so slightly and force down a few more teeth on their pants zippers.  And Akamaru's own tummy had rounded out to where it was sagging a good deal beneath his torso, to the point where he had to stretch his hind legs apart just slight to accommodate its' ever increasing form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still, the four youths continued soldiering onward, consuming more and more of their oh-so-delicious and tender steaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, upon the four consuming almost half their steaks, they pulled back from the meat to catch their respective breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping loudly, Akamaru sighed then plopped to his side, letting his tongue hang out of his muzzle as his belly sprawled on the table.  <i>Best.  Steak.  Ever...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew!  Good thing we undid our pants when we did!\" Kiba exclaimed with a hint of relief in his voice as he rubbed his extended gut firmly with both hands.  \"Heh, could'ja imagine if we tried to plow through this beast if we <i>hadn't?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassaging his own tummy, Hunter burped and grimaced, \"Ugh, I don't have to imagine...\" he noted, recalling that dreadful tummyache he suffered for doing exactly what Kiba had just warned against.  Nonetheless, a smile returned to his fuzzy little face as he leaned back and happily patted his bloated belly with both paws, giggling as he did.  \"Still, I can't believe how yummy these steaks are!  I always figured the \"good\" meat was always from those fancy shmancy restaurants where they charge too much and only give you an itty bitty cut of beef.  Well, boo to that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Naruto nodded in agreement and ruffled the pups' head playfully, as he grinned and nodded with agreement.  \"Took the words right outta my mouth,\" remarked Naruto as one hand massaged his distended belly.  He then glanced at Hunter and asked, \"Y'know, one other thing I was wondering about with that formula stuff, if you get younger, doesn't that mean your stomach gets smaller too?  How is it you can still eat as much as me'n dog-breath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Hunter glanced at the two and said, \"Cause as a kid, you got way more energy, and your metabolism is a whole lot faster than when you're all grown up and stuff!  It kinda makes up for being a lot smaller.\"  Hunter then grinned impishly and added, \"Plus you have a lot more fun stuffing your face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned to Kiba and, with a smirk, said, \"Hehe, and how competitive you think it'll make us?\"  Kiba grinned smugly and added, \"Nowhere near enough for you to ever beat me, bonehead.  So don't get your hopes up.\"  Raising an eyebrow, Naruto scoffed.  \"Oh, you can talk smack now, Kiba, but <i>juuuuust youuuuu wait...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing up at the two, Akamaru chimed in.  <i>How much more competitive could the two of you possibly get?  If you looked up the word competitive in the dictionary, there's probably a picture of you two glaring angrily at each other!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed at that mental image, but Kiba just grinned a bit more competitively and said, \"Y'know what?  Why wait?  How about after we finish up our steaks, we'll see who can polish off their soda first.\"  Naruto smirked and said, \"I'll do ya one better, after we finish, let's REFILL our pitchers, and whoever can drink the most after that wins.  Think you can handle that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined at the prospect.  <i>But won't we already be really...REALLY full when we're finished?  Getting back's gonna be a nightmare...unless the wolf kid's got a contact that can carry all of us out on a wheel barrel...</i>  He then turned to Hunter and, a bit hopefully, asked, <i>DO you have a contact that could carry us out in a wheel barrel?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hunter didn't hear him.  Instead, the young wolf pup grinned and raised his paw eagerly as he asked, \"Oooh!  Oooh!  I want in too!  Can I play too?\"  Despite their competitive banter, both boys couldn't help but chuckle at the young wolf-pup's childlike eagerness.  Laughing, Naruto nudged the wolf-pup in the arm and said, \"Heh, why not?  The more, the merrier, right?\"  Turning towards Kiba, he grinned mischievously and added, \"and by that, I mean the merrier it'll be when Kiba gets his ass kicked by BOTH of us.\"  Kiba grabbed his fork and knife, chuckling as smugly as he could.  \"Oh, dream on, ya dunce.  Now come on, we don't want these things getting cold, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, both Naruto and Hunter grabbed their silverware and went right back to town on their beef, alongside Kiba.  Akamaru rose to all four of his paws after some doing, and glanced down at his tummy.  <i>Ugh, I'm gonna look like a fuzzy ball once this is over...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, he licked his chops and dug his little face right back into the steak, chomping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Worth it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four press on, consuming more and more steak, stopping occasionally to catch their respective breaths, wash down meat with cola or water in Akamaru's case, and immediately, would dive right back into their tasty steaks.  All the while, their tummies continue to expand as more and more meat is gulped down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, as time presses on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time ticked by as the four hungry youths dug into their still-sizable steaks, the tender, juicy flavor of the meat driving them onwards as much as the promise of the upcoming competition. However, owing to the fact that they had each already consumed roughly 36 ounces of beef, they began slowing down, starting to feel just how much was packed into their bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba's shirts had now hiked up over their navels, the garments rising ever higher as their tummies expanded, and their zippers were nearl completely forced wide open, coming open even further as their swelling midsections intruded on them. In addition, their bellies were beginning to get ominously close to the table, but they were so engrosed in their steaks that the scarcely noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Hunter's tummy and clothes were in much the same state, his fuzzy midsection forcing his shirt up over his belly-button and opening his fly further and further. Like with the two humans, his tummy had also started growing slightly. Unlike the two boys, he noticed that his belly was starting to get uncomfortably close to the table, but the aroma of the steak beckoned him back, as did the promise of the upcoming competition. With that, he put it out of his head, tightened his grip on his fork and knife, and dove right back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, as he continued chomping on his steak, winced as he felt his stomach slowly expanding even more, forcing him to gradually move his back legs further and further apart. <i>Oh man,</i> he whined, gulping down his current mouthful and glancing at his tummy. Sure enough, it was now sagging even further beneath him, and he appeared as though he'd swallowed at least a few grapefruits whole. And, to his added dismay, the appendage was now alarmingly close to the table. <i>My tummy's getting so big...</i> Suddenly, the delectable aroma of the steak lured him back in, and he continued chomping away with reckless abandon. <i>Still too yummy to pass up...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they continued on in this manner for some time, chomping away at the still massive slabs of beef. Naruto, Kiba, and Hunter's shirts continued rising up, their flies now completely opened as their bellies, free from any restraint, grew closer and closer to the table. Akamaru's belly swelled bigger and bigger, forcing his back legs farther and farther apart and sagging ever closer to the table until, finally, the pup felt the growing appendage make contact with the surface. Akamaru whined, knowing he must look ridiculous, but his puppy-fied mind demanded he finish his steak. And so, with a queasy burp and another whine, Akamaru dove back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they had reduced the remaining 32 ounces of beef to 16 ounces. Then eight, four, two, one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, three sets of silverware clattered to three plates, followed by three rather loud, queasy belches. As one, Naruto, Kiba, and Hunter groaned and flopped back in their seats, arms hanging at their sides. In the anthro-pup's case, his tongue was hanging out the side of his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh man,\" Hunter groaned, bringing both paws up to sluggishly massage his furry belly. \"Akamaru was right; best steak ever...\" Naruto and Kiba, also massaging their tummies, were about to speak their assent, when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three's eyes flew wide open at the noise of the truly monstrous belch. Slowly, they turned their heads towards the source...and their mouths promptly dropped wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru was standing before his empty plate, wobbling in place a bit. <i>Ooohhhh...so...so much URP!....steak...</i> Said pup's belly had swollen massively, to the point where it looked as though he'd swallowed a fully-inflated basketball whole. His tummy, rather than simply sticking out from under him, now stuck out under all of his underside as a furry white sphere, even reaching out to the front and back of him. To their shock, it had grown so much that it appeared to be lifting his paws off the table a bit. His back legs, predictably, were stretched as far apart as they could possibly go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of himself, Kiba closed his mouth and smirked good-naturedly at the pup. \"Heh; enjoy your steak, Akamaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined, paws swiping through the air as he tried to get some purchase on the table. <i>You could...URP!...say that, yeah...</i> The pup stopped kicking his paws, deciding even trying to get himself in a good position was a lost cause, and instead flopped over the side onto his back, his massive white tummy sticking up into the air and his front paws hanging limp <i>Oh man, I feel like I'm gonna explode...</i>. Looking at Kiba, he made his eyes as big and watery as he could. <i>Tummy rub? Pretty please?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed, reaching an arm out. \"Ah, c'mon, Akamaru, you know you don't hafta use 'The Eyes' on me...\" Reaching toward Akamaru's stomach, he began vigorously rubbing the appendage, causing the pup to pant happily and kick his leg (at least, as much as his tummy would allow.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled, rubbing his own tummy. \"Heh; think we might all need tummy rubs right about now...\" At this, he, Naruto, and Kiba glanced down at their stomachs, even as the dog-nin continued rubbing his buddy's belly; indeed, their stomachs had all swollen to ridiculous proportioins, each looking as though they'd swallowed a large beach ball. Their shirts were now resting completely on top of their bellies, and the fronts of their respective shorts were feeling somewhat tight, in spite of the fact that their flies were completely opened and their buttons were undone. In addition, each of their bellies was now pressing noticeably against the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened as he massaged his tummy. \"Wow...our guts got his big just on one steak....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching as he rubbed his own stomach with his unoccupied hand, he turned to Naruto and smirked. \"Well, whaddaya expect when ya eat 72 ounces of meat in one sitting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru wagged his tail sluggishly. <i>Ya end up looking like you're carrying a dozen puppies, that's what...little to the left.</i> Chuckling, Kiba obliged, scratching the indicated spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping wetly, Hunter licked his chops. \"Maybe, but for the best steak ever, it's worth it.\" His eyes flicked down to his midsection, frowning when he saw it pressing against the table. \"Gettin' a little cramped here, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuzzled, Naruto looked down and noticed his own tummy pressing against the table. \"Eeesh, he's right.\" He turned to Kiba. \"You, uh, think we should adjust?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Nah, the booths are pretty big; we should be able to squeeze out.\" Akamaru, knowing how much bigger their stomachs were likely to get with the upcoming soda competition, whimpered; he had a sinking feeling he knew EXACTLY what would end up happening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter giggled. \"Squeeze out? Now? We still have soda to drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked and nudged Kiba in the shoulder. \"Kid has a point, dog-breath; you sure you're not trying to weasel your way outta losing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked back and playfully hit Naruto on the shoulder. \"In your dreams, Uzumaki; I'm planning on drinking you two under the table.\" Seeing a waiter passing by, he raised an arm up in the air. \"Oi! Can we get refills on our pitchers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter nodded, turning toward them. \"Why, certain...ly...\" he trailed off as he noticed the four's ridiculously distended tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn't help but laugh. \"Something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter pulled at his collar. \"Erm...n-no, but...are you sure? I mean, you four seem pretty full already...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we're still thirsty,\" Hunter piped up, looking directly at the man. \"Can't we have just one refill?\" His eyes widened, and he began whimpering a bit. \"Pretty please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err....\" The waiter faltered a bit, initially not sure how to deal with the sudden onslaught of wet eyes and hopeful whimpering. \"...certainly.\" He grabbed each of the still-partially full pitchers (and Akamaru's water bowl) and carried them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, chuckling, looked at Hunter. \"Nice use of the Puppy Eyes, Hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Hunter rubbed the back of his eyes. \"Heh heh, thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four continued chatting, laughing, and egging each other on until the waiter returned. With an uncertain \"Um...enjoy...?\", he set their drinks on the table and bustled off, eager to be anywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Hunter picked up his pitcher as Naruto and Kiba followed suit. \"Ready?\" The pup asked, wagging his tail. Giving an affirmative nod, Naruto and Kiba licked their lips, lifting the pitchers up to their faces. \"Awesome! Ready...set...go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the three were off, guzzling their soda like there was no tomorrow. Akamaru, even from his prone position, looked around at the three and rolled his eyes. <i>Well, this can only end well...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Akamaru grimaced as he watched the three youths chug relentless amounts of soda, filling up their already packed tight bellies.  As he watched, he could see their tummies swell up more and more as a mixture of liquid and carbonation filled their guts in a hurry.  From Akamaru's observation, it would have appeared as though the trio were chugging at around the same rate, with more than ample amount of their respective fizzy beverages left to go down.  <i>Least they said 'whoever can chug the most wins'...because there's no way any of them are gonna finish that much soda when their tummies are already that full...right...?</i>  Akamaru thought to himself, hopefully...kind of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the trio just kept powering through, with not a single one of them ready to be outdone by the other.  As it stands, Naruto and Kiba had already been bested by the little pup a few times already, and they weren't about to let him best them yet again, especially when each one was desperately trying not to be outdone by the other.  Hunter, on the other hand (or in his case, paw), didn't particularly care about winning, he was just having an absolute blast and kept on chugging as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the trio pulled the pitchers from their lips and caught their breaths, occasionally letting out a series of loud burps each to relief the pressure in their tummies.  Thumping his fist against his belly, Naruto let out a particularly strong belch, and grunted with relief.  \"Mmf, hope you guys can manage, cause we still gotta ways to go,\" he said, gesturing towards his and their still amply filled pitchers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scoffed and shook his head, \"Worry about yourself, bonehead, cause at this rate-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's eyes widened and his face went blank as he heard a slight rip.  To his alarm, both Naruto and Kiba seemed to have heard the same noise as they looked around for the source.  \"Huh?  Didja hear something?\" asked Hunter, ears perking.  Naruto nodded and examined his attire, \"Didn't come from me, how about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped and spotted Kiba's face now flushing a bit with embarrassment.  Immediately, a grin grew over Naruto's face as he nudged Hunter.  \"Heh, think we found the culprit,\" Naruto said, still grinning impishly as he leaned towards the embarrassed dog-nin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Please tell me that wasn't your pants...</i> Akamaru whined, in fear that his 'uniquely' patterned undergarments may now be exposed, and if so, he wouldn't hear the end of it, which would eventually lead to more and more bickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his and even Naruto's surprise, Kiba didn't grit his teeth or get angry like he usually did.  Instead, a smug grin grew over his face as folded his arms together and leaned back.  \"Yeah, ya caught me...that's the sound'uh the front of my pants giving in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto started snickering as immediately, he asked, \"Aaaand, err-hehe...you wouldn't happen to be wearing a certain pair of doggie pattern boxers...would'ja?\"  Even Hunter started giggling to himself, but still, Kiba didn't lose his cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but I don't care.  Know why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he didn't get a response, Kiba leaned back and patted his swollen gut proudly.  \"Because I didn't hear anyone else's pants start to rip, which means I'm packin' away more than the two of you!  And since we all ate the same steaks, I'd wager that puts me in the lead, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's smile dropped as the rusted wheels in his head started turning and piecing together what Kiba was insinuating.  And immediately, he scowled and snapped back, \"H-hey, no you didn't!  Your clothes are just-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before he could stutter a comeback, Kiba had already picked up his pitcher and proceeded to gulp vigorously.  \"What the hell?!  That's no fa-\" and again, before Naruto could complain, Hunter giggled and after some doing, got his pitcher up to his puppy muzzle and started guzzling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just sat there, flabbergasted for a moment as the dog-nin and wolf-pup chugged away.  Shaking his head, he grumbled under his breath and grabbed his pitcher.  \"Ah, whatever...\" he muttered, then proceeded to chug along with the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru just sat there for a moment, glancing up at Kiba almost impressed as his little tail wagged.  <i>Wow, I...think you just ninja'd the obnoxiousness out of the bonehead!</i> the puppy barked, earning a wink from Kiba and a muffled giggle from Hunter as they continued chugging.  Naruto, spotting the exchange, grumbled, knowing whatever the puppy just said was probably at his expense, but nonetheless, just kept on chugging with the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued as their bellies continued to swell up with the increasing amount of soda filling them up.  More and more, Kiba felt the front of his pants tear just slightly more, but shook it off and just kept drinking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as time went on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Akamaru stared in amazement as the three's already-engorged bellies continued swelling as more and more of the fizzy, carbonated liquid entered them. <i>Wow...it's almost like watching someone fill water balloons,</i> the pup thought to himself, burping as he did so. Sighing, he licked his chops. <i>Then again, considering how much they already have packed in there, it's not too surprising...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched, their bellies continuously expanded, pressing more and more into the table. They evidently noticed this, as they winced slightly, but they continued guzzling, none of them willing to let up. As such, even as their tummies pressed harder into the table, the appendages started bulging out to the sides as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's eyes widened. <i>Ohhh, that doesn't bode well...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to Akamaru's distress, the three continued chugging away, the cool liquid further inflating their already comically-large tummies and causing the appendages to continue bulging out to the sides. Kiba, in particular, grinned as he heard (and felt) the front of his pants slowly but continuously ripping. <i>Heh; don't care how embarrassing this is, if it means I'm beating those two!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Kiba was continuing to rip his shorts, Hunter and Naruto chugged as fast as they could, desperate to catch up. They felt the front of their opened shorts continuing to grow tighter and tighter as their bellies continued intruding on them, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rrrrrrrrriiiip.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Hunter both beamed as they felt the front of their shorts rip a bit, freeing up a bit of extra room. Giving determined grins to each other, they renewed their chugging with even greater vigor than before. Kiba, having heard the ripping noises as well, scowled and redoubled his efforts, not planning to let either of them get ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru sighed as, over the next several minutes, the air was filled with soft ripping noises as the boys and wolf pup continued chugging away, swelling their bellies even further and causing more damage to their shorts. Their zippers, already stretched past their limits, forced their way further and further down their struggilng shorts, ripping the fabric apart and, though none of them could see it at the moment, slowly exposing more of their undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru groaned. <i>Of all the days to wear the boxers with the silly dog faces on them...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Hunter weren't much further behind, though, as their own shorts continued ripping further and further as their bellies inflated further and bulged out further to the sides as they chugged away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, just as Akamaru thought they'd rip the whole front of their damn shorts open, they all slammed their still considerably filled pitchers down, leaned back in their seats, rested their hands (or paws) on their bellies, and all let out rather loud, queasy-sounding belches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...much...soda...\" Hunter groaned, belching again and rubbing his tummy with both paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winced, resting one hand on his belly while he let the other one dangle at his side. \"You're...you're not kidding. Feels...feels like my stomach's gonna explode...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked, albeit in a pained manner. \"Heh; you...you guys giving uUUURRRRRRP!\" His taunt was cut off by a massive, belch. Hunter giggled uproariously while the dog-nin blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, on the other hand, smirked in return. \"N-no...not giving up...just gotta rest...\" The boy exhaled, moving his hands up and down his stupendously swollen tummy. \"Phew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reclined in their seats, they looked down and examined their midsections. The copious amounts of cola they had consumed had made their bellies grow even further, pushing even harder into the table and bulging greatly out to the sides. Their liquid-packed midsections sloshed and shimmied with the slightest of movements (much to Hunter's delight, who took to shaking his belly with both paws and giggling at its movement), and a breeze playing underneath the table informed them that, by now, their shorts had probably ripped enough to expose most of their undergarments, and a bit of their bare legs too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru looked to toward Kiba's stomach (or as best he could, given his belly-up position) and gaped at just how big it had gotten. <i>Kiba,</i> Akamaru whined, ears drooping, <i>exactly how much more soda were you guys planning on drinking...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked and scratched his pal's bulbous tummy (much to the pup's delight). \"As much as we can fill our guts with, buddy.\" With that, he sank into his seat, sluggishly rubbing his midsection and occassionally burping to release pressure. Naruto and Hunter followed suit, massaging their tummies, belching, and in Hunter's case, occasionally shaking his belly and giggling as it sloshed and jiggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of resting up....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After some resting up, Naruto sighed with relief and said, \"Well, I dunno about you two, but I think I'm gettin' my second wind here!\"  Both Kiba and Hunter nodded and, in unison, all three leaned forward and reached for their pitchers.  Once more; in unison, all the three yelped sharply in pain.  Akamaru's ears perched up as he tried to lift his head enough to see what the commotion was about.  Sure enough, just as he feared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're all wedged against the tables, aren't you...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter whined a bit as he massaged his bloated tummy tenderly to coax the pain he'd just inflicted upon it.  Kiba and Naruto both just groaned in pain and annoyance.  \"Ah, crap...now we've done it,\" Kiba complained, seeing his bloated belly wedged firmly against the table, just like the others.  Naruto tried to forcibly pull himself from the table, but the sensation of his stomach scraping against the edges of the table was immensely painful and forced him to stop immediately.  \"Ow!\" yelped Naruto, wincing in pain as he did.  Scowling, Naruto turned to Kiba and barked, \"Why didn't you guys just get a regular table?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog-nin raised an eyebrow at the accusation and replied, \"Hey, don't blame us, dumbass!  They sat us!  How were WE supposed to know our guts would get <i>this</i> big?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, on the other hand, just whined, still trying to pull his bloated furry tummy free from the table.  \"C'mon, guys, please don't fight.  That's not gonna help us get out!\" the young wolf-pup whined as he continued to struggle against the table.  Glancing back at him and each other, both boys sighed and nodded reluctantly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, kid' right.  We gotta find a way out, not bicker at each other like a pair of jackasses,\" muttered Kiba, earning a nod from Naruto as he scratched the back of his head.  \"Nah, that was my fault.  Sorry for losing my lid like that,\" Naruto said, earning a surprised glance from Kiba and Akamaru, (who was still too full to lift his head properly in order to make eye contact).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Kiba just said, \"Ah, don't worry about it.  Right now, we just gotta find a way outta here.\"  Ears perking, Hunter turned to his two (current) elders and asked, \"Oh!  Can't we just ask the staff for help?\"  Immediately, both Naruto and Kiba grimaced and shook their heads.  \"Nooooo thanks...\" muttered Kiba, shuttering at the embarrassment that would ensue if they actually asked someone to undo the table because they let their stomachs grow so large that they were actually trapped in their booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's face lit up as he added, \"Well, why don't we try and pull the table off the hinges ourselves?  These things aren't <i>that</i> strong, right?\"  To which both Hunter and Kiba shared a glance, before Kiba sighed and turned his attention back to Naruto, rubbing his forehead, nodding unenthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, bonehead, that's a...semi viable option.  So I guess we could do that.  But lemme ask you something; you liked the steak here, yeah?\" asked Kiba, to which Naruto scoffed and said, \"Pfft, you kiddin'?  Best damn steak I've eaten in years!\" he exclaimed, patting his belly proudly, and wincing at the subsequent pain that resulted, earning another quick and sharp nod from the dog-nin.  \"Good, I did too.  So did Hunter, and Akamaru ESPECIALLY.  Now, wouldn't you want to KEEP enjoying these delicious steaks?  Because I certainly would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching his head, Naruto just raised his shoulders and asked, \"What's your point?\"  To which Kiba slapped his forehead with his palm and said, \"Oh for the love of-you think these guys'll ever let us back in if we break their damn tables?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Naruto was able to put two and two together.  \"Ohhhhhhhh, okay!\" Naruto said, FINALLY getting it.  \"Sheesh, why not just say that?\"  Kiba sighed, shaking his head, unwilling to respond to another boneheaded remark from the ultimate bonehead himself.  The pain in their stomachs wasn't going away however.  \"Ugh, guys, we gotta get outta this soon, or I'm gonna be sick...\" Kiba groaned, earning unenthusiastic nods of agreement from the others, to imply they were on the same boat.  Stifling a particularly queasy burp, Hunter grimaced and said, \"Well, what do we do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Akamaru's face lit up as he slowly hoisted himself in the direction of the three youths, still unable to lift his little paws up to support his massive belly.  <i>Guys!  I've got it!</i> barked the tiny pup, earning curious glances from Kiba, the pup and Naruto, who then turned to the others and asked, \"Huh?  W-what's he saying, guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kiba replied, \"Akamaru says he has a plan!\"  He then turned his attention to his little bloated canine pal and asked, \"So?  Let's hear it, boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru shuddered, realizing his plan wasn't going to be pleasant for those involved, and likely not anyone else around them, but nonetheless chimed in as he turned to Kiba and proceeded to bark.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, well, first of all, this might be a bit...unusual, but if we're lucky, it just might do the trick.  All you three need to do is...</i></span></div></div>",

I mean, we got wedged in after we drank all that soda, right?\" Naruto and Kiba, blushing slightly, nodded in response. \"Yeah, I'm sure it'll work!

We burp as long and loud as we can until we can slip out!\" He giggled, rubbing the back of his head. \"I mean, if we're gonna embarrass ourselves worse than we already have, why not have some fun doing it?\" As if to accentuate this, he licked his chops, took a deep breath....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BRAAAAAAAAAAP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and let loose with a rather considerable belch. He giggled, even as several of the patrons and wait staff looked toward him in a mixture of shock and disgust. \"See?\" he piped up, completely ignoring the looks. \"We can still make this fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba glanced at each other. \"Well...\" the blonde began, slowly beginning to grin. \"If the kid insists...\" Leaning back, he brought his hands up to his overstuffed tummy and began kneading it with his thumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned in return. \"...then I guess we don't have a choice.\" He began kneading his own belly, taking deep breaths as he did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter giggled. \"That's the spirit, guys!\" Taking their cue, he began kneading his own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru watched, a bit anxious, as the three continued kneading their bellies. This continued for a minute or so, before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BRAAAAAAAAAAAAP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BUUUURRRRRARRRRRRRRRRRP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....the three let loose with massive belches that shook the table and drew even more disgusted looks from the rest of the restaurant. \"Phew!\" Naruto exclaimed, heartily patting his tummy. \"That was a good one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, already kneading his belly again, grinned. \"You're tellin' me; that felt great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter beamed, eagerly sloshing his tummy about. \"Yeah, but we're still stuck! Keep burpin', fellas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru began rolling (<i>rolling!</i>) over on his side, but he managed to right himself, his paws batting uselessly at the air. <i>Well, at least they're enthusiastic...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin short order, the three once again let loose with more titanic belches. Laughing and catching their breath, they wasted little time before getting to work kneading their bellies again....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BURRARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...aaaaaaaand again......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRAAP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for several minutes, the three overstuffed, stuck occupants of the table continuously belching, kneading their bellies, belching again, and then repeating the whole process all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru wagged his tail in spite of himself. <i>Heh, pretty good pipes on all of them...</i> His gaze fell on Hunter as the young pup let loose with a massive belch, his mouth opening wide. <i>Especially him; wonder what he can do at his regular age...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like forever, Naruto shifted in his seat, and grinned when he felt his belly moving. \"Hey, guys! I think we've burped enough!\" Grabbing the sides of his ruined shorts, he tugged, grunted, and finally stood up. Wincing, he shimmied out the side of his booth, still holding up his ruined pants. Finally, with an audible PLOP, Naruto freed himself from the booth. Stumbling a bit, he nonetheless managed to right himself and stand upright. Smirking, he turned to his companions. \"Well? You guys coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked in return. \"Yeah, just gimme a sec...\" Reaching out, he grabbed Akamaru with both hands and deposited the overstuffed puppy into the neck of his shirt. Smiling, he looked down. \"Ya OK down there, Akamaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup barked his assent. <i>Well, there's a lot to rest on, I'll give ya that much...</i> Kiba, laughing, grabbed the sides of his shorts, stood up, and shimmied out the same way Naruto had. He sighed in relief as he stood beside Naruto...before the blonde looked down and snickered. \"Heh...nice undies, Inuzuka...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba flushed a deep red as he realized that ripped state of his shorts ensured that he, and by extension the entire restaurant, could see his green boxers patterned with cartoony dog faces. \"Sh-shut up!\" he snarled. He looked down at Naruto's undies. \"Like those stupid heart-patterned undies are any better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smirk fell from Naruto's face, and his skin reddened as well. \"C-cram it, dog-breath!\" Akamaru whined, fearing they'd stand there for minutes and bicker about each others' underwear. <i>Wow, that came out sounding weird...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Hunter managed to free himself at that moment, awkwardly hopping down from his seat (after having left his payment on the table) and somehow maintaining his balance as he gripped his shorts, which also revealed his crescent-moon patterned undies in all their glory. \"Phew; thought we were gonna be stuck there for hours!\" Lurching up beside the boys, he looked up at them, beaming. \"I dunno about you guys, but I'm about ready to head back to the inn.\" He giggled, his tail wagging. \"That bathtub's callin' my name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba looked down at him, confused by the seeming non-sequitur. \"...wha?\" Naruto finally said, blinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter giggled even harder at his expression. \"Of course! I'm not sleepy, but I still wanna relax somehow! Plus,\" he added in a mock-conspiratorial tone, \"It'll give me an opportunity to grow back to my proper age without skeeving you guys out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru poked his head out of Kiba's shirt, tilting his head curiously. <i>You mean...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Hunter replied cheerfully. \"It's been tons of fun being like this, but I kinda wanna go back to normal for now.\" He grinned. \"Of course, don't let that stop you from usin' that formula...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned. \"You kidding? No way we're passing that chance up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded in agreement. \"Yeah! Not to mention,\" he added, smirking, \"With you at your regular age, maybe we can get a little revenge for you manipulating us with your cuteness...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked happily. <i>I can help with that; think I'm gonna take another hit of that stuff too.</i> Eyes widening in delight, Kiba reached inside his shirt and gave the dog's tummy another scratch, causing his tongue to loll out in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter only giggled. \"Heh heh, I'd like to see you try!\" Keeping a firm hold on his ruined pants, he began lurching off toward the exit. Kiba and Naruto, not to be outdone, followed close behind him, moving as fast as they dared. As they went, the whole restaurant watched them go with wide eyes. Wasn't every day you got customers like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three lurched along the streets of the small town, drawing odd looks from passerby. They ignored them as best they could, trying to support their bellies and shorts to the best of their ability, and occasionally belching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like ages, the three reached the inn. Smiling in relief, they made their way inside, stumbled to their room, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

FINALLY!\" griped Naruto, in an exhausted manner before plopping backwards onto his bed, causing his ridiculously swollen belly to stick upward.  Kiba shook his head and hoisted himself down on the end of his own bed, leaning back as Akamaru still rested atop his especially large stomach.  Seeing the puppies head pop out from his shirt, he grinned and, despite his exhausted state, ruffled the little critters head, causing him to turn and lick the boy across the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter entered the room, still clutching both his extended tummy and shorts for support, Kiba turned to the other two and with a sigh and smirk, said, \"Well, that was certainly...an interesting outing, huh?\"  Naruto, still dazed and fully reclined on his bed, just burped wetly and patted his belly happily.  \"Sure was...\" he remarked, recalling the taste of that delicious steak, the ample amount of soda the trio chugged, and post-soda embarrassment that occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat on a nearby chair, no longer needing to support his shorts, Hunter's hind paws kicked idly, still massaging his own tummy as he pepped in, \"But at least you guys had fun, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Kiba and Naruto; after sitting up from his formerly lazed position, shared a glance and smiled, before turning back to the wolf-pup and nodding in unison.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, sure was!\" replied Naruto as Kiba grinned and added, \"and lot of that was thanks to you, kiddo!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just giggled and rubbed the back of his little fuzzy head.  \"Heh, you guys are too nice!\"  he replied, but Naruto and Kiba hefted themselves off the bed and headed near the youthful wolf-pup.  \"Seriously.  You got this kinda energy about you that just makes things fun!\"  Naruto exclaimed, earning a nod of agreement from Kiba, who added, \"Yeah, like the sticky buns, racing around the village, hell, even having a burping contest so we'd at least have a little fun when we tried deflating our guts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which Naruto grinned boastfully and added, \"Which I totally won, mind you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Akamaru shook his head and barked, <i>Ha!  Those were squeaks compared to the ones exploding out of Hunter!\"</i>  To which, the wolf-pup just snickered some more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pfft, you think that's impressive?  You outta hear Natsu...that pink haired lout gives a whole new meaning to the phrase 'Dragon-Breath'....yeesh...</i> He thought to himself, but nonetheless, began blushing beneath his fur as he rubbed his head bashfully before smiling up at the two elder boys and saying, \"Aww, thanks, you guys!  I appreciate that big time, but really, I'm just glad you're all having fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just ruffled the wolf-pup's head playfully and said, \"An absolute blast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned slyly at the display then turned to Kiba and said, \"D'awww, you big sap, you gonna miss him being in his cute lil puppy form?\"  Hearing that, Kiba immediately sputtered and turned to Naruto sharply, \"W-what?!  No!  I mean, y-yeah, b-but...onlycausehessocutelikethis!\"  Upon accidentally spouting that last statement, Kiba's face flushed with embarrassment and annoyance as Naruto snickered in amusement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just giggled and nudged the dog-nin playfully.  \"Heehee!  That's okay, Kiba!  I'm just taking a break for now so I don't get TOO used to being a pup.  Besides, now, it'll YOUR guys turn to be adorable!\"  His grin then turned impish as he added, \"Y'know...if you can out-cute THIS...\" with those last words, Hunter smiled a wide, puppy smile at the dog-nin who turned away, absolutely flustered and overwhelmed trying not to succumb to the last ditch cuteness overload...and failing miserably.  The result of which left Naruto laughing hysterically as even Akamaru couldn't help but snicker to himself.  <i>It's gonna take a lot to be cuter than that...for you two, not me,</i> Akamaru barked confident in his own natural puppy cuteness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, for the sake of Kiba's embarrassment, Hunter stopped as his face lit up.  \"Ooh!  That reminds me, I gotta give you guys your vials!\"  He said, reaching for his bag to grab his attire and some vials, but Naruto just shook his head and said, \"Don't worry about it.  We'll wait til you change back first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, we should probably wait til we've digested enough of our meals to actually do something,\" Kiba added, before turning back to Akamaru and with a grin, said, \"cause unless we decide to roll Akamaru around like a ball, I don't think he's gonna be going anywhere anytime soon.\"  The pup blushed beneath his white fur, but Kiba just smiled playfully and sat back down next to him, scratching his tummy, causing the pup to forget about the short term embarrassment of his current girth, and just smile blissfully as his dangling hind paws kicked happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged, putting the vials back down and instead grabbing his adult clothes and pressing them against his tummy as he still tried to maintain a hold of both his swollen gut and his busted shorts.  \"No problem.  See you guys in a bit!\" he pepped before hopping into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they heard the water run and what sounded like a progressively older wolf voice whistling to himself in the shower, both boys continued chatting amongst themselves as they relaxed atop their respective beds.  The two chatted about past missions, training, some of their other competitive ventures, and their escapades over the past few days, to which, Kiba thought back to the steak house and, with a competitive grin, added, \"Y'know, we still got unfinished business we'll have to settle sooner or later, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised an eyebrow quizzically.  \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That soda chugging contest, ya dolt!  We never got to see who could outdrink who cause'uh what happened with that damn table!\" Kiba responded.  But Naruto just grinned smugly and replied, \"Yeah, sure, act like you're TOTALLY not grateful that us getting wedged spared you the embarrassment of getting your ass kicked by me...again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, excuse me, but last I checked, my pants were busting before either of you guys!\" Kiba responded, but Naruto waved his hand dismissively and said, \"Yeah, having weaker made pants means you were drinking more, eh?  I don't think so.  We all had the same amount of soda in our pitchers!  You just wanted to psyche me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stared for a moment, then chuckled to himself, before saying, \"It worked, didn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which, Naruto just sat there, dumbfounded for a moment, then...he too, started snickering to himself as he shook his head and added, \"Hehe, guess so.  Still, me'n Hunter had one a few nights back and I drank him way under the table.  Who knows, maybe we can give it another try later on...y'know...if we're not sitting in a booth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys grimaced at the not so faint memory of all three of them getting wedged between the booth and their seats.  Akamaru just snickered to himself and barked, <i>But thanks to the quick thinking of one part-time puppy, you all got out!  I think that calls for a tummy rub.  Wouldn't you agree, Kiba?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just laughed and shook his head.  \"You win, boy,\" Kiba said before rubbing his pup's tummy playfully, again, earning a dopey grin from Akamaru's little white furred face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys continued to chat for a while, until finally, the faucet shut, and after some drying off, out came Hunter, once again in his adult form, wearing a pair of khaki shorts and a black tanktop.  \"Ahhh, gotta admit, being a kid felt great, but it's refreshing being my old self again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru snickered and barked, <i>Emphasis on OLD.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which, Hunter laughed and rubbed the back of his head, \"Eh, not quite yet.\"  He then turned to the others and asked, \"So, you guys wanna wait til you digest your food first, or do you wanna take a hit so you can get a little more use what being a kid is gonna feel like?  Either way's cool, I got plenty of these things to go around!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys thought for a moment, then turned their attention back to Hunter and decided to...</span></div></div>",

I wanna stay a pup for a little longer.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled. \"Sure!\" Making his way over to his duffel, he retrieved a vial of the formula, walked back over to Akamaru, and popped the cork off. \"Open wide, little fella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYipping happily, Akamaru obliged, opening his muzzle as far as it would go. Chuckling again, Hunter upended the vial, letting it fall into Akamaru's mouth. The pup happily lapped up the liquid, not stopping until the last drop had entered his mouth. Smacking his lips, the pup wagged his tail. <i>Ahhh....that's the stuff.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba gave his pal's tummy a final ruffle and looked back toward Naruto. \"So...whaddaya wanna do now? I mean, we got some time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shrugged. \"I dunno, really; I'm not really tired, but it's not like we can do much with these.\" He gestured to his overfilled belly, smacking it and belching loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled. \"Worry not, gentlemen.\" Getting back up, he retrieved his duffel and brought it back over to the boys. \"That nifty little formula ain't the only thing I got in there...\" Unzipping it, he set it in the middle of himself and the teens. \"I like to carry little knick-knacks and gadgets to keep myself entertained when I'm traveling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba raised an eyebrow. \"You...really don't mind us going through your stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shook his head. \"Nope.\" He winced a bit. \"One thing, though; if any of the knick-knacks in here start whispering in your ear, drop 'em like a sack of potatoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean knick-knacks like this?\" Naruto piped up, holding up an object that he'd fished out while Hunter and Kiba had been talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter turned toward Naruto. \"Items like wha-<i>holy hell, how did that end up in my bag?!</i>\" He paled noticeably under his fur as he laid eyes on the item in Naruto's possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe item appeared to be a mask, though not like any mask Naruto, Kiba, or Akamaru had ever seen before. It was vaguely heart-shaped, and covered in a variety of almost psychedelic colors and patters. It had two long, spike-like protrusions sticking up from its \"eyebrows\", with several more spikes just like it sticking out along the sides of its \"face\". The most striking-and eerie-aspect of it, however, were the eyes. Taking up a good part of the mask,  they were large, red things, with black irises containing black pupils that were only visible because of the eerie green coloring around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto noticed Hunter's expression and frowned. \"Eh? What's the matter, Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru only looked at the mask for a few seconds before looking up at Kiba and whining, <i>Kiba, I'm getting some SERIOUSLY bad vibes from that thing, whatever it is...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, Kiba scratched Akamaru's ears in a way he hoped was reassuring. \"Me too, Akamaru...\" He turned toward Naruto. \"Oi, Uzumaki! Drop that damn thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto began to turn to Kiba and protest, but when his eyes fell upon the mask, he felt a cold sensation slither down the back of his neck. \"...yyyyeah, I'm thinking that might be a good idea,\" Naruto conceded, gently setting it upon the ground. No sooner had he done so than Hunter reached into his bag, grabbed some sort of odd container, opened it, and stuffed the mask inside. Slamming the container shut, he sighed. \"Phew, that was way too close for comfort...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three from Konoha looked at him strangely. \"...Hunter, what the hell was that thing?\" Naruto spoke up, shuddering a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sighed, shaking his head. \"In my travels, I've kinda picked up the habit of grabbing whatever caught my interest...\" he winced, but forced himself to continue. \"...which, unfortunately, includes a great number of dark talismans and sentient relics of pure evil bent on destruction.\" He motioned toward the container. \"That little piece of horror was the latter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kiba, and Akamaru exchanged an uneasy look. \"So, uh...\" Kiba began, trying to keep his composure, \"any...anything else in there we should know about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter closed his eyes, thinking. After a few moments, he opened them again and replied \"Nah, I don't think so; the rest of the stuff in here's pretty innocuous...\" at this, he managed a slight smile. \"...though probably nothing you guys have seen before.\" He began rummaging through his bag, looking for anything of interest. Naruto and Kiba, looking at each other somewhat nervously, quickly joined him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours passed as the two ninja and anthro-wolf examined the contents of Hunter's bag. Among them, they discovered a small, rectangular device with some sort of bifurcated cord attached to it (\"An MP3 player,\" Hunter had explained, placing the two split ends of the cord inside his ears. \"Plays all kinds of music!\"), a bulkier, rectangular device with an assortment of buttons on it, and a screen that responded to certain button presses (\"'Video game'\"? Kiba had asked, fiddling with the buttons. \"Nothing you can do in these most ninja can't do in real life...\"), and another odd, rectangular device, this one with a screen that took up most of its surface (\"An electronic reader; it can store a whole bunch of books at a time,\" Hunter had beamed as he showed them the books he had uploaded; there were at least a dozen or so. \"Eh heh, I'm kinda a bookworm...\"). Finally, as they placed the last of the objects back in the bag, Naruto and Kiba had looked down and noticed, to their relief, that their tummies had shrunken a great deal, existing now only as round shapes beneath their shirts (even if their pants were still busted.) Even Akamaru's tummy had shrunken enough for him to once again stand on his paws, though he still looked as though he'd had a good meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned, rubbing his belly through his shirt. \"Heh, wouldja look at that...\" he looked toward Naruto, grinning. \"I dunno about you, but I'm about ready to try that stuff out for myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled, albeit sadly. \"Y-yeah, I guess I am too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not lost on either Kiba or Hunter, the latter of whom asked \"You still sure you wanna do this? I mean, I know it wasn't exactly a picnic the first time around...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked toward Hunter, and some of the sadness left his eyes. \"Y-yeah, I'm sure.\" He sighed. \"I mean, I didn't really have any friends the first time through...\" He reached an arm out beside him and gave Kiba a friendly pat on the back. \"...but I do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scoffed, though his smirk belied his true reaction to the gesture. \"Ah, don't go gettin' all soft on me,\" he jabbed good-naturedly, throwing a friendly arm about Naruto's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling once again at the friendship the two shared, Hunter reached into his duffel, pulled out two vials of the formula, and handed them to each boy. \"Alright, guys,\" he began once the two had uncorked their vials. \"Midna will have already stopped by with your clothes, but she'll probably have thrown them every which way in the closet to get back at me for that little jab about her being drunk earlier.\" He scratched the back of his head nervously. \"Do you, uh, wanna wait until I've got the clothes out, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Nah; way I figure, we'll drink thiis stuff, then just relax in these clothes for a couple minutes till ya find them.\" Naruto, blushing a bit, nonetheless nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled. \"Great!\" He made his way over to the closet, even while keeping an eye on the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEying their vials, the boys glanced at each other. \"Well...\" Kiba began ,raising the vial to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...bottoms up,\" Naruto finished, doing the same. As one, they knocked them back in one go, smacking their lips at the peculiar flavor. \"Ya feel anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shook his head. \"Nah, not ye---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, both boys began feeling rather odd. Akamaru, seeing the confusion on their faces, wagged his  tail. <i>Heh heh, any second now...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"W-whoa...\" muttered Naruto, feeling an overwhelming tingling sensation overtake his entire body.  He turned to Kiba, who seemed to be having the same reaction, then, suddenly, things seem to be getting progressively bigger.  Or, more accurately, THEY seemed to be getting progressively smaller, and as their facial features began to adjust and alter, yes; younger as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy cow, l-look at their faces!</i>  Akamaru barked excitedly, tail still wagging as he watched the two youths progressively shrink and shrink inside their own attires.  Turning his attention over to the boys, Hunter just laughed heartily, nodding as he said with a snicker, \"Yep!  Now wait til the whole thing is done!  Cuteness overload, guaranteed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a long, overwhelmingly 'funny' sensation, Naruto's eyes slowly fluttered open.  \"Huh, i-it worked!\" he said, with a notably higher pitched, and more youthful sounding voice, which caught him off guard, as his tiny hands clamped over his mouth.  Examining himself further, seeing himself just sitting in his oversized baggy adult clothes, he started giggling just slightly to himself.  \"I...I'm a kid again...!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow-wee!  This is...really cool!\" said another youthful voice.  Naruto turned and spotted a much younger Kiba sitting in his oversized attire as well, just gazing at himself wide-eyed with a big toothy smile on his face.  Naruto smiled and said, \"Holy crap, look'it you, Kiba!  You look so...so small!\"  Kiba glanced back at Naruto and started giggling childishly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who's talkin'!\" chimed Kiba, still giggling to himself, before turning up and looking up at his puppy companion.  \"So?  Whadduya think, boy?\" asked Kiba eagerly.  To his surprise, Akamaru barked a youthful bark, and leaped from the bed and into the boy's chest, causing to laugh heartily as the puppy licked his face affectionately again and again, yipping happily as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stopped browsing through the closet for a moment and turned to get a closer look at the boys.  Between watching a youthful Kiba laugh and play with his puppy pal, and watching Naruto still just stare wide-eyed in his oversized attire, giggling happily to himself, the sight was surprisingly overwhelming for Hunter, who cleared his throat and turned away a bit, to keep his heart from melting then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehe, so?  How's it feel, boys?\" chimed Hunter curiously, unable to advert his gaze from the three youths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just beamed happily and said, \"Awesome!  Just, awesome!  I got all this energy in me that I ain't had in years!  Like, like I just wanna run in the park and chase things with my little buddy over here!\"  Akamaru yipped especially happy at that chasing things in the park notion.  The two went on missions and adventures all the time, but it'd been literally ages since either one had just gone to play in the park like when they were kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just nodded and smiled as he said, \"Yup!  Like I said, your body and mind not only regress to a more youthful state, but so does your energy and metabolism.  So you're all gonna be a lot more energetic and excitable than you'd usually be...and that's saying something considering how energetic and excitable you both were already.\"  Kiba just giggled and rubbed the back of his head bashfully.  \"Heehee, fair point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Hunter and Kiba then turned to Naruto, as Hunter; slightly more cautiously, once again asked, \"How about you, Naruto?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence had passed.  Naruto stared down at his tiny form in silence for a moment longer.  In all truth, Naruto had come into this, expecting a resurgence of painful memories to hit him all at once like a ten ton sack of bricks.  That suddenly, he'd be a kid again, and all the pain and heartache and misery that he suffered as a child would come waltzing right back into his life as soon as that vial was gulped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in this moment of becoming a child once more, he realized something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...No one was afraid of him.  No one was mad at him.  Not a single person was telling him to crawl back to that empty, lonely apartment and wait there all alone for the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was allowed to be a kid again, and in this moment, he wasn't alone or hated.  For the briefest of moments, he almost went misty eyed at this overwhelming feeling of relief and awe.  Instead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Instead, he just smiled a wide, happy smile, and; to the surprise and relief of the others, started giggling.  \"I feel...great!\" Naruto finally replied, causing the anthro-wolf to inwardly sigh with relief, as he too, partially expected the worst.  \"Heck, I feel greater than great!  I feel fantastic!!\"  Laughing happily, he stood up, earning a snicker from Hunter as the boy's entire body; save for his head and little arms were completely covered by his now tarp-like T-Shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I just wanna...play!\" Naruto blurted, giggling to himself.  Kiba chuckled, placing the pup atop his head like the old days and stood up, also completely covered by his giant shirt as he playfully nudged Naruto as he said, \"Heh, ya took the words right outta my mouth, bonehead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just laughed as he continue searching high and low in the closet and said, \"Well, don't worry, we won't be cooped up for much longer, just gotta find-\"  Then, his ears perked up, \"Aha!\" he exclaimed happily as he reached beneath a sea of crumpled clothes, and pulled out the respective attires for both Naruto and Kiba, both of which were still in surprisingly pristine condition.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hehe, thank you, Midna...</i> Hunter thought to himself as he turned to the boys and handed them their more appropriately proportioned attires.  \"Here ya go, boys!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two youths beamed happily, admiring the change of clothing in their little hands, before Naruto headed over to the bathroom to change, leaving Kiba to keep playing with Akamaru for a moment before Naruto returned, fully dressed.  Kiba gave the boy a thumbs up then headed to the bathroom as well, before returning with his new attire and necklace.  Despite himself, Naruto grinned and said, \"Lookin' snazzy, Kiba!\"  Kiba just laughed and said, \"Heh, thanks, Uzumaki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter then turned towards the three and asked, \"Well, boys?  Whadduya feel like doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two youths turned to each other for a moment, then grinned mischievously, before turning back to the elder wolf-person and answering...</span></div></div>",

Me 'n Akamaru'll lead the way!\" As though to punctuate this, the pup leapt out of his hood and landed on the floor beside him, yipping eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto pouted. \"You're leading?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba jabbed Naruto playfully in the arm. \"Well, duh; me 'n Akamaru know the way, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah,\" Naruto admitted, folding his arms. \"Still, I kinda hoped we could...um...\" Naruto gulped, suddenly looking a little unsure. \"Ya know...race?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed, giving Naruto another friendly jab in the shoulder. \"What're ya gettin' all nervous for, ya big goof? Ya wanna do something, ya say it!\" Beaming, he took the arm he'd used to jab Naruto and draped it about his shoulders, pulling him in closer. \"We're friends, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Naruto appeared to get a bit misty-eyed, and both Kiba and Hunter got slightly alarmed...at least, until Naruto's face split in a huge grin. \"Aww, don't go gettin all sappy on me!\" he retorted, playfully shoving Kiba away. The little dog-nin, rather than get upset, simply giggled and shoved Naruto back with his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled warmly at the sight. <i>Man, for all their arguing, they really are friends, aren't they...</i> Still smiling, he went over to his duffel and grabbed his MP3; he'd need something to do at the park, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did this, Akamaru looked up at Kiba and wagged his tail. <i>Hey, Kiba, I think I know how you 'n Naruto can have that race and we can still get to the park.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling down, Kiba grinned at his pal. \"Really? What didja have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, hearing this, turned toward the dog-nin and his partner. \"Huh? What's Akamaru sayin' now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, still kneeling, turned his head toward Naruto. \"Akamaru says he knows how we can get to the park and still have that race.\" Naruto's face damn near lit up and this revelation, but before he could respond, Kiba turned back to Akamaru. \"So what's your plan, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru wagged his tail. <i>OK, so what I was thinkin' was this: I'll lead the way, and you 'n Naruto can follow behind me and race each other to your heart's content. Sound like a plan?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned, ruffling his buddy's head. \"Sounds great to me, boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was scarcely able to keep from grinning as Kiba got to his feet and turned to face him. \"So? What'd he say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smiled. \"He said he'd lead the way, and the two of us could just race one another.\" The smile became a smirk. \"You OK losing to a puppy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked in return. \"Heehee, so long as it means I beat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba folded his arms, still smirking. \"Heh, in your dreams...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing at the display, Hunter walked toward the door. \"Well, whoever's gonna win, you boys look like you're about ready to go.\" At Naruto and Kiba's eager agreement, Hunter opened the door. \"Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner was that word out of Hunter's muzzle than Akamaru, in a flash of white fur, bolted right out the door, followed closely by the two young boys. Hunter, initially a bit flustered, managed a smile. \"I'll take that as a resounding 'yes'.\" Grabbing his earbuds, he placed them in his ears and strolled out the door after them. <i>Eh, so long as I can follow their scent, I can find the park and maybe catch up with them....</i> He smiled and shook his head as he heard Akamaru's yips and Naruto and Kiba's shouts and giggles in the distance, and saw their shrinking forms as they ran. <i>And then of course, there's that...</i> Chuckling, he reached into his pocket, hit the 'Play' button on his MP3 player, and strolled after them at a brisk pace. All the while, the music played:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ooga chaka, Ooga ooga ooga chaka...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Hunter finally caught up to the boys, just as...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>I'm hooked on a feeling...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes ticked away, Hunter was walking and bopping his head to the beat of his mp3 player, even idly singing and grooving to the beat himself.  \"I'm high on believing...that you're in love with m-\" he stopped singing and grooving mid-sentence upon reaching his destination, and discovering the two youths panting and gasping for breath as they slouched forward, catching their breaths while the little energized puppy continued yipping happily.  <i>Oh boy!  That was fun, wasn't it, Kiba?  We haven't raced to the park like that in years!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just laughed, exhausted, but utterly thrilled as he turned towards his equally pooped buddy and gave the boy a thumbs up.  \"I still can't believe you actually beat me this time, Uzumaki!  Nice job!\"  Still catching his breath, Naruto smiled and rubbed the back of his extra fuzzy head bashfully as he said, \"Heehee, thanks, Kiba!  Still, you definitely didn't make it easy!  Heck, that was one of the closest races we've ever had!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter watched the scene as the two boys laugh joyously amongst themselves and couldn't help but smirk himself, before eventually joining up with the gang and interjecting with, \"Well, here we are, boys!  So go ahead and have a ball, I s'pose,\" Hunter said as he walked by the two youths and ruffled the tops of their heads before plopping a seat at a nearby bench.  As he did, both boys turned to each other as Kiba raised his shoulders and asked, \"Welp, Naruto, anything you wanna do now that we're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't say anything for a moment.  Instead, a mischievous grin grew over his face as he bopped Kiba on the shoulder, yelled \"Tag!  You're it!\" and immediately sprinted off.  \"Wha-ohhoho no you don't!\" Kiba finally responded before pursuing after the boy.  The two immediately took pursuit across the park for a fairly decent period of time, with Naruto sprinting as fast as his little legs would take him, and Kiba trailing not far behind, trying to tag him back.  As they ran off, Naruto turned his head over-shoulder and asked, \"Heh, what's wrong?  Can'tcha catch me?\"  Kiba just grinned impishly and rather than just 'tag' the boy, proceeded to pounce at him, yelling \"GOTCHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat concerned, Hunter paused his music and rose from his seat and watched the two take a hearty tumble as they rolled down the grassy slope, but his fear immediately subsided when he paused his music and heard the two boys laughing heartily the whole way down.  Upon landing, both boys landed sided by side against each other and on their backs, panting and laughing as Naruto giggled exhausted and said, \"Hehe, nice one, dog-breathe!\"  Kiba just laughed and said, \"Yeah, but not as nice as-\" and as if earning a second wind, bopped Naruto, startling him as Kiba jumped to his feet and sprinted off, whilst screaming, \"TAG!  Now YOU'RE it, bonehead!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's MY thing!\" joked Naruto before hopping to his feet and taking off after Kiba.  Hunter just smirked as he turned to the pup near him and asked, \"Man, these two can play pretty rough, can't th-\" but before he could finish, Akamaru was already taking off after them, yipping merrily as he took off and pounced against the boys as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just chuckled to himself and shook his head as he sat back down, at ease as the boys and pup laughed and played, (albeit roughly).  As he watched them carry on as playfully and innocently as they did, he couldn't help but smile a bit warmly at the sight.  <i>Those guys are pretty lucky to have such a strong friendship like that</i>, Hunter thought to himself, before once again, hitting the play button...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Cause baby, there aaaain't noooo moooountain hiiiiiiiiiiigh enooooooough...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time just ticked away as the boys and pup ran across the grass, chasing and tackling each other with Akamaru occasionally pouncing across someone's face and knocking them down in a hurry.  After a good amount of time, all of which just ticked by like a second for the three youths, eventually, both Naruto and Kiba had once again landed on their backs side by side, chests rising and dropping rapidly as they panted for breath, and all with hearty smiles across their faces.  In addition to which, the time they'd spent as active as they had seemed to work off whatever was left to work in from their tummies from their earlier escapades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, y'know what, Naruto?  That was some of the most fun I've had in years!\" Kiba exclaims to his blonde friend, just as Akamaru parks his exhausted little body atop Kiba's chest, panting as his tail wagged rapidly.  <i>You're telling me!  I even chased a few dumb squirrels!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba ruffled the pups head before folding his arms behind his head.  \"Took the words right outta my mouth,\" Naruto replied as he chuckled to himself, whilst nodding in agreement.  Resting one arm behind his head and the other on his chest, Naruto turned to both Kiba and Akamaru and in a more sincere tone, said, \"Y'know, I wanna thank you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his head towards Naruto, Kiba raised an eyebrow and asked, \"Hm?  What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, for helpin' me see that being a kid really CAN be fun!  Truth me told, I was...kinda scared when I drank Hunter's vial, cause I thought I'd start remembering all the bad stuff again, and feeling the way I did the first time around...but, I don't.  Because I got you guys, and, I just wanna let you both know how grateful I am, so, thanks, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just smiled warmly and playfully nudged Naruto in the arm as he said, \"Hey, what're friends for, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru just got up and trotted over to Naruto before licking him merrily across the face, earning a ticklish laugh from the boy as he playfully ruffled the pup's head in turn, before Akamaru trotted back and plopped between the two boys.  Shortly after, the trio sighed blissfully as both Naruto and Kiba tilted their heads skyward, staring off peacefully into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more time had gone by, with the boys and pup exhausted and continuing to just lay in peace atop the grass, and Hunter continuing to bop his head to more tunes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen enough time had passed...</span></div></div>",

Coughing and removing his earbuds, Hunter looked down to see Naruto leaning against him, beaming and leaning his hands against the wolf's stomach. \"Oof...hey, Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, the boy looked up at him, grinning so wide his eyes squinted shut. \"Heya, Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing a bit more, Hunter took a few deep breaths to recompose himself before replying, \"So...you got your second wind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Kiba piped up as he came up behind Naruto, arms folded behind his head with Akamaru following close behind. Coming to a stop beside his friend, he looked up and gave Hunter a toothy grin. \"Still can't believe I have so much energy again, though; all it took was a little rest...\" He stretched, smiling as he did so. \"...and I feel like I could run from here to Suna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Naruto took his hands off Hunter's midsection. \"Yeah!\" He exclaimed, hopping up and down in place. \"I feel like I could play all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling in spite of himself, Hunter reached out and ruffled the boys' heads. \"Heh, yeah, that stuff's pretty great, ain't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys nodded emphatically...before they fixed Hunter with mischievous grins. Almost dreading what they might have been planning, Hunter nonetheless asked, \"Um, boys? What're you smiling about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba glanced at one another, giggled, then looked back at Hunter. \"Weeeeell,\" Naruto began, folding his arms behind his head. \"We were thinkin'; since you were nice enough to give us some of that formula...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, getting the drift, grinned even more mischievously. \"...it only makes sense we'd repay the favor,and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, both boys spoke up simultaneously:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask ya to play with us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinked slowly. \"...you want me to play with you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Naruto exclaimed, rocking on his feet a bit. \"I mean,even if you're at your normal age right now, it'd still be fun roughhousing with ya...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"And besides, playing with Akamaru like he is now is a ton of fun, but I kinda feel like playin' around with something that's big and furry...\" Akamaru, from beside Kiba, yapped his agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter took a deep breath. \"W-well,\" he began, scratching the back of his head. \"I-I appreciate it, boys; really, I do, but see, wolves play kinda rough, a-and there's the fact we have a bite pressure of 1500 pounds of pressure per square inch, and if I got too into it, I'd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaase?\" Naruto and Kiba entreated, giving Hunter their widest, toothiest, most hopeful smiles. At this, the wolf's eyes flew wide open, and he began to become short of breath as the unexpected onslaught of cuteness assailed his senses. \"I-I-er, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of Hunter's momentary distraction, Naruto and Kiba took a paw each and eagerly pulled him off the bench, tugging him along until they were out in the grassy field, Akamaru following and barking happily all the way. \"Don't worry, Hunter, we'll be fine!\" Naruto insisted,giggling at Hunter's reaction. \"We're ninja, 'member? We can handle it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't be chicken!\" Kiba added. He smirked, nudging the wolf's side. \"Unless, of course, ya don't wanna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh?\" Hunter mumbled. Shaking his head, he freed himself from his trance and looked down at the two boys. He studied them for a few seconds before, finally, he nodded. \"Alright, I guess I'm game...\" At this, Naruto and Kiba let out a cheer, pumping their arms in the air. \"But,\" he added, the sides of his muzzle twitching upward, \"you two should know something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, the boys lowered their arms, looking up at the anthro curiously. \"What's that?\" Naruto asked, tilting his head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's smirk widened, exposing some of his sharp teeth. \"That there are consequences for using your cuteness against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde boy's eyes widened. \"Wh-wha--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scarcely had time to say anything else before Hunter dropped to all fours, turned toward him, and playfully lunged at him. He stopped within a few inches of him, but the movement was enough to knock Naruto flat on his rump. \"Owww....\" he winced, rubbing the seat of his shorts painfully. Hunter, however, had no intention of giving him any respite; still on all fours, he closed the distance between them in seconds, startling Naruto again, and causing him to fall flat on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perfect,</i> Hunter thought to himself, tail wagging. Grinning mischievously, he got on his knees, reached his paws out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and grabbed the bottom of Naruto's shirt, pulling it up so that his bare tummy (and the belt below it) were showing for the whole world to see. Naruto's eyebrows raised in surprise and confusion. \"H-Hunter? What're you...\" Kiba, who already had an idea of what Hunter was planning, snickered, even as he feared that the same 'punishment' would be visited upon him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Naruto,\" Hunter began casually, eyes gleaming. \"Have you ever been tickled before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-eh?\" Naruto's eyes widened. \"H-Hunter, whaHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys arms and legs began flailing wildly as Hunter reached his paws out and began tickling every part of Naruto's exposed tummy that he could find: the sides, the front, even the belly-button. All the while, the boy laughed uproariously, eyes squeezed shut. \"Hunter, StaHAHAHAHAHAP! That-thaHAHAHAHAHAT ticklHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, unable to keep still any longer, leapt at Hunter's back, eager to 'save' his friend from his 'torment.' However, Hunter spun around with surprising speed, reaching his arms out and pinning Kiba to the ground. As the boy playfully struggled, Hunter looked toward Akamaru. \"Akamaru, if you please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked, wagging his tail. <i>It'd be my absolute pleasure.</i> Prancing over to Kiba, he began climbing up on the boy, stopping right before his hoodie. Eyes widening, Kiba stammered, \"A-Akamaru? What're you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nothin' personal, pal,</i> Akamaru woofed smugly before he ducked down, squirmed underneath the hoodie...and began crawling up Kiba's torso, pulling the hoodie up along with him and exposing more and more bare flesh. By the time Akamaru stopped and hopped off of Kiba, the entirety of his bare tummy was showing, in addition to his black belt. Satisfied, Akamaru looked up at the anthro. <i>All yours.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Akamaru!\" Kiba exclaimed, though his laughs distorted it somewhat. \"You traitAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis protest was cut off as Hunter released Kiba's arms, only to reach his paws out and mercilessly begin tickling the child's bare stomach as well. \"H-hey, that's no faiHAHAHAHAHAHASTOPPIT, STOPPIT! I'm tickliHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Kiba laugh and flail harder, Hunter only grinned and tickled the boy with greater intensity. He was getting so into it that he didn't notice Naruto climbing to his feet behind him, pulling his shirt down, and grinning. Tensing his little legs, Naruto leapt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and landed directly on Hunter's back, the anthro not reacting in time. Eyes widening, Hunter retracted his arms and playfully stood up and grabbed at his back, trying to get the boy off. He twisted and spun about, laughing...only to let out a surprised yelp as Kiba got up and lunged at his legs, knocking him off balance and sending him crashing to the ground. Even as he lay there and adjusted his glasses, though, Kiba, Akamaru, and Naruto leapt upon him in a dogpile. Not planning to give up, though, Hunter began rolling, taking all three youths with him, though if their laughs, giggle, and yips were any indication, they were hardly objecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, all four were laughing, barking, and roughhousing, Hunter sneaking in tickles where he could, with the two boys and pup playfully hitting and nipping at him. They carried on in this fashion for a while, before, finally, all four collapsed back on the ground, arms (and paws) splayed out at their sides as they panted happily, exhausted but happy to be so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Hunter looked from side to side at the two happily-panting boys, and asked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How 'bout you, boy?\"  Akamaru yipped happily, giving Kiba all the answer he needed as he and Hunter turned their attention to Naruto.  \"What about you, little guy?\" asked Hunter.  As if to answer his question, Naruto's tummy let out an audible growl, causing the boy to blush as he rubbed the back of his head, chuckling sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just laughed and playfully patted the boys' shoulder.  \"Then it's settled,\" remarked Hunter as he rose to his feet, adjusted his glasses and dusted himself off.  Both youths simply hopped to their feet, and; likewise to Hunter, dusted themselves off, as Akamaru hopped atop Kiba's head.  And in no time at all, all four were off, inspecting the small little town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked on, Naruto beamed happily at the three others and said, \"Wow-wee, hehehe, I honestly don't remember the last time I had so much fun!\"  Looking down at the boy, Hunter smiled and ruffled the boys fuzzy head.  \"Y'know something?  Same here!  I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm not OLD or anything, like even remotely, but you guys know how it is.  Ya get older and you don't really get to just to roughhousing or playing the way we just did.  Heck, it was kinda\u2026refreshing,\" Hunter admitted, rubbing the back of his head.  Kiba nodded in agreement happily and said, \"Tell me about it!  Even if we ever did, I never had this much energy just firing me up now then at my regular age!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" the anthro wolf replied, then looked down at the two boys and; with a mischievous grin on his muzzle, added, \"Eeehehehehe, not to mention, now I know your ultimate weakness\u2026\"  And to emphasize this, he held his paws up the way he did before he began tickling the two boys, causing their eyes to widen as they both stepped back cautiously, causing the pup atop Kiba's head to snicker as Hunter looked towards him and gave him a subtle wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the wolf stopped in his tracks as his nose twitched, as a certain aroma filled his nostrils.  \"Ohhh, wow...\" he muttered, licking his chops at the mouth watering scent.  Kiba turned curiously and asked, \"Huh?  What're ya-\" and like Hunter, he too, caught a whiff a heavenly and sweet aroma wafting fairly close by.  Sure enough, Akamaru was in the same boat, leaving Naruto scratching his head as he saw his three entranced compatriots.  Finally, his shoulders rose in curiosity as he asked, \"Errr...am I missin' something here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a single one replied.  Instead, they each started 'following' the scent, all their mouths practically watering as they did.  However confused by this scene, Naruto nonetheless just shrugged and followed along the others, looking around to see what it was had them all looking and acting so goofy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as time went on, Naruto caught the scent, and was immediately greeted by a nearby bakery, with several freshly baked pies waiting at a table out front.  Outside, an older man; possibly the owner or chef, was sweeping up outside merrily as he looked up and saw the three youths and anthro-wolf person in glasses glaring in awe.  Surprisingly, he just smiled warmly and put his broom aside.  \"Hehe, yeah, we get that a lot.  What can I do you youngsters for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping himself out of his trance, Hunter adjusted his glasses and worked up a friendly smile.  \"Hiya!  Well, my little pals and I were actually wandering through town looking to find something sweet, and then that heavenly aroma picked up and well...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the older man started laughing as he remarked, \"Well, shoot, son, pies don't get any sweeter than ours.  Come on in, see if there's anything you boys like!  Even the little fella over there,\" he added, pointing at the pup atop Kiba's head, still panting happily from the scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If we're sitting down, then no booths!</i> barked Akamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio grimaced, immediately remembering that earlier onslaught as they nodded, making sure they'd get a table this time.  As they did however, the table with the freshly baked pies caught Naruto's eye as he turned to the older man and asked, \"Hey, Mister, what's going on over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man turned and with a hearty grin, replied, \"That; young man, is a little event we throw every now and then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An event?\" Kiba added, tilting his head curiously.  The man nodded and replied, \"Well, people always say they LOOOOVE pies; that they can eat 'em for days, right?  So, we have people put their money where their mouth is, so to speak.  And we do so, by throwing a pie eating contest.  Rules're simple really.  The contestants who can eat every single pie on their platters win a free 'all-you-can-eat' pass for any day of their choosin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, the two youths and wolf-person shared a glance, while Akamaru whined to himself, already knowing where this situation was leading.  That is, until the man laughed to himself and added, \"Hehe, but I tell ya, boys, awful lotta greenhorns 'round these parts.  Cause to this day, not a single contestant's ever had the stomach to put away these little beauties.  Anywho, come on and see what you boys like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey thought for a moment, then ultimately, they decide to...</span></div></div>",

I mean, it's a lot of pies, and I don't want you getting a stomachache...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked, patting his flat belly. \"Stomachache? Ah, we can handle it. Right, boy?\" Akamaru simply whined from his position atop Kiba's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled, ruffling the top of Kiba's head (and taking care not to knock Akamaru off in the process). \"Eh, I think I'll enter, too...\" he winked at the man. \"...but I wouldn't worry too much about these two. Trust me, they can put it away like nobody's business.\" As if to emphasize this, both boys stomachs rumbled. Rather than wince, though, they simply grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, staring at them, finally sighed, the smile returning to his face. \"Alright; I was startin' to wonder if anyone would come around, anyway.\" Walking over to the long table, he set the paper down on a part of it not filled up with pies. \"Just c'mere, sign the paper, and yer in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly, Naruto and Kiba rushed ahead, leaving a chuckling Hunter to follow them. Within moments, all three of them crowded around the table, pens in hand (the man had been thoughtful enough to provide a few), eagerly scribbling their names down. Once they had, the man nodded, took the paper, and instructed the three of them to sit down in front of the pies. The three of them (and Akamaru, of course) obliged, practically drooling as the delectable scents of the pies assailed their nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter took a deep whiff of a pie in front of him, tail wagging. \"Ooh...smells like apple...\" He licked his chops. \"My favorite...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, likewise, grinned as he took in the scents of the pies. \"Yeah; they also got blueberry, cherry, chocolate cream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, sniffing deeply, giggled. \"I don't care what kind they are; they all smell great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, the man nodded. \"Smell? Heh, wait'll you taste 'em!\" The man looked at his watch. \"Ya won't have to wait long, either; it starts up in ten minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groaned, taking a deep sniff. \"Aw man... that long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, the man ruffled Naruto's head (eliciting a giggle from the boy in the process). \"Ah, don't worry; I know it seems like a bit, but trust me, it'll be worth it!\" With that, the man made his way back inside the bakery, presumably to prepare more pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four passed the ten minutes with small talk, some chatting, and more than a little boasting. Akamaru, for his part, actually looked a little excited; even though he <i>knew</i> how things were going to end up, the pies smelled so <i>yummy</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they chatted, they noticed a few people beginning to show up; the spectators, no doubt. Evidently, they weren't used to seeing a wolf-person and two little kids competing, if their startled looks and confused murmurs to one another were any indication. Hunter couldn't help but smirk. <i>Heh, they have no idea...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few minutes, more and more people began showing up until, finally, there were at least a few dozen people. Hunter raised an eyebrow. <i>Huh; must be a pretty well-known event around here.</i> He grinned, licking his chops. <i>Ah well; least that means more people to watch us win...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the bakery owner/chef emerged. Waving to the spectators, he announced, \"Thank you all for coming, for what is sure to be a contest unlike any other!\" At this, the crowd cheered. \"Will these three...er, gentlemen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And dog,</i> Akamaru added, hopping down from Kiba's head and landing on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...achieve that which no other contestant has before?\" The man smiled, gesturing toward the contestants. \"Let's find out, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the crowd, he continued, \"The rules are simple: the contestants are to eat all the pies before them, as well as the ones that will be brought out. If they can finish, they win, and receive a pass for all the free baked goods they want! There is no time limit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the four, he smiled. \"Good luck, all of you; hope your stomachs are ready.\" At the eager nods from all four, the man turned back to the crowd, raised his arm, and yelled, \"Let the contest begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Naruto, Kiba, and Hunter grabbed the forks that had been provided to them and mercilessly leapt upon their first pies. Akamaru, not wanting to be left out, joined in as well...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The gang was tearing into the pies for about a few seconds tops, and in unison, both the boys, the pup and the wolf-person all stopped for just a moment, as their eyes widened with bewilderment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-this...\" started Hunter, before Naruto giggled joyously and finished for him, \"This is the best pie I've ever eaten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, the owner just smirked proudly and tipped his chef's hat.  \"Nothin' but the absolute finest here, boys,\" he said with pride as the others looked amongst themselves and grinned eagerly.  Within no time at all, the four were tearing through their pies with rapid speed, trying to fit as much of that delicious and perfectly warm pastry into their mouths as they possibly could.  Little Akamaru was practically stuffing his entire head into the plate as his tiny maw chowed down on the warm gooey deliciousness of his classic Cherry Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin no time at all, the four had torn through their first rich, delicious pies with gusto.  \"Mmmm!\" muttered Naruto as he rubbed his tummy happily, \"What was that?  Yummy Meringue Pie?\"  The man just chuckled and said, \"Lemon Meringue, but close enough, young'n.\"  Kiba simply smacked his lips and said, \"Well, if the rest of these are even half as good as these were, something tells me we're gonna REALLY like this contest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter patted his stomach and nodded with agreement, still licking pie crumbs from his muzzle.  \"You said it, kiddo.\"  He then glanced up at the man and added, \"I'll say this much, these were definitely the richest pies I've ever eaten.  Don't suppose we could have something to wash these bad boys down with, could we?\"  But the owner just winked at the wolf and replied, \"Say no more, young fella!\"  With that, he headed back to his shop just briefly, and; almost comically, juggled three pitchers of creamy whole milk, and a bowl of water atop his chefs hat.  \"Afterall, what's dessert with a lil bit'uh milk to wash it all down with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as gracefully as a wild hog, the man managed to shuffle all three pitchers directly before the three bipedal contestants, and the bowl atop his hat directly before the tiny pup.  Naruto and Kiba giggled at the scene.  Even Hunter couldn't help but snicker at the display, but nonetheless, the trio thanked the man and went right to town on their next respective pies.  Each bite was somehow better than the last as more warm, gooey and rich pie slid down their throats and right into their eager tummies.  After a little while, Hunter grabbed his pitcher and chugged away for a brief while to wash down the delectable baked pastry.  Placing his pitcher down, he sighed with relief and wiped his maw with his forearm, before turning his attention to the two youths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike when he was a pup, they both struggled a bit to raise their heavy pitchers, but eventually managed, both chugging away with big hearty smiles on their faces as their little legs kicked about joyously.  <i>Awww, okay, fine, THAT is pretty adorable...</i> Hunter thought as he smirked and watched the two youths carry about happily.  Within no time at all, the boys had placed their pitchers down and sighed happily before tearing into their pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second wave of pies had been all but demolished by the four, and already, it was just barely starting to show, as their stomachs all made the slightest and just barely noticeable bulges beneath each of their shirts.  Even Akamaru's furry little concave tummy had now flattened a bit as more and more pie entered it.  But that didn't slow them down none, not by a long shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately after finishing their second pies, all four were getting to work on their third pies.  Naruto glanced at Akamaru digging his little face into his pie and couldn't help but giggle as he turned to Kiba and said, \"Heehee, y'know, with pies as good as these, I'm almost disappointed we can't just stick our faces into our pans like that.\"  Kiba just snickered and said, \"Knowin' you, ya'd probably get your head stuck in the pan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, that only happened that one time!  How was I supposed to know they made pans that small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was extra large!\" retorted Kiba, laughing heartily.  Naruto just grumbled beneath his breath and grabbed his pie.  \"Pfft, yeah, extra large for a hummingbird!\"  But their bickering immediately subsided when they took a bite of their flavorful pies, causing them to dig right back in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru pulled his head out and started drinking from his waterbowl as he happily yipped.  <i>These things are so good, that I almost don't even care how blimped out we're all gonna be when we finish!</i>  Hunter just chuckled and said, \"Good thing we're not at a booth, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that thought, all four stopped eating mid bite for a moment and stared blankly for a moment, shuddering at the memory...then immediately and happily dove right back into their pies, demolishing the third in no time as they eagerly moved onto their fourth pies.  The crowd of spectators watched ever eagerly as they tore into their pies, all wondering if these boys and canines could pull through or falter like the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The four dug into their fourth pies with gusto, cramming as much of the baked dessert into their waiting maws as they could. This, of course, had less to do with the fact that they were in a competition than the fact that <i>the pies were just that damn good.</i> Apple, banana cream, blueberry...the fresh-baked pies assailed their taste buds with explosions of warmth and sweetness, creating a delightful warming sensation as they swallowed, sending the chunks of pastry and filling down their throats and into their waiting bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mmm, these are so yummy!</i> Naruto thought to himself as he forked a particularly large chunk of pie into his mouth, splattering some blueberry filling on his cheeks. <i>I don't even care whether we win or not!</i> Giggling through his mouthful, he kicked his feet a bit, struck by how much <i>fun</i> he was having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, Kiba grinned happily as he chewed a particularly large mouthful of banana cream pie. <i>Oh man...I really wish the village had bakeries with stuff this good!</i> He grinned even wider at te sight of Akamaru, once again sticking his entire head into a pie (this one peach) and gobbling as much of it up at a time as he could. <i>Heh, don't blame ya buddy...</i> Licking his lips, he dove right back into his pie. Hunter, eagerly scarfing down his apple pie, simply looked at the two boys having the time of their lives as they went to town on their pies and smiled. <i>Aww...look at how happy they are...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, their respective pies had been reduced to empty tins. They only stopped for a quick drink of milk (and water, in Akamaru's case) before leaping into their fifth pies, not losing any speed at all. Soon, the sixteen empty pie tins became twenty. Then twenty-four. Then twenty-eight, thirty-two, thirty-six...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd watched, awestruck, as the bipedal wolf, two young boys, and little puppy devoured pie after pie, only stopping to catch their breath or taking a drink before diving back in. During the previous events, most of the contestants would have at least started slowing down a bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, due to the sheer size of the pies, their tummies continued to be visibly affected by their efforts. The tiny bulges underneath Hunter and Naruto's shirts and Kiba's hoodie slowly grew and grew, making more of an impression as each pie was polished off. In the meantime, Akamaru's tummy flattened more and more, before, finally, it began to curve outward a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, they pressed on, enjoying the tastes and textures of the pies too much to worry too much about the effects they were having on their midsections. As such, they continued gobbling their pies, empty tins continued to pile up, and their bellies slowly bulged bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after they had each polished off a dozen pies each, they each let out satisfied belches and leaned back in their chairs to rest, laying their hands (or paws, in Hunter's case) on top of their bellies. Akamaru, likewise, lay on his side, letting his tongue hang out the side of his mouth. The three bipeds' stomachs had grown considerably, each looking as though they'd swallowed a basketball whole. In Naruto and Kiba's cases, this caused the patterns on their shirt and hoodie (the horizontal stripe and the diagonal yellow 'slash' marks, respectively) to distort a bit as they pressed outwards. Their stomachs were still completely concealed, but if they kept up the pace they'd been going at, that wasn't likely to last long. Akamaru, on the other paw, looked as though he'd once again swallowed a grapefruit whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" Naruto sighed happily, burping. \"I don't think I've ever eaten that many pies at once...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba licked his lips, getting a few crumbs off his face. \"Don't tell me you're slowing down NOW, Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked at Kiba. \"With pies these tasty? In your dreams!\" Kiba smirked in return, belching as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, licking the sides of his muzzle, grinned down at the two boys (and pup). \"Seriously, though; these pies are <i>amazing!</i>\" He laughed, scratching the back of his head. \"You don't think they'd let me have the recipe, do ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching surprisingly loudly for a pup of his size, Akamaru licked his chops and wagged his tail. <i>With pies these fantastic? Doubt it.</i> Laughing, Kiba reached out and scratched Akamaru's grapefruit-sized tummy, causing the dog's leg to kick a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, the owner came up to them. \"Well, boys, color me impressed; I've never seen anyone get past the first round this fast before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed. \"Well, the pies are really tasty, and we're really hungry; it's to be expected, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled and ruffled the boy's head. \"Heh; hope you're right, kiddo, 'cause the next round's gonna be a doozy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, slightly curious, flicked his ears, even as he rubbed his belly with a paw. \"How so?\" Even as he asked the question, though, he noticed a ripple of excitement going through the crowd. <i>Huh, must be pretty big...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, sensing this as well, whined. <i>I've got a really, REALLY bad feeling about this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled, standing back up and rubbing the back of his head. \"Well...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, he returned, wheeling a fairly large cart, which; as soon as the others saw it, practically made all their jaws drop to the table, for on that cart, was four trays.  And on each of those trays was an ample amount of pies...pies which were...substantially larger than the ones they'd just ingested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mighty heave, he planted a tray before each contestant, letting the delicious aroma and overwhelming size sink in from point blank with each one.  Naruto, Kiba, Hunter, even Akamaru; all of them, simply gazed at their trays so wide eyed, that their eyes looked about the size of saucers.  All four just sat there, dumbfounded, in utter and complete silence.  Until finally, Hunter broke the silence...kind of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-t-these...ummm...they're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are freakin' HUGE!\" blurted out Naruto, utterly flabbergasted, earning a laugh from the owner as he nodded and said, \"Yep!  They sure are, kiddo!  Roughly three times the size of the pies you youngsters just ate.  But hey, three times the size means three times the flavor, if ya catch my drift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped back and gestured towards the pies then said, \"Well, bon appetit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, the four just sat there, utterly overwhelmed, earning some silent chatter from the onlookers.  The man just shook his head and chuckled to himself.  \"Yeah, these babies tend to do that to people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...three times as big, huh?\" replied Kiba, nervously grabbing his fork and knife.  Hunter gulped nervously and added, \"I don't think I've ever even <i>seen</i> pies this big before...let alone eaten one...or several...\"  Akamaru whined in agreement as he placed his little paws atop the tray to support himself as he lifted himself up and glanced down at his massive pie.  <i>Am I suppose to eat this thing or...live in it...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, even Naruto was immensely overwhelmed and a bit intimidated, but after what seemed like a timeless moment, he worked up a grin and grabbed his fork and knife.  \"Well, fellas?  These things ain't gonna eat themselves!  Let's do this!\"  exclaimed Naruto, to which Kiba simply glared at the boy and blurted out, \"You see the freakin' size'uh these things?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Naruto just grinned confidently and said, \"Oh boy, do I!  But so what?  We've handled way more than this, and even if these things are...huge, who doesn't love a good challenge, right?\"  His grin turned a bit more eager as he added, \"Besides, ya heard what he said; three times the size means three times the delicious flavor!  And we <i>all</i> know how good these pies are, right?\"  The others glanced amongst themselves, slowly working up grins.  \"They <i>are</i> pretty tasty,\" Hunter added, licking his chops.  Smiling back, Kiba patted Naruto on the shoulder and said, \"Alright, bonehead, I'm with ya.  Let's do this th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than his sentence started, Akamaru had already dug his tiny head into his pie, nearly falling in completely, before sustaining himself and chowing down eagerly.  Laughing, the trio wasted no time in joining the pup as they stuffed their faces with ample mouthfuls of rich, gooey...gigantic pie.  Immediately, their faces lit up as that warm treat slid down their throats, but not before welcoming their mouths with a plethora of sweet, warming flavor.  \"Wow...these are even better than the ones we just ate!\" Kiba exclaimed.  Naruto just giggled merrily and nodded as he added, \"Yuh-huh!  I think these might be the new yummiest pies I've ever eaten!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter simply smiled and turned to the owner.  \"My complements to the chef!\" he said merrily before he and the others resumed stuffing their faces with newfound vigor and once again; in rapid speed.  The man just tipped his hat gratefully and said, \"Like I said, son, nothin' but the ab-so-lute finest at our table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin no time at all, they had managed to tear down their first massive pie, and all pulled out the next pies, (or in Akamaru's case, have Kiba pull it for him due to their sheer massive size) and already, they were going to town on the next one, overwhelmed not by the size, but by the pure delicious flavor greeting the insides of their mouths.  However, while the size wasn't taking its' toll on the contestants yet, it had already begun to take a toll on their bellies, as those basketball sized bulges the three bipedal contestants tummies were making had grown more and more, to the point where just a slight sliver of flesh could be seen beneath their shirts, or in Hunter's case, brown fur.  And little Akamaru's tummy continued swelling outward to a more and more rounded state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, not a single one let that stifle them as they continued into a mixture of tearing into their pies and occasionally drinking milk or water for Akamaru to wash down their delicious treats before hopping right on back for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time pressed on...</span></div></div>",

Shaking his head, he swallowed and continued tearing into his pie. <i>Man, I can't get enough of this stuff!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, likewise, was wagging his tail as he dug into a particularly moist blueberry pie. <i>Wow...I definitely gotta come back here sometime, if only for these pies!</i> He burped, but he simply licked his chops and dug back into the pie. <i>Definitely didn't expect this when I came here...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, his head stuck a good ways into a banana cream pie, wagged his tail. <i>I'm probably gonna look like a friggin <b>beach ball</b> by the time I'm done all the pies...</i> he whined a bit at this realization...before wagging his tail again and diving back in. <i>...but I don't care! They're all so yummy!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ripped into their third pies, the pastries continued taking their toll on their tummies; slowly, the three bipeds' stomachs bulged bigger and bigger, gradually causing their shirts (or hoodie, in Kiba's case) to pull further upwards and expose more skin (or fur, in Hunter's case). Obviously, in both the boys' cases, the fact that some of their bare tummies were showing meant that their belts were fully visible as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Akamaru's case, his tummy continued swelling, growing bigger and rounder as more and more pie entered his gullet. It slowly began to hang a bit more under him, and the pup swore he could feel his back legs beginning to become forced apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, each of their third pies were polished off. Licking their lips (and muzzles), they prepared to retrieve their fourth pies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...when the three bipeds winced slightly. \"Uh...\" Naruto began, rubbing his belly. \"Anyone else's pants beginning to feel a little tight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba felt around his belly, which was beginning to press against his pants. \"Yeah, just a bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter winced as he massaged his belly. \"Well, whaddaya expect when you've downed a dozen pies and three giant pies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, lying on his side with a noticeably larger belly that forced his back legs apart somewhat and stuck out a bit in front of him a bit, whined. <i>Ya look like you're carrying puppies, that's what...</i> In spite of his words, Akamaru had caught the scent of several of his pies that set him to salivating. What was more, he wasn't even feeling full yet! Who knew how pregnant he'd end up looking by the time he was done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked. \"Well, I dunno about you guys, but I don't wanna sit around any longer than I hafta without eating more of these awesome pies.\" Reaching his paws down to his waistline, he fumbled around with the front of his shorts before he got a handle on his button. Grinning, he undid his button, sighing in relief as his tummy bulged out a bit more and forced his zipper down a few teeth, pushing his shirt up a little more and exposing more belly-fur. \"Ahhhh....that feels better.\" Smiling, he looked at the two boys. \"What about you two? You unbuckling and unbuttoning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba got thoughtful looks on their faces. On the one hand, if they unbuttoned and unbuckled now, they'd be able to continue eating more and more of the delicious pies uninhibited. On the other hand, the snugness, while a bit uncomfortable, wasn't anywhere near painful, and undoing their belt and pants now felt almost like they were giving up. Besides, they'd skipped out on busting their clothes, at least intentionally, at the steak place, and they'd never busted a belt before; what did it feel like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Hunter spoke up, looking at them expectantly. \"What're you boys gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Naruto and Kiba grinned at each other and looked up at Hunter. Happily, they declared...</span></div></div>",

My stomach was friggin' <i>killing</i> me when I tried to pop my button off my pants as a pup,\" Hunter warned them.  Both boys laughed and waved their arms dismissively.  \"We know it might hurt a little bit, but that's the fun!  We just fight through the pain and bust these bad boys to their limits!\" exclaimed Kiba proudly.  \"And if it gets <i>way</i> too bad, we can always just unbutton and unbuckle,\" Naruto said, before grinning and patting his tummy with anticipation, \"but something tells me we'll manage.\"  After a moment passed, Hunter's muzzle worked up a smile as he ruffled both boys heads and said, \"Well, if you kids are sure you can handle it.\"  And as if to remind them that there were pies to be demolished, all four of their bellies rumbled eager for more.  \"Let's get this show on the road then!\" exclaimed Hunter, before all four jumped back into their pies (literally in Akamaru's case)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the additional room Hunter freed up, his belly was allowed room to extend a little more freely as he wolfed down (no pun intended) more and more of his deliciously gooey and immense pie.  <i>Seriously, that guy HAS to share this recipe...</i> he thought to himself; tail wagging, as he gulped down another ample mouthful of pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, on the other hand, was a bit more distracted as he occasionally pulled his pie-jelly stained head from the pan and glanced back at the boys, who were more than eagerly stuffing their faces and down to their ever increasing midsections.  Both boys had reached the point where their tummies were now being constricted by their belts AND the button accompanying the front of their pants, and seeing the two wince slightly once they reached that capacity made the pup whine a bit more.  <i>I just hope these two don't get a tummyache...</i>  Akamaru mused to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his woes were quickly subsided as the sound of the two youths giggling happily filled his little ears.  <i>Well, least they're having fun...</i>   Tail wagging at the sight and joyous laughter, Akamaru stuffed his head right back into the pie, as his own white furred belly continued to swell, until; without a doubt, he was now forced to separate his hind legs apart to allow his swelling tummy more space.  <i>Ugh, I just hope I don't end up rolling off the table once this is done...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Naruto and Kiba continued to gulp down more and more pie, regardless, feeling their bellies expand with every few hearty mouthfuls gulped down, exposing more and more flesh, and doubly exposing how tight their belts were getting.  Eventually, the two youths, now feeling their belts and buttons constrict the lower half of their bellies, glanced at each other and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Kiba...\" Naruto started, grin growing ever more impish as his young mind started formulating a scheme, \"whadduya say we make a little game of this?\"  Kiba raised an eyebrow and turned to his blonde friend, already putting it together.  Nevertheless, he grinned and replied, \"All ears, bonehead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These things are getting more and more snug, but I think if we keep at it a lil longer, we'll bust 'em right off the hinges!  Soooo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna see which one of us can bust our belt and pop our button first?\" replied Kiba bluntly, earning an eager nod from the young blonde.  \"Don't we usually tie every time we try crap like this though?\"  Naruto shrugged innocently and replied, \"That doesn't make it any less fun, does it?\"  And after a moment of silence, Kiba grinned toothily and said, \"Hehe, then let's do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if getting a second wind, both boys quickly dug their forks and knives into the remains of their pies and gobbled up more and more mouthfuls as a quicker pace, causing their tummies to swell up at a quicker rate as well, which caused them to wince ever more as their guts pressed deeper and deeper against their uncompromising belt buckles.  But that didn't stop them even remotely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing their fourth pies before Akamaru and Hunter, both boys placed their pans aside and grabbed their fifth each, licking their lips eagerly before they dug in.  After working on their fifth for a little while, Naruto stopped and reached for his pitcher of milk, hoisting it up to his lips after a brief but adorable little struggle, and quickly began chugging down hearty gulps of milk.  Watching his friend chug away, Kiba stopped eating pie for a moment to do the same.  \"Heh, smart thinkin', bonehead,\" remarked Kiba as the young dog-nin grabbed his own pitcher and started chugging away.  Both boys winced even more, visibly in a bit more pain as their bellies pushed against their belt buckles more and more, but neither one was willing to let up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter chugging their pitchers for a good while, Naruto heartily slammed his still fairly full pitcher back on the table with both hands and burped loudly, blushing slightly and earning a chuckle from Kiba as he placed his pitcher on table and wiped his mouth with his forearm before turning to Naruto and saying, \"Heh, excuse yo*uuUUUUUUUUURRRP!*\"  Kiba's remark was interrupted as he accidentally let out a surprisingly massive belch.  Immediately, the young dog-nin clamped his hand over his mouth and blushed redder than a ripe tomato as Naruto grabbed his currently bloated sides and burst into a fit of laughter.  Even Hunter and Akamaru couldn't help but snicker amongst themselves.  <i>Hehe, good one, buddy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this humiliating outburst was interrupted when the sound of metal cracking slightly caught the ears of all four parties.  Eagerly, both Naruto and Kiba looked down as the cracking grew louder, until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto and Kiba grinned at the sight of their belt buckles, being pressed against by their swollen bellies, quivering violently. Slowly, the metal cracked, growing louder and louder with each one, the leather connecting the buckles audibly and visibly tearing. The crowd watched, flabbergasted; those boys were actually going to break their <i>belts</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, even as he forked more pie into his muzzle, wagged his tail as the cracking and ripping grew louder and louder. <i>Heh heh; whether one of them ends up busting their buckle first or they do it at the same time, it's bound to be epic...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, pulling his head out of his massive pie, had the opposite reaction as he glanced at the two and whined. <i>Oh man...I just KNOW at least one of their belt buckles is gonna hit someone...</i> Gulping, he dug his head back into the pie, not wanting to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba, oblivious to either of their canine companions' inner musing, watched with growing anticipation as their belts continued to rip, and the metal buckles continued to crack. The cracks and rips continued to grow louder and louder, until, finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....Kiba's eyes flew wide open as his belt frayed and tore, each side of his belt flying to the sides and sticking out out beside his belly as his buckle <i>exploded</i> off his waist, sending a much-needed jolt of relief through his waistline even as his stomach pressed harder against his pants. The metal object sailed clear above the table and straight into the crowd....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...where, evidently, it  struck some unfortunate spectator in the crowd. Akamaru, even with his head in the pie, whined. <i>Yep, knew it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, even as his own belt buckled continued to crack and rip, gaped at Kiba, unbelieving that the dog-nin had managed to bust his buckle ahead. Scowling, he leaned over to the other boy and opened his mouth to utter a protest, but a rather loud ripping stopped him. Startled, he looked down at his own belt buckle....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and followed it as it burst off his waist, sailed over the table and into the crowd....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...where it once again struck somebody; the same poor sap who had apparently gotten hit by Kiba's buckle, if the voice was any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd, wincing, simply stared back at the boys; exactly how much pressure had they built up for their buckles to come flying off like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, gaping at the sight of Naruto's buckle flying into the crowd,  nonetheless managed to compose himself. Settling back in his seat, he smirked at Naruto. \"Heh; looks like I busted my buckle first, eh, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glared back at the dog-nin. \"H-hey, don't give me that! W-we still hafta bust our...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling an immense tightness in their waists, both boys immediately stopped what they were doing and looked down at their waistlines. The release of their belt buckles, in addition to hiking their shirt and hoodie up a little higher, to the point where a tiny bit of their navels were beginning to show, had caused their bellies to bulge out slightly, pressing harder than ever against their shorts and pants. As a result, their buttons quivered violently, putting up a valiant effort to hold back the swelling appendages. Their arguments with each other forgotten, Naruto and Kiba once again stared eagerly at their pants, watching with rapt attention as the threads loosened, and their buttons quivered harder and harder, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...as one, their buttons gave and blasted off their pants, once again sailing over the table and into the crowd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, that's not fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and once again striking the unfortunate spectator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the loss of their buttons, Naruto and Kiba sighed and grinned like dopes as their bellies surged out, unzipping their flies a bit and forcing their upper garments up high enough to rest just above their belly-buttons. Letting their arms hang at their sides, they sank into their chairs. \"Oh man, that feels SO much better...\" Naruto exclaimed breathlessly, bringing a hand up to massage his tummy. Kiba, letting his head tilt back and his tongue hang out of his mouth, simply nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned gleefully, tail wagging even faster as he watched the two. <i>Oh man, I was right; that WAS epic!</i> Chuckling, he continued forking pie into his mouth, not taking his eyes off the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the boys' eyes opened wide, and they looked back at each other, then their missing buttons, and then back at each other again. Then, as one, they burst into hysterical laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh man!\" Naruto managed through his laughter. \"W-we actually popped our buttons at the same time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Kiba gave his belly a few hearty pats. \"Well, considering I broke my belt first, guess it only makes sense another part of our clothes gives at the same time!\" He belched rather wetly, which only served to widen his grin. \"Oh man, I feel amazing! All that pressure...just gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto giggled in return and patted his belly with both hands. \"Yep! I feel like I could eat a dozen more of these monsters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, both Naruto and Kiba looked down to see the states their bellies and clothes were in. Their stomachs had bulged noticeably bigger after breaking their belts (the ruined halves of which now stuck out and curved around their midsections to either side, to the point where they appeared to be framing them), their shirt and hoodie exposing their navels in their entirety, but not much else above them. Their shorts and pants, sans buttons, were unzipped by a few teeth, though not just enough to start showing their undergarments...yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the boys' grins, Hunter interjected, \"Heh, doin' good, fellas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto beamed up at the anthro-wolf. \"Hee hee, thanks, Hunter, but we're nowhere near done yet!\" Licking his lips, he once again grabbed his fork and knife and immediately resumed digging into his pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, that's no fair!\" Kiba protested, grabbing his fork and knife. \"I wasn't ready!\" Grumbling, he, too, dove back into his pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Hunter smiled. <i>Well, when in Rome...</i> With that thought, he turned back to his own pie and continued digging into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, having pulled his head out to see what all the commotion was about, simple shook his head and wagged his tail. <i>Heh; totally called it.</i> Once again, his tummy rumbled, and he stuck his head back into his pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spectators, even the one who had been beaned by the buckles and buttons, watched with rapt attention. How much longer were they going to be able to keep this up?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both Akamaru and Hunter were gradually catching up to Naruto and Kiba as the two polished off their fourth pies and immediately jumped onto their fifth each.  The two youths, having done quick work of their fifth pies due to their second wind, put their adrenaline rush to use as they plowed through their fifth pies in no time at all, and immediately jumped at their sixth pies, tearing chunk after chunk right from the gooey sweet delight and gulping it down with gusto.  All the while, their tummies continued to blimp right up, causing their respective shirts to continue to slowly hike upward more and more after each mouthful going down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spectators all watched in astonishment as these two youths and two canines continued to tear down one pie after another in rapid succession.  Up til now, not a single contestant had ever kept up such momentum.  Then again, not a single contestant built enough pressure to snap their belt buckles and pants buttons...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for a good while, as all four were on the same boat now.  Six pies down became seven pies, and seven became eight, and eight became nine...but once these four had reached their ninth pies, that rapid eager pace starting to turn to a scene of familiarity for the spectators.  Their pace had decreased tremendously.  Their moves were now sluggish, tried.  But so few people had ever come this far that everyone watched all the same, more invested than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut boy oh boy, was the amount of pie in their bellies taking its' toll on all four contestants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Naruto and Kiba's bellies had bloated to the point where their shirt and hoodie had each risen well above their belly buttons, as their stomachs pushed outward enough to push down the zippers in the front of their pants exposing their 'uniquely patterned' undergarments, not that either one really cared at this point.  Hunter was more or less on the same boat, his tanktop well above his furred over navel as his immensely swollen brown furred gut pushed out, utterly packed with pie and the occasional gulping of milk.  And little Akamaru's tummy had rounded out enough to where it was beginning to touch the table and press firmly against the pie pans.  It wouldn't be long before the little white pup was a furry bowling ball at this rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four continued, ever slowly tearing off smaller and smaller pieces of pie and taking a bit more effort than before to gulp each bite down.  And with each passing bite, their gullets grew more and more drum tight as it continued to carry on beyond capacity.  Finally, the four gradually stopped altogether for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh....so...much...p-pie...\" groaned Hunter as he tried to lift a fork up to his paw, but stopped and groaned in discomfort some more as he sat back and began rubbing his belly soothingly, trying to coax away enough pain to wolf down (again...no pun intended) what was left of his ninth.  The others fared no better, all seemingly dazed from so much pie being ingested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, guys, w-we can't quit now, we're so close,\" said Naruto as he looked back and saw the others catching their breath.  \"Nah, we ain't giving up yet, bonehead, but we need a breather first...l-least, I do...\" groaned Kiba as he rubbed his own tummy in a daze.  Akamaru whined to himself as he looked down at the remains of his ninth pie.  <i>I'm seriously half tempted to just take a nap in one of these things...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhining just slightly to himself, Hunter glanced at what was left of his ninth pie, then back at his tray, realizing each one still had ONE more whole pie left to go after they had finished their ninth...if ever they would.  \"On second thought, they can keep their recipe...if ever I had it, I'd have my own gravitational pull...\" remarked Hunter, to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst the others were catching their breath, Naruto decided to try and soldier on, despite his own belly feeling fuller than ever.  And so, the young boy forcefully tore a piece of pie out and; however reluctant, opened nice and wide and started chewing away before gulping it down and moving onto his next piece, then his next...and his next, trying his best to finish his ninth pie as soon as possible before fullness <i>really</i> caught up with him...which, unfortunately, happened sooner than Naruto was expecting or hoping it to do.  Upon gulping down his latest mouthful of pie, Naruto's eyes widened as his stomach lurched audibly, making the boy lean back and grip his belly with one hand as it gurgled quite audibly.  And just then, to everyone's alarm, the young man appeared as though green in the face as he clamped his one free hand over his mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naruto...?!\" started Kiba, concerned for his buddy and woeful of what he feared was about to happen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" remarked Hunter, wincing nervously as the sight.  Even Akamaru whined and ducked his head back into his pan.  <i>I can't watch...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's cheeks bulged outward a noticeable amount as the contestants, the spectators and even the owner alike inched back, not wanting to see what they all feared was about to transpire...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead, Naruto's mouth flung wide open...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and out came a massive, queasy sounding belch.  The others just glared as the disgusting sound carried on for several seconds, making the boys' belly shake from the sheer force, enough so to actually cause the front of Naruto's pants to rip just slightly, but not enough for anyone to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Naruto's burp reached its' end, the boy sighed with immense relief and leaned back in his chair.  \"Phew...MUCH better!\"  exclaimed Naruto as he patted his belly happily with both hands.  He then looked up at the gaping stares from the spectators; both astonished and disgusted by what just happened, then turned and saw the owner in the side ringing out his ears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Naruto's shoulders sank a bit as he chuckled nervously.  \"Ehehe...e-excuse me...\" the boy said apologetically to the crowd and owner as he rubbed the back of his head sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru just gaped for a moment.  <i>Goodness, Naruto!  What on EARTH did you ea-oh right...pies.  Several...massive...apartment sized...pies.  Gotcha.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, Naruto felt Kiba playfully jab his arm as he said, \"Haha, jeez, man!  Next time, warn us!  Ya almost gave me a heart attack!\" Kiba exclaimed, laughing as he did.  Again, the boy blushed a bit and said, \"Heh, sorry bout that.\"  But to his surprise, Hunter reached over and ruffled the boys head.  \"Hey, don't feel too bad.  I didn't think a kid your age could EVER make a sound like that.  You at least feeling better now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy nodded eagerly and, to his surprise, said, \"Yep!  In fact...I think that actually made some room for more pie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if to accentuate this point, the boy turned to his pie and immediately dug in for more at a quicker pace than he was initially going not too long ago.  Kiba, Hunter and Akamaru just watched for a moment as Naruto continued tearing away more and more pie.  Akamaru tilted his little head, impressed.  <i>Wow, look'it him go...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the remains of his own pie, then back at his ridiculously rounded middle, then whined.  <i>I don't think I have any more room...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba groaned a bit himself as he nodded in agreement, scratching the pup's head as he did.  \"Same here, boy...I mean, I <i>want</i> to eat more, but I feel like if I eat another bite, I might actually explode...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled to himself as he watched Naruto continue trailblazing onward.  \"Well, at least Naruto managed to make some room,\" he said, chuckling as he did.  As soon as he said that, all three turned to each other for a moment, all with the same thought in mind...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Almost as one, the two canines and boy grinned as the same idea occured to them all at once. After all, even if they felt like they were going to explode, they didn't want to stop, not after they'd come so far...and besides, the pies were just too damn tasty to let go to waste<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd watched, dumbfounded, as Hunter began kneading his swollen belly, taking deep breaths as he did so. That confusion only increased as Kiba grinned and began doing the same to his belly with one hand, the other gently pushing Akamaru over on his side (and causing his ridiculously rounded tummy to lay out on the table) and kneading his the dog's tummy. Naruto, oblivious, continued tearing into his pie, not wanting to waste his second wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, Hunter and Kiba continued kneading their (and Akamaru's) tummies, taking deep breaths all the while. Feeling the pressure slowly grow, they kneaded even faster  and taking even bigger gulps of air. This, finally, caused Naruto's eyes to flick over to them, even as he continued shoveling pie into his mouth. <i>Eh? What're they doing?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the pressure in the other three contestants' bellies had grown nearly unbearable, but they continued on. Finally, they felt a rather familiar gurgling in their bellies. Eyes gleaming in anticipation, Hunter, Kiba, and Akamaru looked at each other, took a deep breath, tilted their heads back....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BURRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and let their muzzles (and mouth) fly wide open as three loud, queasy belches, easily rivaling Naruto's in length and intensity, exploded out of them. The empty pie tins on the table rattled, and the table itself even vibrated a bit. Their bellies also vibrated, causing the front of Hunter's shorts and Kiba's pants to rip a bit, much as Naruto's had done. Naruto, no longer able to ignore what was going on, looked up from what was left of his ninth pie and turned his head, gaping at the sight of the belches STILL escaping from the other three's mouths. The crowd, for their part, stared at the three in a mix of awe and disgust; those had to be some of the loudest burps they'd ever heard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after several long seconds, the burps wound down, and as one, Hunter, Kiba, and Akamaru sighed, leaned back in their chairs (or rolled onto his back, in Akamaru's case), and smacked their lips. \"Ahhh,\" Hunter muttered, licking his muzzle and gently rubbing his tummy with a paw. \"That was a good one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba beamed, patting his stomach heartily. \"Heh, you're tellin' me; that had ta be some kinda record!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, for his part, simply shook his head, eyes wide. <i>Who knew I had a burp of THAT size in me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, his pie forgotten for the moment, turned to the others, eyes wide. \"Uh...guys?\" he finally spoke up, blinking. \"What was that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Heh; ain't it obvious, Uzumaki? We saw ya belch and start trailblazin' through what was left of your pie, and we figured, why not try it ourselves?\" He grinned widely. \"Besides, these pies are too good to let go to waste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded, rubbing his tummy with both paws and grinning. \"And it worked! I feel like I could take on a bunch more pies now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru wagged his tail, his own stomach feeling rather freed-up. <i>Heh, weeeellll, let's just focus on what's left of our pies right now...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned, helping his buddy back to his paws, giggling as the pup's tummy noticeably touched the table. \"Hee hee, took the words right outta my mouth!\" Taking up his fork and knife again, he began tearing into the remains of his ninth pie with renewed gusto. Hunter, wagging his tail eagerly, did the same, with Akamaru digging his own face back into his own pie. Naruto watched them for only a couple of seconds before he shrugged and got back to his own pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd watched in awe as the four, who had seemed on the verge of giving up before, proceeded to demolish what was left of their ninth pies. No one had ever gotten that far before, much less on such a powerful second wind! If that second wind lasted long enough for them to finish their tenth and final pies, they'd be the first contestants to ever win the contest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin record time, their ninth pies had been reduced to empty pie tins. Licking their lips (and muzzles,) they pushed the empty tins away, only to pull their tenth and final pies toward them. \"Welp, this is it, boys,\" Hunter muttered, eying his pie intensely. \"You ready to win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba licked their lips eagerly. \"Oh yeah,\" Naruto replied, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it!\" Kiba exclaimed, picking up his fork and knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, whining as he felt his belly pressing a bit more noticeably against the table, eyed his final pie. <i>Well...guess it's time to become a fuzzy bowling ball again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four shared determined looks, nodded, then dove into their final pies. The crowd watched all the while, riveted; were these guys actually going to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The entire crowd grew silent with anticipation as the four competitors drew to the close of the contest, venturing unknown territory that would separate them from the chaff that had tried and failed before them.  Even the owner watched on the side, ever anxious to see if these four unconventional contestants could overcome his infamous yet oh so delicious and massive pies.  But the four paid no heed to any of this, as they were far too invested in this final task.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir second wind had pulled them each through the half way point of their tenth and final pies each.  As they began venturing into the second half, again, they had begun to slow down once more, as their bellies were now well beyond maximum capacity.  A few rips here and there could be heard as the front of each bipeds' lower attires, but they were far too determined to pay any heed to that either, each one taking forkful after forkful of pie and scarfing it down vigorously.  Akamaru would occasionally stop and whine, feeling his tummy expand outward more and more, gradually until it reached the point where his belly was actually beginning to lift his little hind paws off the table, forcing him to lean onto his pie bowl infinitely tighter for support.  <i>*URP!*  Ugh, m-maybe this is how they determine different bowling ball sizes...I was a size eight before I got to work on this one, which means by the time I'm done, I'll be a size twenty...and I don't think they even make bowling balls that big...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys and wolf-fella fared no better, each one sluggishly working through each grueling forkful, temporary rewarded by a warm burst of delicious flavor, and immediately back into the discomfort of total fullness.  Occasionally, they'd stop and catch their breath, or force themselves to down a little more milk to help wash down a mouthful of pie, or have a sudden green look to their faces, only to belch loudly and relieve however much pressure in their bellies as they could before working on their pies once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued soldiering on, but stopped for a moment and winced peculiarly down at his swollen belly, grasping the middle of his tummy curiously.  There was an odd sensation coming from around his belly button.  A tightness.  Not a particularly painful tightness, but a...peculiar one.  \"Huh,\" Naruto started, \"the middle of my tummy feels kinda weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba gulped down his mouthful of pie and snickered at the realization that Naruto had actually said 'tummy', but then noticed his was also feeling odd.  \"Y-yeah, me too,\" he remarked, clutching his middle oddly.  Hunter nodded, feeling his own furry belly with his paw.  Then, in perfect synchronization, the trio's faces lit up as they each shared an impish grin, knowing exactly what was about to happen to them.  <i>Oh man, this is gonna be EXTRA epic...</i> Hunter mused, snickering to himself as his tail wagged happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time at all, the trio immediately dove into their pies, however uncomfortable it may have been, and tried their best to speed up the pace as they ate more and more.  Akamaru, sensing this, glanced curiously at the trio, then; to his own surprise, found himself eating faster, so as not to fall behind.  All the while as they ate, that odd tightness felt tighter and tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis burst of energy was short lived for all four, but thankfully, after a few quick, ample mouthfuls of pie consumed, that tightness in the bellies of the trio grew tighter and tighter, until finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd gasped as Naruto, Kiba and Hunter all jerked back as a surge of pressure forced each of their belly buttons to pop outward as wobbly appendages.  The owner just scratched his head at the sight.  \"That's...different,\" he said to himself as he raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if a wad of pressure had just been alleviated from their bellies, the trio sighed with immense relief and leaned back in their chairs.  \"Oh man, it's like a boulder just got lifted off my stomach,\" Hunter said blissfully as he patted his bloated belly, causing his navel to wobble a bit.  He then turned to the boys who were now giggling merrily.  \"Heehee, I forgot how much this tingles!\" mused Kiba, feeling his own inverted navel wobbling comically, making the young dog-nin laugh some more.  Hunter couldn't help but smile at the merry sight of the two previously sluggish boys just carrying on so happily.  Even a few reluctant \"D'awww's\" could be heard from anonymous spectators watching the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Naruto beamed up at the others and said, \"Welp, I dunno about you guys, but with all that pressure just gone, I'm about ready to finish this thing off!  Who's with me?\"  Kiba playfully punched Naruto's arm and said, \"Right beside ya, Uzumaki!\"  Hunter grinned and said, \"Let's do this, boys!\"  And with their THIRD wind, they went back to town on the remains of their respective pies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, the remains of the once massive pies depleted more and more, as each pan grew closer and closer to empty.  Finally, with a great gasp of astonishment from the crowd, the trios pans were completely licked clean.  Naruto, Kiba and Hunter all leaned back in their chairs, and belched quite loudly each, before their hands (and paws) rested atop their ridiculously swollen bellies.  Suddenly, a fourth, much louder burp erupted from besides them as they saw Akamaru now resting on his back, completely dazed, little paws limp in the air as his bloated furry tummy bulged comically above him, once again giving him a bowling ball-like look.  <i>So....much....pie....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, his pan was just as empty as theirs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two boys, this one puppy and humanoid wolf person had done what no one else in this village could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...After the briefest silence, the crowd erupted with cheers for the gangs victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did it!\" cheered Naruto happily, earning a grin from Kiba as he turned to his friend and said, \"Pffft, as if there was ever any doubt.\"  Hunter leaned back in his chair, gently massaging his swollen tummy then gave the boys a thumbs up.  \"Great job, boys.  You two did fantastic!\"  Naruto rubbed the back of his head and said, \"Aww, thanks!  You did too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the applauds and cheers faded as the owner approached the contestants, smiling widely at them.  \"In all my day, I would'uh NEVER guessed anyone could eat that much pie!\"  Naruto smiled and opened his mouth to thank the man, but instead, accidentally let out a massive belch, causing him to blush furiously as he smiled apologetically at the unphased man.  Kiba laughed then said, \"Heh, I think what my pal here means is, with pies this yummy, it was impossible to stop!\"  The man just laughed heartily and ruffled the two youngsters heads playfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thank you.  Mighty kind words, boys,\" said the man as he stepped before the crowd and added, \"I dunno 'bout the rest'uh y'all, but if these pair'uh youngsters, their pup and this here young...wolf...fella, can pack away THIS much pie, then they've earned these!\"  With that, he handed the trio their passes.  \"And here's one for the lil fella,\" he added, handing them one more pass before stepping aside.  \"Let 'em hear it one more time, folks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, the crowd erupted with cheers of congratulations.  Hunter's tail wagged at the scene as Kiba smiled back at the crowd.  But Naruto, simply sat in awe.  Kiba turned and; to his surprise, saw Naruto's dumbfounded face.  \"Hey, you okay, Naruto?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...\" Naruto started, feeling a little choked up, much to Kiba's temporary alarm, \"...when I was a kid last time, I always used to just...dream up moments where people would be happy and proud of me and not...the way they were...but to actually experience it...and as a kid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smiled and placed his hand atop his friends' shoulder.  \"Feels good, don't it?\"  Naruto blinked his brief tears away and smiled right back before turning the crowd and waving happily at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while and some doing, the trio got up and; after Kiba had picked up his much heavier bowling ball sized pup, decided to head back to the inn.  Kiba struggled, but managed to put Akamaru inside his hoodie, allowing him to rest atop Kiba's bloated tummy which he supported with one hand whilst grabbing his pants with the other.  <i>When we're back, I'm gonna seriously need a tummy rub...</i> whined Akamaru as he looked up at Kiba who smiled back at the pup and said, \"Sure thing, boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, man, I dunno about you guys, but with this much pie in my belly the first thing I'm gonna do is have a nice, loooong food coma,\" said Hunter, cradling his own furry belly with one paw as held his shorts with his other.  Naruto, doing the same, turned to the (currently) elder anthro and said, \"Umm, Hunter...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter turned to the young blonde and asked, \"What's up, little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...wanted to thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf person tilted his head curiously.  \"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For this...second chance,\" Naruto started, \"I never ever thought I could enjoy being a kid after my first run at it, but today, I not only learned to have fun and enjoy being a kid, I...I got to see and feel what it was like to not be hated by crowds of people.  To be, liked, admired...for people to be happy for me instead of hating me, and I wouldn't have gotten that second chance if it weren't for you, so...so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Kiba's, Akamaru's, and especially Hunter's surprise, the boy rushed over to the wolf's side and gave him a surprise hug (even if one hand quickly went back to keep his lower garments from plopping off).  \"...Thank you,\" he said gratefully.  Initially hesitant, Hunter eventually smiled back and ruffled the boy's head.  \"Heh, no problem, kiddo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you big sap,\" said Kiba playfully, unable to suppress a smile at the sight, then added, \"Now, whadduya say we head back before our pants completely bust?\"  With a brief shudder of embarrassment, the others nodded and eventually made their way back to the inn...</span></div></div>",

Not to mention, it means your shrinkage is gonna start soon...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gave Hunter a look. \"Shrinkage? Seriously?\" He shook his head. \"Couldn't you have come up with something el-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, Naruto felt his shorts become a bit looser. Eyes widening, his hands flew down to his waist, grasping it so they didn't fall down around his ankles. Kiba, noticing this, tilted his head. \"Eh? What's wrong, Naru-\" Suddenly, he felt his own shorts loosen, and he, too, grasped at them to keep them up. \"Wh-whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled. \"Yep, it's starting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened. \"Y-you mean...\" he looked down at his shirt, eyes widening; sure enough, it was already starting to become rather baggy, as was Kiba's shirt. He gave himself a once-over; unless he missed his guess, he was a little shorter, too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru wagged his tail eagerly. <i>Yep; pretty soon, you guys are gonna look just like you did when we started at the academy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter wagged his own tail as he noticed the two slowly but surely beginning to shrink. \"Yeah, and I bet you'll have adorableness to match...\" Naruto and Kiba flushed a bit at this, but examined themselves again; as they'd suspected, their shirts had become even baggier, and they had to work a bit to hold onto their shorts, which were becoming rather baggy as well. Then, their attention went to the room around them; sure enough, the room seemed to be growing a good deal bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba continued examining themselves and the room, more than a little awed as they continued to shrink and the room continued to grow bigger. In addition, though neither Kiba nor Naruto could feel it, Akamaru and Hunter could see their faces adjusting and changing, losing their rough edges and becoming softer and more rounded in appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked around him, marvelling as the room became bigger and bigger. \"Wow, this is weird...\" His eyes widened, and a hand flew to his mouth; his voice had become a good deal lighter and higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed. \"Yeah, but it's cool!\" he replied, his own voice having become noticeably lighter. Akamaru simply wagged his tail; unless he missed his guess, the two were now at the age they'd been when they'd first graduated the academy. And what was even better, they still had a ways to go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, enraptured, laughed. \"You guys holding up OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked at Hunter and grinned, even as his face became more youthful and rounded and he grew smaller and smaller. \"Yep! Feels kinda cool, actually!\" His grin widened as he looked back at himself and noticed his clothes had become even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled. \"Well, it is kinda weird, but I gotta say-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Get lost, you little brat!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes flew wide open. What was...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not lost on Hunter, whose amused expression darkened with a bit of concern. \"N-Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, likewise, noticed the shift in his pal's mood, and looked up to address him. \"H-hey, you alright, man?\" His voice had noticeably lightened even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shook his head vigorously. \"N-no, it's nothing,\" he insisted, noticing his own voice had become more youthful as well. \"I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Stay away from that kid; he's bad news...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winced, jerking back a bit. Kiba, noticing this, reached a hand out toward him, making sure to keep a grip on his shorts with his other. \"Naruto, what...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stumbled a bit, almost tripping over his clothes that were now far too large for him, and were growing even larger still. \"Seriously, just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Little freak...graffiti'd all over the front of my shop...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Get lost! Can't you tell when you're not wanted?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If it weren't for the Hokage, you'd be kicked outta this village in no time! Then at least you wouldn't darken anyone else's doorstep again...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the memories continued slamming into his mind, NAruto staggered back, this time tripping over his clothes and falling square on his rump. His heartbeat quickening, he held up his smaller hands in front of him, whimpering a bit as he saw them become smaller and smaller. \"I-I changed my mind!\" Naruto blurted, beginning to breath rapidly as he heard his voice become lighter and his clothes become bigger and bigger. \"I-I don't wanna do this anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, even having shrunk to the point where he was practically tripping over his own clothes, clambered over to Naruto. \"Naruto, what's wrong?\" he asked, his even lighter voice a bit frantic. Akamaru, likewise, whined, darting up to Naruto and looking up at him in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, in the meantime, watched with growing horror. <i>Damn it...how did I not see this coming?!</i> he swore, rushing over to the regressing boys and kneeling by Naruto. <i>The kid had a hellacious childhood, and we talked him into revisiting it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of Hunter's private musings, Naruto stared as his hands became smaller and smaller. \"Stop...please stop...\" he pleaded, noticing offhand that his voice now sounded just slightly deeper than it had when he was a child. Alas, the process had not yet run its course, and his hands continued to shrink. \"Please...please...\" As the last 'please' left his lips, his voice became a bit  choked up, and tears began forming around his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, Kiba, and Akamaru watched helplessly as Naruto continued to shrink, and the tears began to drip down his cheeks, even as the dog-nin's own regression progressed. Within a matter of minutes, both Naruto and Kiba had fully reverted to 8-year-old children, and the little blonde boy was looking at his hands, then at his clothes, which now draped over him like a blanket, in abject horror, his sobs slowly intensifying. \"N-no...no...\" Squinting his eyes shut, he brought his legs (now covered totally by his shorts) up to his chest, wrapping his small arms around them and planting his face in his knees as he began crying harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, for once unsure of what to say, simply crawled up next to Naruto (unable to walk properly in his oversize clothes) and placed a surprisingly gentle hand on his shoulder. Akamaru, likewise, hopped up on Naruto's lap and began licking his face, doing his best to soothe the boy. And Hunter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter winced, hanging his head in abject shame. <i>This is my fault...</i> He clenched his paws. <i>All my fault...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Hunter edged closer to Naruto. Giving the boy a little shake, he flinched as Naruto looked up from his knees at the anthro. \"Naruto, I'm so, so sorr---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it!\" Naruto snapped, shoving Hunter's paw away forcefully. He glared angrily at the wolf. \"Did you really think that if I did this, I wouldn't remember just how lonely and bad it was the first time around?!\" His eyes brimmed with tears. \"Guess I really AM an idiot if I let you talk me into it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked toward his friend, shocked. \"Naruto, calm down! He was just trying to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piss off, dog-breath!\" Naruto screeched, shoving Kiba roughly and knocking the little dog-nin flat on his back. \"You sure as hell didn't help!\" Whining, Akamaru hopped off Naruto's lap and ran over to Kiba, privately relieved that his pal was more shocked than hurt as he sat back upright, staring back at his friend with more than a little guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffling, Naruto swung out at the others. \"J-just go away! L-leave me alone!\" Sobbing, he curled up into his clothes, his little body shaking as sobs and hiccups ravaged it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, eyes widening, reached out toward him, but Hunter gently stayed his arm. \"We should...probably just leave him alone for the moment,\" he said softly told the little dog-nin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's eyes widened. \"But...!\" he protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shook his head. \"Look, I screwed up, and he doesn't wanna talk to any of us right now; it's best if we just let him calm down a bit...\" Kiba, though looking far from happy at the situation, nodded sullenly. Akamaru, crawling up Kiba's clothes and hopping onto his head, whimpered. <i>What are we supposed to do in the meantime, though?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter gave a strained smile. \"I got some more stuff in my bag; why don't we give those a look-see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the anthro-wolf and the regressed dog-nin and nin-dog made their way over to Hunter's bag, the dog-nin still wearing his oversized teen clothes, and began rooting through it. Throughout it all, though, they kept on throwing sad, regretful glances at the little blonde boy curled up on the floor, sobbing and shaking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Where I come from, people use it to write out messages and send them to each other instantly from any distance,\" replied Hunter, occasionally glancing back at the crying little boy in the back.  Still trying to ease the tension, Kiba worked up a smirk and said, \"Huh, that sounds like it could come in pretty handy.  Only thing that'd be even better is if you could use it to talk to people from great distances too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Hunter smirked just briefly at that unintentional critique of modern society.  \"I think that's what cups and wires are for,\" noted Hunter.  \"It even has pictures in it.  Pictures I took from all over the various places I traveled, like...\" groaning to himself, Hunter hung his head a little lower in shame, ears drooping slightly as the sounds of Naruto's sobbing grew louder.  Kiba too, hung his head a little lower, unable to really pretend much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to anyone, Akamaru never took his gaze off the poor boy, and once this moment of regret between the dog-nin and world person had transpired, the little pup slowly trotted over to the boy's side, seeing him still convulsing with each heavy sob, occasionally hiccuping as he tried desperately to silence those awful memories to no avail.  \"Stupid...*Hic*...stupid stupid...\" muttered Naruto to himself.  \"Knew it was a bad idea, but dumbass Kiba just had to keep pushing and pushing...and then that stupid wolf goes and gives us his stupid vial of his stupid formula...and then stupid me has to go and drink it, because I'm just a big stupid bonehead...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young blond then lowered his head into his knees even further, sobbing harder as the awful shouts of hatred from his childhood just kept coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I didn't ask for any of this...</i> he thought to himself, eyes clamped shut as tears streamed down his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the boy flinched slightly as he felt something press against his calf.  Raising his head just slightly, he opened his red, puffy eyes, and looked down to see Akamaru staring right back up at him, front paws still pressed against the boys' thigh, making him stand up as he looked up at Naruto.  \"Please, just go away, Akamaru.  You know I can't understand a word you say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the pup didn't say anything, nor did he move.  He just stared up at the poor boy, then forced himself up higher as he crawled atop his leg and gently hopped onto his arm, as the two just stared face to face in silence.  Deep down, he wanted badly to tell the poor kid that he wasn't alone, that those bad memories were all in the past and that those villagers were just ignorant, scared and selfish, but he knew trying to tell the boy anything would just make him feel more isolated.  Instead, the tiny pup just gave the boy a hearty lick across the face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moment of silence passed.  Just then, Naruto, still sniffling, slowly forced a faint smile as the pup started wagging his tail slightly and licked him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile grew a bit wider, as more tears streamed down his cheeks.  But this time, they were tears of gratitude.  Slowly, he reached a hand over to the pup's head and ruffled his head, causing Akamaru to bark happily as he licked him a third time, this time, eliciting a slight laugh from the boy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Hunter's ears perked up as Kiba too, raised his head and in unison, both turned to the sight.  Taking a deep breath, Hunter turned to Kiba, who nodded, as they both turned back to Naruto and slowly rose to their feet, quietly approaching the boy as he and Akamaru carried on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sat next to his pal, rubbing the back of his head as he cautiously asked, \"Feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's faint smile softened a bit as he nodded slightly, still giving the pup all his attention.  Rubbing the back of his own fuzzy head guiltily, Hunter knelt down to the boy's level, and said, \"Naruto, I...I know it probably doesn't mean anything, but...I really am sorry.\"  Stopping for a moment, Naruto wiped his eyes with his forearm and faintly glanced up at the anthro wolf.  \"I didn't think it was gonna get that bad, I just...after what you said at the steakhouse, I thought maybe; however brief, I could show you that you could experience what you DESERVED to experience the first time around...but it was a dumb idea-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it wasn't,\" Naruto finally spoke up, earning the attention of all three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you were just trying to help, but the truth is, those bad memories will always be there.  Nothing can ever undo that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded solemnly, but understandingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course nothing can be done about it.  The past can't be changed,\" replied Kiba, trying to maintain rationality, \"but the past can't hurt you either.  What happened, happened.  That doesn't mean it'll happen again.  This isn't a second chance at childhood, it's a chance...to just be a kid for a day and enjoy it...WITHOUT the crap from last time.  And you're gonna take that chance and have a blast.  And there's two reasons why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned his attention to the young dog-nin, still sniffling.  Nevertheless, Kiba held up two fingers, \"One; cause you're tough as nails, and you aren't gonna let those stupid jerks from before haunt you like this.  And two?\" Naruto's eyes widened as Kiba gently patted him on the shoulder and smiled warmly at the poor boy.  \"You ain't alone this time.  Me'n Akamaru got your back.  Now, and always...cause that's what friends are for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence passed as Naruto's eyes watered more than before.  Neither Kiba nor Akamaru had abandoned him and left him alone with those bad thoughts of his past.  It was just like the dog-nin said, he wasn't alone.  His friend was still by his side, just like he had been time and time again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a warm, grateful smile rose upon the boys' face as he finally said, \"...Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young dog-nin just smiled back and wrapped his arm around the boy's neck brotherly, earning a soft laugh from the boy, even as Akamaru barked happily and licked the boys' face once more.  Naruto turned to the pup and equally grateful, said, \"Thank you <i>both.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned slightly at the sight.  Then, to his surprise, Naruto glanced back at him.  \"You too.  Everything you've done these past few days for me'n Kiba here, I just want you to know, that means a lot...and I just wanna, say I'm sorry to both of you for freaking out like that...you two didn't do anything wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf gratefully smiled and, still down on the boys' level, gently ruffled his head, both playfully and gratefully.  \"I appreciate that, little guy, really...\" he then sighed and added, \"I just wish this moment wasn't so painful for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping his face, Naruto just shook his head and added, \"It doesn't have to be.  Like Kiba said, my past may never go away, and it might always haunt me, but it's all in the past...it can only hurt me if I let it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Hunter and Kiba smiled at the boy.  \"Now you're talkin',\" Kiba laughed, as both youths turned to Hunter and said, \"Hey, how about we start by getting those new duds?\"  Hunter laughed and nodded as he headed back to the closet, signalling Akamaru to follow as the two youths continued chatting and making amends.  As Hunter dug through the clothes, he looked down at the little pup and smiled, \"That was pretty impressive, little fella.  How'd you managed to get through to the kid?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup wagged his tail, yipping happily.  <i>When someone's in a dark place, they can't be brought back with reason, or words.  Sometimes, the best thing you can do for someone in need...is to just be there for them...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled at the pup and ruffled his head, nodding in understanding.  \"Heh, y'know something?  Those two are pretty lucky to have you watching out for them.\"  Akamaru just licked the wolf's paw and barked happily.  <i>Not as lucky as they are to be such great friends.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Hunter finally grabbed a hold of both new attires for the youths and handed them over.  \"Here you go, boys.  Once we're ready to start this thing over, what would you two like to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, still wiping his face a bit, turned to Kiba, and grinned as he looked back up at the anthro-wolf and replied...</span></div></div>",

I got kinda curious hearing you talk about the different places yuou've visited, anyway...\" He adjutsted the bundle of clothes in his arms a bit. \"First, though, could you maybe give us a second to change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed, ruffling Naruto's head and causing the boy to giggle a bit. \"Go right ahead, boys; besides, I need to get the pictures ready.\" The anthro-wolf chuckled. \"There's a bathtub with a curtain in there, too, so you can both get changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned, hoisting his own bundle of clothes up. \"Thanks, Hunter!\" Sharing a smirk with Naruto, the boys made their way over to the bathroom (almost tripping over their clothes a few times in the process,) Akamaru following close behind. Entering at roughly the same time, the door shut behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head and smiling, Hunter turned his head back to his phone, getting some of the pictures ready. <i>Naruto seems a lot more cheery, now.</i> He sighed. <i>Still, I gotta be careful; I don't want the kid getting upset again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, both Naruto and Kiba emerged from the bathroom, proudly wearing their new duds. As the boys walked toward Hunter, the wolf's ears twitched, and he looked over his shoulder at them. \"Oh hey, boys; lookin' mighty snazzy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Naruto rubbed the back of his head. \"Aww, thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Kiba looked at his shoulder and ruffled Akamaru's fur, the pup nestled snugly in his hood. \"Yeah, and Akamaru likes it too; don't ya, boy?\" The pup happily barked his assent, licking Kiba's cheek and causing the boy to giggle a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was clad in an outfit style he wasn't used to, but had quickly found he'd liked; specifically, a red, short-sleeved button-down shirt and black cargo pants. Kiba, on the other hand, was clad in an outfit that, by some stroke of serendipity, greatly resembled an outfit he'd had when he was a Genin. It was, quite simply, a long-sleeved black hoodie with white lining in the hood, which sat down around his shoulder and within which Akamaru nestled snugly, as well as a wide-cut v-neck, going far enough down his chest to fully expose his necklace-a simple accessory with a metal tag at the end. Two thick, yellow stripes ran from the top of his left shoulder and continued all the way to the bottom of the hoodie. In terms of pants, he wore long, white khaki pants that stopped above the ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled at the sight, wagging his tail. <i>Oh wow; nice job, Midna. Then again, given that she's essentially a queen, it makes sense she'd have good fashion sense...</i> Out loud, Hunter smiled and motioned with his head. \"Alright, boys, I've got the pictures ready; c'mere and give 'em a look-see.\" Eagerly, Naruto and Kiba rushed to his sides, peering over his shoulder at the device he held in his paws. Chuckling at their enthusiasm, Hunter reached up to the screen, fiddling with it a bit before the first picture came up. To their surprise, Hunter winced a bit as he noticed it. \"Ah, great, him...\" Confused, the boys leaned in to get a better view of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture depicted what appeared to be a pale-skinned, thinly-built man in a sleeveless white bodysuit that, oddly enough, had several diamond-shaped cutouts in it. He had short white hair, and lips that were, oddly enough, the same shade.He wore a rather odd-looking cape, and the one ear that wasn't covered by his hair was oddly-pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked in confusion. \"Who's that guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter groaned. \"That...that is the Demon Lord Ghirahim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's eyes widened. \"Demon Lord?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded. \"Yeah; he's kinda creepy, and he has absolutely NO comprehension of the term 'personal space...'\" He chuckled a bit. \"...but damn if he isn't the most fabulous demon lord you've ever met.\" Naruto, Kiba, and Akamaru all shared a befuddled glance at Hunter's choice of words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moving on...\" Hunter muttered, fiddling with the screen again and bringing up another picture. At this, Naruto, Kiba, and Akamaru's eyes all widened. <i>What the hell...</i> Akamaru barked, tilting his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Hunter looked back at his phone; it depicted what appeared to be a rather tall creature that could only be described as a humanoid tree. On his shoulder, what appeared to be a <i>raccoon</i> perched, arms folded and face contortd in what was either a scowl or a cocky smirk. The raccoon was clad in what appeared to be an orange, sleeveless, two-piece bodysuit, though his clawed feet remained unadorned. In addition, he had something slung across his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba raised an eyebrow. \"Is...is that a raccoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked. \"That,\" he began, chuckling, \"is Rocket, and that big guy he's standing on,\" he gestured to the tree-creature, \"is his buddy, Groot.\" He smiled as he examined the picture closer. \"They're a couple of bounty hunters, but once ya get to know 'em, they're not so bad. Groot's really nice...\" <i>Even if all he says is \"I am Groot\",</i> he mused. \"...and Rocket...well, he's got some <i>serious</i> anger and attitude problems, but once ya get past all that, he's a real softy.\" His expression suddenly grew panicked. \"Just, uh, don't tell him I said that, OK? I really don't fancy getting vaporized...or getting my face ripped off...\" In spite of themselves, Naruto and Kiba giggled a bit at his expression. Clearing his throat, Hunter fiddled with the screen again. \"Moving on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next picture he brought up was of a, frankly, rather frightening creature. It was a spindly, purple-scaled, reptilian creature that looked like a cross between a dragon and a pterodactyl, with a long neck, a long tail with a pointed tip, large leathery wings, and cruelly glinting yellow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped. \"Um...who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked equally discomfited. \"That,\" he began slowly, \"would be Ridley, leader of the Space Pirates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ridley?</i> Akamaru whined. <i>What kinda name is that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged. \"Dunno, but the Space Pirates, at least from what I've heard, are a nasty bunch; they go from planet to planet, razing it and stripping it of whatever resources they can find.\" He grimaced. \"They're really into scientific experimentation, too, but they don't much care for proper scientific method...\" <i>Or even if their subjects survive,</i> Hunter thought, his gorge rising slightly at the few things he'd glimpsed when he'd been unlucky enough to end up sneaking around in one of their labs. Composing himself, he continued, \"Ridley, though, he's the worst of them. He's as savage, sadistic and brutal as they come, but he's incredibly intelligent and cunning, not to mention he can talk...\" he shuddered. \"I've only met that maniac once, and even that was too many times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How didja get away?\" Naruto asked, a bit unnerved but still curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged. \"Sheer dumb luck is all I can chalk it up to.\" Shaking his head, he fiddled with the screen again. \"Let's see if we can pull up something more pleasant, shall w---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's head suddenly darted up. \"Did you guys hear something?\" he asked, tugging at his collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Hunter, Kiba, and Akamaru looked toward him. \"N-no, I didn't hear anything,\" Kiba spoke up, raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I got nothin',</i> Akamaru added, tilting his head a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged. \"No, I don't hear anything.\" He looked closely at Naruto. \"Are you still holding up OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\" Naruto exclaimed. \"Yeah, of course I am! Just coulda sworn I heard someone talking...\" He shook his head. \"Probably just hearing things is all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kiba, Akamaru, and Hunter shared an awkward look. However, before one of them could comment on it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grrrroooooowllll....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blushed as his hands flew to his tummy. \"H-heh, sorry about that,\" he laughed, rubbing the back of his head. \"Guess it's been a while since the steakhouse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, smirking, playfully slugged Naruto in the arm. \"Ah, don't sweat it, Uzumaki; I'm actually feelin' a little hungry, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Me three!</i> Akamaru piped up, wagging his tail even as he lay nestled in Kiba's hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me four,\" Hunter chuckled, standing up. Pocketing his phone, he rubbed his stomach eagerly before looking down at the two children. \"How would you boys like some ice cream?\" The boys said nothing, but their faces damn near lit up as huge grins split their faces. Grinning in return, Hunter ruffled both their heads. \"I'll take that as a resounding 'yes'.\" Walking toward the door, he held it open, motioning for the three tof ollow. \"C'mon; I saw an ice cream place on the way here that looked really good.\" Smiling, he headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he walked out of sight, NAruto and Kiba shared competitive grins. \"Last one there's a rotten egg!\" Naruto blurted, darting out the door after Hunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning savagely, Kiba hurried after him, Akamaru still nestled snugly in the hood. \"Guess that's gonna be you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the four made their way out of the inn and onto the streets, Hunter couldn't help but smile and wag his tail as he heard the boys racing, bickering, and laughing behind him. <i>Well, that's a marked improvement,</i> the anthro thought, relieved. <i>Hopefully, they're only gonna continue to improve...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kiba; who fared no better, just grinned and lightlu nudged his pal in the arm.  \"Right back at'cha, Uzumaki.  I didn't you'd actually beat me like that, but damn!\"  Naruto just laughed some more and rubbed the back of his head.  \"What can I say?  When ice cream's on the line-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden loud rumbling caught both theirs and Akamaru's ears.  They all looked up as the rumble grew louder and discovered the source, was actually the wolf's tummy, causing all three to laugh some more while Hunter just chuckled sheepishly and placed a paw against his stomach.  \"Heh, guess I'm a little hungrier than I thought,\" he mused, but nonetheless, smiled at the happy sight of the boys, and at the fact that directly before the four, was the ice cream place.  \"Good timing I guess, cause here we are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter opened the doors, allowing the two youths and pup atop one of the said youths' head to enter as he followed behind and called out to the guy running the counter.  He was initially taken back by the sight of a walking wolf person, but nonetheless, worked up a smile and said, \"Welcome!  You or the little fellas see anything you like?\"  To which, Hunter turned to the boys and asked, \"Whadduya guys feel like havin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two youths glanced at the menu up top for a moment, seeing all sorts of tasty flavors on the board...but then one particular sight caught their eyes.  Sensing what they were about to order, Akamaru whined to himself.  <i>Heeeeere we go again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto reached out and tugged at Hunter's paw as he pointed up at it.  \"Ooo!  Ooo!  Hunter!  I know what we should get!\" he beamed excitedly.  Hunter just laughed and said, \"I'm all ears, kiddo.\"  To which, Naruto grinned and replied, \"Can we four extra jumbo sized sundaes?\"  The man at the counters' eyes widened for a moment, seeing the small size of the boys and pup, but nonetheless shrugged.  \"And what flavors did you guys want those in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Classic chocolate's fine with me,\" said Hunter.  Naruto grinned and said, \"Can I get the Vanilla with extra chocolate syrup and whipped cream?\"  The man nodded as he jotted down the first two orders.  Kiba continued pondering, until he grinned and said, \"Lemme get the mint chocolate chip with extra chocolate syrup and those nut thingies!\"  The man nodded and added it to the list, chuckling at the 'nut thingies' remark.  Despite himself, Akamaru's tail wagged as he saw an item that caught his eyes.  <i>Well, since they have it...can I get strawberry without chocolate syrup, but extra whipped cream and a cherry on top?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kiba reached up and ruffled the pups' fuzzy head as he relayed his order to the man.  \"Alright, fellas.  That'll be about ten minutes to get everything ready, so just go ahead and take a seat anywhere'n we'll get your orders ready.\"  Hunter smiled and paid the man up front before heading towards the tables with his (currently) younger companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four turned and IMMEDIATELY shuddered as the first thing they saw was a booth, calling out to them, almost mocking them....and immediately, the jumped to the nearest table they could find, graced with the freedom of chairs.  The four continued to chat and talk amongst themselves while they waited, until finally, the man wheeled out a cart with all four of their orders waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly, they grabbed them and placed them on their massive sundaes.  Both Hunter and the man watched as the boys struggled with theirs, grunting and huffing to carry them over to their tables.  The sight was enough to make both the anthro and the man just go \"Awwww....\" in unison before turning to each other and chuckling embarrassingly as the man took his leave and Hunter turned his attention back to the boys.  Kiba had managed to get his bowl on the table and hauled the strawberry sundae over besides his own bowl for Akamaru to enjoy as he hopped off his head and trotted eagerly towards his bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four stared eagerly for a moment as their tummies rumbled for the deliciously chilled desserts bestowed upon them...</span></div></div>",

The whipped cream was slathered on, the chocolate sauce running into the ice cream, the nuts dotting as much of the surface as they could, and a huge, juicy cherry on top (in Akamaru's case).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Hunter dug his spoon in, retrieving a big spoonful of ice cream and toppings. \"Heh, sure is...\" Openiing his muzzle, he put the spoon in. His face, subsequently, lit up as he withdrew the empty spoon. \"Oh wow...this stuff's great!\" Wagging his tail, he dug his spoon back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, even as he eagerly dug his spoon in to take a taste, raised an eyebrow. \"Wait a minute; how can you eat chocolate? You're a wolf, aren't you?\" Akamaru, who had eschewed chocolate syrup for that very purpose, barked his agreement. He put his own spoon in his mouth, a huge grin subsequentlhy spreading acrosshis features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled again, taking another spoonful. \"True, but my body functions closely enough to that of a human to let me eat chocolate without any ill effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru growled a bit. <i>Lucky...</i> Shaking his head, he trotted closer to his dish and prepared to take a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, giggling a bit at the exchange (even if he couldn't understand Akamaru), prepared to take a bite...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but stopped with his spoon halfway to his sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, noticing Naruto's hesitation, looked toward the boy. \"Um, Naruto? You feelin' OK?\" the wolf tentatively asked, somewhat worried that the poor boy was experiencing another resurgence of painful memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his and Kiba's relief, Naruto looked up at him and beamed. \"Yeah, I'm doing fine,\" the boy assured. \"I was just thinkin'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scoffed good-naturedly, even as he dug his spoon back in. \"You, thinking? That's a new one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scowled at the other boy. \"Shaddup and listen,\" he retorted, though his smirk betrayed his true mood. \"So I was thinkin', instead of just eating these normally, I was thinking maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating contest?\" Kiba cut in, his eyes lighting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Naruto nodded. \"Eating contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, pulling his head out of his dish, whined. <i>Oh great, not this again..</i> Absentmindedly, he licked his muzzle, getting some of the strawberry ice cream off. <i>Oh wow, it's so sweet and creamy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded, grinning. \"That's actually a good idea; I mean, I dunno about you...\" He gave the boys a mischievous smile. \"...but I feel like I can eat WAY more than twelve scoops of ice cream. The sooner we finish these monsters, the sooner we can get more ice cream!\" He rubbed his stomach, grinning. \"I saw a brownie sundae on the menu that I looked good...buuuuut I won't get that 'till I've finished this.\" He looked back down at Naruto. \"So, what're the terms of the contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked. \"Weeeeelll, I was thinking maybe we try to eat these monsters as fast as we can, and whoever finishes first gets to choose what we get next.\" His smirk became mischievous. \"And whoever comes in last has to pay for these...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What if I come in last?</i> Akamaru piped up, interested in spite of himself. <i>I mean, I don't have any money...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba repeated Akamaru's question to Naruto, who looked rather befuddled. \"Um... I hadn't thought of that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this,\" Hunter piped up, tail wagging. \"If Akamaru comes in last, he has to smell Naruto's feet.\" Naruto's eyes bulged at that, but Kiba and Akamaru looked far from displeased. \"Heh, wouldja lookit that, boy?\" Kiba said, ruffling the dog's head playfully. \"Heck of a motivation, don't ya think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked happily, licking Kiba's hand. <i>Tell me about it. The rest of him smells bad enough...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter snorted at that, a paw flying to his muzzle. Naruto, already a little offended, looked up at him irritably. \"What? What the hell's so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing,\" Hunter assured, stifling his snickers as best he could. \"A-anyway, why don't we get started?\" Naruto, though he still wasn't convinced, nonetheless turned back to his own sundae. Grinning competitively, Kiba and Akamaru did the same. \"Alright, boys, get ready,\" Hunter spoke up, priming his spoon. \"And three, two one...GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the anthro-wolf, the pup, and the two boys dove into their sundaes, shoveling as much in at a time as they could and doing their best, with varying degrees of success, to avoid brain freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto shoveled his vanilla sundae into his waiting maw, something stirred at the edges of his subconscious:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nnngh...hello?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes flew wide open at the voice. <i>There it is again!</i> Naruto thought, shocked. Taking a look at the other three, he saw them continuing to shovel ice cream into their mouths/muzzles; they gave no indication they'd heard the voice. Shaking his head, Naruto continued shoveling ice cream into his mouth, but his brows were set in concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe KNEW he'd heard something, and that it wasn't just his imagination. But what...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Can...can anyone hear me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, even as he continued shoveling ice cream in, narrowed his eyes. <i>That...that sounds like a little kid,</i> he realized. <i>Sounds about as old as me n' Kiba are right now, maybe even a little younger. But who...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>W-wait...why am I in a cage?!</i> The childlike voice suddenly spoke up again, its pitch rising in shock. Grunts of effort sounded in Naruto's head. <i>Nngh...why won't these bars budge?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened slightly. <i>Bars...?</i> he wondered idly, recognition niggling at the edges of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come...come on!</i> the voice grunted, now sounding a bit panicked. <i>Please! I-I don't wanna be stuck in here! It's dark and wet and...and scary!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened a bit more, recognition slowly beginning to dawn on him. <i>Dark and...wet?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>L-lemme out!</i> the voice cried out again, panic now very much evident in its tone. <i>Wh-why am I in prison?! I didn't do anything wrong! Old Man?! Gyuki?! Pl-please! S-somebody h-help...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, comprehension flooded Naruto's mind, much as his awful memories had earlier that day. <i>N-no way!</i> His body went slack, and his spoon fell from his hand and clattered to the floor. Hearing this, Hunter and Akamaru's keen ears twitched, even as they dug into their sundaes. Sitting up and swallowing their current mouthfuls, they directed concerned stares in Naruto's direction. Kiba, noticing this, looked up from his own sundae, his mouth spattered with melted ice cream. Frowning, he wiped his face on his hoodie sleeve and asked, \"Uh, Naruto? You OK?\" Hunter said nothing, but placed a soothing paw on Naruto's back, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto struggled to process the sudden revelation, and thus remained silent for a few more seconds. Then, finally, he closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and replied, \"N-no, it's not.\" He appeared rather shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You flashin' back again, kiddo?\" Hunter asked gently. Maybe bringing him out wasn't such a good idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Naruto shook his head. \"N-no, it's not that. It's just, um...\" His face screwed up as he tried to think of how to phrase what he was about to say. Hunter, Kiba, and Akamaru watched him with bated breath, before Naruto finally opened his eyes and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't think I was the only one affected when I drank that vial.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I...I don't want to be here...!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Naruto's eyes widened as the sound of said 'child's' voice continued to call out to anyone who would listen, anyone who could hear it.  Hunter caught this, wincing a bit nervously, expecting the worst, as he leaned closer to the boy and asked, \"Should we go?\"  But the boy immediately shook his head, but only half paying attention to the anthro.  His eyes were still a bit distant as he listened to the sealed creature continue to wail out, hearing most rustling at some kind of cage.  \"This is...huh...\" Naruto muttered, not remotely sure what he should be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru turned to Kiba and barked curiously.  <i>Well, what's he saying?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised an eyebrow at the pup, but Kiba translated the question and relayed it back to the boy, who scratched his head, a bit surprised to hear himself say what he was about to say, nevertheless, \"...He's...scared.  I don't think he knows where he is or why he's sealed inside of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the young dog-nin and his pup shared a glance, and turned back to Hunter.  <i>I don't understand.  We all drank the vial, and we still had all our memories intact.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded in agreement and added, \"Y-yeah, why wouldn't you-know-who remember why he was sealed away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, legitimately bewildered himself, raised his shoulders and shook his head, unable to think of an answer.  \"I've only ever given this vial to people and creatures in this physical plain of existence, never...well, THAT internal...\"  He then looked away and grimaced.  <i>Well...except maybe that one time I tricked Ghirahim into drinking it so he wouldn't be tall enough to magically appear behind me and flick his tongue all weird the way he does...but he just reverted back into a floating sword...and he still teleported behind me...and STILL managed to flick his sword-tongue out all weird...</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the wolf, both Kiba and Akamaru were still just staring dully at him, tilting their heads curiously as his mind continued to go off on a tangent.  Finally, he shook it off and turned back to them.  \"Sorry, w-what were we-RIGHT...right...you-know-who reverting, right...yeah, I really have nothing.  What's he-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's eyes widened a bit as he saw a bit of a saddened look on Naruto's face.  Both the other boy and pup turned and saw it as well.  \"Hey, what's wrong?\" asked Kiba.  Naruto shook his head a bit assuredly, then piped in.  \"I...really can't believe I'm about to say this, but...I actually kinda...feel bad for him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three, in perfect unison, gaped at the boy in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you KIDDING me?!\" blurted out Kiba.  \"After what he put you through?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned to his friend, face kind of screwing upward like before as he said, \"Yeah, I know, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, he began to hear that childlike voice sob softly to itself, weakly batting at the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...If he really doesn't know what's going on, then...at least for the time being, he's being isolated and punished for something, and he doesn't even know why,\" replied Naruto as he looked down, a bit more distantly and added, \"...I know the feeling.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and HE'S the reason you know that feeling!\" snapped Kiba, a bit angrily.  Hunter raised his paw, trying to cool things down a bit, concerned that it would blow up again like before.  But to his surprise, Naruto didn't reply in anger, rather, he nodded softly, simply saying, \"I know.  But he doesn't.  At least...not like this, he doesn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to admit, it was a very surreal feeling.  Living with the Kyuubi sealed away inside of his body had made his childhood a proverbial hell on earth.  There was a tremendous amount of resentment held against Kurama for that, but the two had gradually grown to 'tolerate' one another as time went on.  But right now, there was just a scared young Kyuubi sealed away, alone, and completely isolated from his companions and the sage he greatly admired and respected, and frankly...it was kind of heartbreaking for the boy.  As if a bit crude, his tummy rumbled a bit, as if to remind him, 'Sundaes first, sealed Kyuubi's later,' but obviously, Naruto being Naruto, he stilled those thoughts, and continued to ponder on how to properly 'deal' with this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he took a deep breath, and decided to...</span></div></div>",

He's lived with you literally your entire damn life, and he would know EXACTLY what you would do in a situation like this!\" Hunter recoiled a bit at the outburst, but managed to calm himself. After all, he was only worried for his friend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought for a moment. That was definitely a possibility; the fox had made no secret of his desire to break free and wreak havoc in the past...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>O-old Man? G-Gyuki? Matatabi? Anybody? Please, I don't like it in here!</i> The boy heard more rustling against the cage. <i>Please! I'm scared...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's expression softened as he heard the 'child's' tearful entreaties. \"I...I don't think he is,\" Naruto finally spoke up, looking directly at Kiba. \"He...he really sounds like he doesn't know what's going on.\" Naruto looked downwards. \"I...I guess I can kinda relate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scowled, evidently still not happy with Naruto's decision, but he nonetheless lowered himself back into his seat, folding his arms. \"Well, yeah, but we still don't know what the hell's going on; talking to him, even when he's like this, could be really dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, and it's not like you'll be able to become Hokage if you end up as fox kibble,</i> Akamaru protested. Wisely, neither Kiba nor Hunter elected to translate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-look, Naruto,\" Hunter finally spoke up. \"It's really nice what you wanna try to do, but I kinda gotta go with Kiba on this one; we don't know what you're getting yourself into...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hic...someone...please...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes hardened. \"Sorry, guys, but I can't let him go through this, at least without knowing what's going on.\" He clenched his fists noticeably, and gave Hunter, Kiba, and Akjamaru his most determined glare. Kiba returned it, but Hunter simply closed his eyes, pinched the bridge of his muzzle, and sighed deeply. A few seconds passed like this, with neither boy willing to give an inch. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys, come on,\" Hunter spoke up, opening his eyes and pushing his seat out. \"We're going back to the inn.\" Kiba gaped at him in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...you're actually going ALONG with this?!\" the young dog-nin protested, even as Hunter rose to his paws. \"Are you crazy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged, unable to help the side of his muzzle quirking up ever so slightly. \"I've been told that, yes, but it's evident Naruto's not gonna budge on this.\" He gave an understanding look to the blonde boy as he hopped down out of his chair. \"Besides, I think I have an idea as to how we can minimize any risk to Naruto.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba glared at the anthro for a few seconds before, finally, huffing and looking away. \"Fine, but I still don't like it.\" Grumbling, he scooped Akamaru up, placed him in his hood (still on his shoulder), and hopped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Hunter put the payment for the four sundaes on the table (after all, even if they'd barely touched them, they'd still bought them), and motioned for the boys to follow. Together, they left the parlor, their ice cream sundaes lying forgotten on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, everyone set?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time returning to the inn, Kiba, Akamaru, and Hunter sat in a circle around Naruto. The two canines and boy had small, metallic nodes attached to their heads, each of which had a small cord on it that attached to a small node on Naruto's forehead. The blonde was sitting with his legs folded under him, his eyes closed in deep concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Naruto replied, not opening his eyes. He frowned. \"You guys don't have to do this, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scoffed. \"What, you think we're just gonna let you go in there alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked, licking Naruto's hand. <i>Either you're going in there with us, or you're not going at all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWagging his tail at Akamaru's comment, Hunter nodded, tugging his cord lightly to test its strength. \"Yep, and besides, if things go south, one of us can disconnect and bring the rest with us.\" He gave Naruto an encouraging smile. \"It should be safe.\" <i>At least, it had BETTER be safe...Rocket, if you gave me a piece of junk just to screw with me, I swear I'll...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a breath and composed himself; now wasn't the time. \"Alright, kiddo,\" Hunter said to Naruto. \"Just do what you usually do whenever you go to talk to the Kyuubi, and this little gizmo,\" he tugged on it again for emphasis, \"will drag us along for the ride.\" He looked around. \"Everybody ready?\" Kiba and Akamaru nodded, both looking rather determined. Smiling a bit, Hunter looked back toward Naruto. \"Go for it, kiddo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of himself, a bit of sweat dripped down Naruto's forehead. \"Al-alright...\" Taking a deep breath, he relaxed his hands, and concentrated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking around, he noted that he was within his 'mindscape', the Kyuubi's prison. \"G-guys?\" Naruto spoke up, shuddering a bit at the way his voice echoed. \"You here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're here,\" Kiba's voice spoke up. Turning his head in the direction of the voice, Naruto saw the little dog-nin resting on his hands, Akamaru still in his hood. Naruto sighed in relief, smiling...  until something occurred to him. \"Wait, where's Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here!\" Hunter's voice gasped. A bit alarmed, Naruto and Kiba looked toward the sound of his voice...and, in spite of the situation, giggled as they saw the wolf on his front, hoisitng himself up on his front paws as his fur, noticeably drenched, dripped. \"You...heh...OK?\" Kiba snorted, holding his hand over his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Hunter shook himself, sending water spraying everywhere. \"Yeah, I'm fine,\" he grunted. Climbing to his hind paws, he looked around. \"So...this is where he's kept...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kinda dark,\" Kiba admitted, getting up. He sniffed. \"It smells weird in here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rolled his eyes a bit, getting to his own feet. \"Well, sorry it doesn't smell like roses...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, they fell silent for a few seconds as they looked around, taking stock of their surroundings. They appeared to be in a long, dingy-looking hallway of some sort. Toward the end of it, which wasn't all that far away, were a set of red bars. From within, they could glimpse something shifting a bit, and they could have even sworn they'd heard sniffling and the occasional muffled sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That him?\" Hunter asked, getting a little nervous. Naruto merely nodded. \"Thought so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bead of sweat dripping down his face, Kiba nonetheless smirked and put a hand on Naruto's shoulder. \"Well, considering you're so damned determined to do this...\" he grinned. \"...you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took a deep breath to calm himself. \"Y-yeah, I guess...\" he looked at his companions. \"You guys?\" Akamaru barked, and Hunter smiled and gave a paws-up. \"Alrighty, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, they slowly made their way up to the bars, the sniffles and sobs becoming ever louder. As they got closer, they could see that whatever was behind them was rather orange and furry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser they drew to the bars, and louder the cries became, until, finally, they were standing directly in front of them...and they could see what lay behind them. Kiba, Hunter, and Akamaru simply stared at the sight, unsure of what to think. Naruto, however, gaped, struck by the change that had come over his 'passenger'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had faced the Kyuubi before, the fox had been positively <i>massive</i>, easily standing as tall as a building. His pose had always been self-assured and confident, almost arrogantly so, and his slitted eyes had glinted with hatred, malice, and a promise to hurt everything that Naruto had ever cared about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being he saw in front of him was none of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, what he saw before him was a rather large fox kit, his proportions softer, and younger than Naruto had ever seen him. easily towering over an adult human, but was still nowhere near as huge as he had been as an adult. His tails, which had always flowed and swished about, were noticeably shorter, fanning out in back of him, and his arms, which had been thin but well-muscled, were now noticeably thicker and shorter. These arms supported the young Kyuubi as he sat perpendicular to the bars, his eyes shut as tears dripped from them, his sniffles and sobs now audible for all to hear. \"*Hic*...someone, please...\" he pleaded. The other three's eyes widened; he sounded no older than Naruto or Kiba at the moment, maybe even a few years younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Akamaru shared a glance, unsure of what to make of the display; if he was faking, he was doing a damn good job of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, for his part, managed to remind himself why they were there. HE clenched his fists, took a deep breath, and said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike lightning, the fox kit's eyes shot wide open, and they locked right on the boy. All four recoiled a bit, until they realized it was not hatred with which he was looking at them, but shock...and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAH!\" The young creature cried, falling onto his rump and scooting back. \"Wh-who are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could reply, Kiba blurted, \"Why don't you tell us who you are first?\" Hunter and Akamaru gave him a shocked look, but said nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child's still-puffy eyes widened. \"M-me?\" Gulping, he looked around his cage fearfully before focusing back on Kiba. \"K-Kurama...my-my name's Kurama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kurama...?</i> All four wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sniffed again. \"Wh-who are you?\" He looked at his bars, chewing his lip a bit. \"A-and why am I in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, gulping, debated what to do.

In his current state, part of Naruto wanted nothing more than to scream at Kurama, to curse his very existence as loudly as he possibly could.  But as he finally looked up once more, he saw the tear soaked eyes of the young Kyuubi...visibly trembling with fear.  Then, his gaze softened, and he remembered why he was here with the others in the first place.  Because this frightened creature; at least in this very moment, hadn't become the said hate-filled monster sealed away within the boys' body and causing every living creature around him to fear and detest him.  This was just a 'little' fox kit.  Alone, confused, and terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wasn't about to lash out at this creature for something that wasn't his fault.  Blinking away a few tears that had welled up from the heat of the moment, the boy forced a smile, and said, \"...I'm Naruto.  Nice to meet you...\" he then turned to the others and added, \"This here is my good pal Kiba.  The little fella on his head is Akamaru, and the wolf person here is Hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Hunter and Kiba worked smiles, still noticeably nervous and waved ever so slightly at the Kyuubi.  \"P-pleased to meet'cha...\" said Hunter.  Seeing the creature still shivering a bit with fear, Naruto held his hands out assuredly and said, \"Don't worry, we aren't going to hurt you, Kurama.  You have nothing to be afraid of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung Kurama whimpered to himself and nervously asked in between sobs, \"D-do you know w-w-why I'm here...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys' strained smile faded as a look of some notable sadness grew over his face.  Naruto's entire reason for coming here was to help young Kurama understand what was going on, but then, another thought occurred.  He was going to be like this for a majority of the day, and however long Naruto would be regressed, so would Kurama.  For that entire time, the frightened young kit would have to carry the weight of knowing what his older self had done, and what he would grow up into.  In all likelihood, Kurama would remember everything once the formula wore off, but until that moment came, he'd still be 'innocent'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Naruto glanced back at the creature and said, \"Can you tell me what the last thing you remember was?\"  The young kit shifted nervously as he looked around his cage apprehensively, still sobbing slightly.  \"I...I was with the others, and the old man.  He...he told us he was...\" again, the young Kyuubi's eyes welled with more tears as he shut his eyes, causing the tears to trickle down his furry face, and added, \"...was going to be...l-leaving us soon...but that we'd all be together, even if we were far apart...and that we'd all guided down the...the right path...but the rest...n-no, I can't remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sobbing grew louder as more tears trickled down his orange furred cheeks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I miss him...I miss all of them...I...I want to go home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined with sympathy for the creature.  Even Hunter and Kiba couldn't help but feel sympathy for the poor creature, neither one believing he was playing a game this time.   Naruto sighed to himself, knowing that wasn't going to happen.  But just then, anotehr thought entered the conflicted young boys' mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The...'old man' told you that you'd be sealed within another being and guided down the right path?\" he asked.  The kit; eyes still clamped shut, simply nodded, still crying to himself.  Then, a smile rose over Naruto's face, as he added, \"Well...t-that's why you're here, Kurama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Kyuubi's eyes slowly opened as they focused back on Naruto, hesitantly as he nervously asked, \"...W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sealed within my body, because...because I'm going to help you set on the right path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio behind Naruto simply glanced at the boy, unsure what to make of what he was telling the kit, but none dared to so much as utter a word.  And so, Naruto continued...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm gonna help you...grow stronger, wiser, and then...someday....we're gonna accomplish really great things together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we are...?\" asked Kurama, weakly.  Naruto just nodded confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after a moment, the creature still whimpered sadly as he said, \"...B-but...I...I'm all alone over here...\"  At this, Naruto simply shook his head and replied, \"No, you're not.  You've got me.  This is within my body.  If ever you're feeling lonely, just...lemme know and I'll drop by and keep you company.\"  Kurama's face softened slightly as he leaned down towards the front of his massive, red cage, and laid his head down just in reach of Naruto to meet the boys' level, and, almost hopefully, he asked, \"....Y-you promise...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed, then, to the shock and concern of the others, Naruto stepped closer and closer to the cage, and; despite his bettr judgement, reached past the cage and placed his hand gently against the still large face of the young kit, both of whom flinched at the action initially, but once his palm made contact with the furry kit, Naruto simply smiled warmly at him.  \"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter inched further and further back, just half a second away from yanking the cords and pulling everyone out, in fear that the young fox was about to make 'fox kibble' as Akamaru put it, out of Naruto.  But that never happened.  To his, Kiba, and Akamaru's surprise, the young Kyuubi...smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy just smiled back and playfully pat the kits' face before stepping back.  \"Feeling any better?\" asked the boy.  The kit rose up just slightly, and nodded back at the boy.  \"Good.  Now, my friends and I have to go, but don't worry, I'll visit you again, sometime.  You have my word.\"  With that, the boy stepped away and headed back towards the two canines and the young dog-nin, as they walked onward, until out of sight from the young kit, who sat back down and finally, gratefully said, \"...Thank you...Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce clear from Kurama's cage and his radius altogether, Kiba finally turned to his friend and asked, \"I thought you were gonna tell him what was going on....why he was REALLY sealed away like that.\"  Naruto raised his shoulder, and then replied, \"I was...but, I couldn't do that to him.  That Kyuubi hasn't become the one that screwed up my life.  I didn't want him to hurt and feel bad for something he hadn't even done yet.  Then, I'd be no better than those villagers who did the same thing to me as a kid...and that wouldn't be fair to him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Hunter smiled warmly at the young boy and knelt down, patting Naruto's shoulder.  \"You know something?  You're a really good kid, Naruto,\" the anthro said, causing the boy to smile back, laughing a bit as Kiba pat him on the other shoulder.  \"He's right, pal.  That was actually, really swell of ya!\"  The pup yipped in agreement, kicking the boys' hand before hopping back up atop Kiba's hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya think Kurama will remember any of this when he reverts back to his usual self?\" asked Kiba.  But Naruto just shrugged once more.  \"Maybe he will, maybe he won't.  Doesn't matter.  Long as <i>this</i> Kurama isn't hurting or scared the way he was, that's all that matters to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after some doing, Hunter managed to yank the cord and in unison, all four were sucked out of this strange realm, and back to reality, all a bit dazed and weary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RUUUUUUUUUUMMMMBLLLEEEE!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And with a loud rumbling from all four of their tummies in one audible moment, QUITE famished.  So, they decide to...</span></div></div>",

This was not lost on Kiba, who realized that Naruto's hand-clench had very little to do with his own hunger pains. He opened his mouth to say something, but Hunter interrupted before he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, I'd be all for it, but like I said, that trip took a lot outta us.\" The wolf blinked slowly, looking somewhat dazed. \"Maybe we should stay here and gather our wits first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, c'mon!\" Kiba protested. \"I'm starving! Besides, we're not THAT outta sorts!\" The boy hopped to his feet to demonstrate, but he quickly lost his footing. \"Wh-wha---\" waving his arms in a circle he tried to keep his balance, but succeeded only in falling flat on his rump. He winced and rubbed the seat of his pants as Akamaru ran up to him, making sure that he was alright. \"O-OK, MAYBE I'm still a little dizzy, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-actually, I think that might be a good idea,\" Naruto spoke up, sounding oddly relieved. \"We-we don't wanna get ourselves in trouble...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of himself, Hunter chuckled. \"Yeah, we might end up in an even worse situation than that thing with the booth!\" Immediately, all four shuddered at the incredibly embarrassing memory, but quickly shook it off. \"Besides, I have a few snacks we can munch on to help take the edge off, 'least till we're ready to go again.\" As if to punctuate this, his stomach rumbled again, this time rather audibly. \"Heh...guess that's my cue.\" Carefully getting to his paws and wobbling a bit, he nonetheless made his way back over to his duffel, where he began rooting around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wolf searched through his bag, Kiba looked toward Naruto. \"What're you so happy about? Even with snacks, we'll probably still be hungry until we can walk around again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winced as his own tummy audibly reminded him that it needed food, but he nonetheless managed to look back at Kiba. \"What're you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba rolled his eyes. \"I'm TALKING about the fact that you actually looked happy when Hunter said we couldn't go out just yet! Why are you...\" the boy slowed to a stop as Naruto's hand again clenched his stomach, and he inwardly kicked himself for failing to see it. \"It's about Kurama, ain't it?\" At Naruto's slow nod, Kiba gave his friend his best reassuring smirk. \"What're ya so worried about? Ya talked to him, cheered him up a little...why are ya still lookin' so down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shrugged. \"I-I dunno. I guess...\" he sighed deeply. \"...I guess I just feel bad for him, locked away in that cage, all wet and dark...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's ears twitched as he rooted through his bag, and he felt a pang of sympathy for the young Kyuubi, even as he resorted to using his nose to dig something up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba frowned. \"Yeah, well...it's not like we can do much for him there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned in return, but he knew exactly what Kiba meant; if he undid the seal and let Kurama out, things would probably be fine at first, but once he reverted back to his proper age....the blonde shuddered, not wanting to think about it. \"Y-yeah, and it's not like we can just pull him out either, 'cause, you know...\" Kiba, grimacing, nodded. He'd never seen it personally, but he'd heard about what happened to Jinchuriki who'd had their Tailed Beasts removed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined, looking up at Kiba. <i>Yyyeah, I think we wanna avoid that...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, even as he withdrew a few bags of chips from his bag, shook his head. It really was a sucky situation; a (currently) young, innocent creature, locked in surroundings that were, frankly, dank and depressing...it was a raw deal for anybody. <i>Damn it, if only I had something in my bag that could help...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, his bag contained a great number of things: clothes and common amenities, certainly, but also items of great power, sentient relics that should have never seen the light of day, technologies from far-off galaxies that could work all manner of wonders, up to and including ripping the fabric of space-time...but nothing that could let Kurama roam free, nor anything that could extract him without Naruto giving up his life in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But it's not fair!</i> Hunter thought angrily, zipping up his bag. <i>The kid's lonely, he's away from those he cares about...he should at least have the chance to play like any kid has a right to!</i> His face clouded a bit, he nonetheless got up and made his way over to the two boys. Sitting down, he almost shoved two bags toward the boys. Taken a bit off-guard by Hunter's unusually stormy expression, they nonetheless accepted the proffered snacks. In a matter of moments, their bags of chips were open, and they were dipping their hands (and paws) in, munching on the salty snacks, with Kiba giving Akamaru a few. All the while, though, they thought of Kurama's unfortunate situation, and wondered what, if anything they could do to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they neared the end of their bags...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The boys and canines continued munching on their salty snacks, minds more than occupied by the poor fox kit sealed away in the blonde.  More and more, their bags depleted, and while not enough to sate their hunger even remotely, it at least served to silence their groaning tummies, if at least temporarily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, boy did I need that,\" Kiba exclaimed, patting his tummy happily.  Naruto wiped his mouth of some crumbs and nodded back, still fairly perplexed.  Akamaru looked up at the boy and whined.  <i>I've never seen Naruto this deep in thought...in fact, I'm still getting used to the idea that he's capable of thinking at all...</i>  Kiba couldn't help but chuckle somewhat half heartedly, still admittedly feeling some sympathy for the Kyuubi as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter had finished his chips in no time at all, and was now licking his chops clean almost forcefully, as though it did absolutely nothing for him, except maybe silence his rumbling stomach for the time being.  Propping himself on the floor, he folded his hind paws together, tapping on his temple with his hand-paws, also in deep thought.  Both Kiba and Akamaru caught this, then turned to see a similar position and expression from Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There has to be SOMETHING...</i> the wolf thought to himself.  Again, he rummaged through his bag, trying to think of something that would work.  He had plenty of strange gadgets and relics to be sure, but not a single one of them was enough to do the trick.  But then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaaaaait a second...\" Hunter muttered to himself, face lighting up as he dug a little deeper and a bit more frantically, earning the attention of the two boys and tiny pup.  Some more rummaging continued, then, to everyone's surprise, he pulled out a bizarre looking stone owl with its' wings closed.  <i>Thank. You.  Mid-NA!</i> he mused internally.  Then, a smile quickly formed over his muzzle as he dug around some more.  The boys were still gaping at the odd looking statue.  \"Ummm, Hunter...w-what is that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill digging around, Hunter only half paid attention as he muttered, \"A possible answer,\" and continued rummaging about.  \"Aha!\" he yipped happily as he reached in and pulled out another statue, identical to the last one and placed it next to the other.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, all I need is....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter dug and dug, while the others watched.  Akamaru tilted his head curiously at the sight.  <i>Jeez, there is a LOT more stuff inside that bag than I realized...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Hunter stopped rummaging, and; laughing victoriously, quickly pulled himself out, carrying something delicately up in the air with both front paws.  If the others didn't know better, they could have SWORN they heard an odd 'discovery' melody playing as Hunter held it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Kiba, scratching his head curiously.  Slowly bringing his paws down, Hunter revealed an unusual blue instrument.  It looked like a rounded flute, with a few distinct holes on the front.  \"This; boys, is the 'Ocarina of Time', and those statues, are Kaepora Gaebora statues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio just stared dully, not sure what any of that meant.  Hunter chuckled a bit to himself and said, \"Lemme explain.  This here,\" he held up the Ocarina for emphasis, \"is a musical instrument that unleashes magic with every unique melody you play into it.  But there's one song in particular that's proven fairly useful in tight jams.  The 'Song of Soaring'.  Basically, you play it, and you will magically teleport wherever these statues reside, so long as you've activated them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do that?\" asked Naruto, still wrapping his already bewildered mind around the idea.  Hunter just grinned and placed one statue at the center of the inn.  Then, Hunter reached into his bag once again and grabbed a bizarre looking stick.  \"May not be the Sword of Time, buuuuut...\" and with all his might, he whacked the statue on the head as hard as he could, startling the other three youths.  In an instant, it began to glow, and in a flash of white light, that same statues closed wings opened nice and wide.  \"And there you have it.  Now, if I play the song, me and everyone within proximity of the Ocarina will be teleported right back to this spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes lit up as he quickly began to piece it all together.  But then, another thought entered his mind.  \"Well, wait, wouldn't that just be a one way trip?\"  Hunter grinned and pointed towards the second unactivated statue.  \"Only if it's the only one activated.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter then turned to the boys a bit more focused.  \"Here's what I'm thinking.  We all feel bad for the kit and wanna do something for him, right?\"  The others nodded a bit somberly, then Kiba added, \"But we also know if we break the seal, and he eventually reverts back to his normal form...that we're...in trouble.\"  Hunter nodded, fully aware, then added, \"Well, what if we didn't break the seal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others glanced curiously at him as he turned his attention back to the statues and the Ocarina.  \"If we found a way to get this statue inside Kurama's cage, and activated it there, we could play the song, and all teleport in between his cage and the statue at the inn.  That way, we slip between subconscious to the physical, and the seal remains perfectly intact!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you really think that'll work?\" asked Naruto, a bit hopefully.  Hunter shrugged, and said, \"I really don't know, but...that's as close to a shred of an idea as I can really come up with.\"  Internally, Hunter almost shuddered in annoyance, half expecting Rocket to demand to know how much of a percent of an idea a shred was, but quickly shook it off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whadduya guys say?  Should we give it a shot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then looked back at the others, no one looked entirely convinced, but no one looked completely against the idea either.  \"It's up to you, Uzumaki.  If you think it's worth a shot, then so do I,\" said Kiba, nudging the boy encouragingly.  Akamaru barked happily, tail wagging; obviously in agreement to his companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Naruto on the other hand, was still in mid-turmoil.  He wanted very much to help this current Kurama out, because even after that talk, he knew it was going to be rough, all alone for however long he and Naruto were going to be young.  At the same time, however, having Kurama in the physical world...that was a tall order.  Deep down, he knew the kit wasn't that same monster he knew (yet), but to have such a powerful creature back in the physical world like that...was tricky, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Naruto nodded to himself, then turned back to Hunter...</span></div></div>",

Naruto scowled a bit at the insult, but then he smiled as it registered for the playful jibe it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, smiling a bit, nodded. \"Alright, then.

To their annoyance, he looked away. \"Yeah, that could work...\" he muttered to himself, tail wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT could work?\" Naruto demanded. \"C'mon, now's not the time to hold out on us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Glancing toward the boys, Hunter winced and rubbed the back of his head. \"Eh, sorry about that, boys; I get a little carried away sometimes. But never mind that!\" Walking toward the boys, he bent down, statue still in hand. \"Here, hold this for a second, willya?\"  He held it out to the boys. \"I'm gonna get that little gizmo from earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked, even as he reached out to take it. \"Sure, but didn't you just say that wouldn't work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter winked. \"I did, but that was before I thought of my idea.\" Once he was sure Kiba had a good grip on it, he loosened his paws. \"Be careful with that, though; it's sorta fragile.\" He stood up, releasing his grip completely as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smiled. \"Heh, suAAAAAAH!\" Eyes flying open, he scrambled to get a better grip on the statue as it dragged his arms downwards. As it was, he was barely able to hold the statue a couple inches off the floor. \"Th-this thing weighs a freaking ton!\" Sweating a bit, he glared at the wolf, even as he rooted through his bag to try and find the device again. \"How were you able to lift this damn thing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged. \"'Cause I'm not fun-size right now, that's why.\" A grin spread across his muzzle as his paws closed over the device; nodding, he pulled it out, walked over to the boys and pup, and once again got them all hooked up to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now what?\" Naruto asked. \"You said you had an idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-whatever it is,\" Kiba grunted, trying to keep the statue from falling, his little arms straining, \"just tell us already! I don't think I can hold onto this for much longer!\" Akamaru, whining from within Kiba's hood, licked the boy's cheek, trying to provide some comfort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling nervously, Hunter bent down to the boys'  level. \"Well...it kinda involves you still holding the statue...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you KIDDING me?!\" Kiba barked, scowling and wincing as he tried ever harder to keep the statue aloft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter held a paw up. \"Lemme finish,\" he cut in patiently. \"It involves you, and all three of us, holding onto this statue tight as possible. That way, it might get transported with us, same way our clothes are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru tilted his head. <i>But...our bodies are still gonna be in the real world. How is something physical gonna...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled and ruffled the dog's head. \"Sometimes, Akamaru, ya can't sweat the small stuff.\" Before the dog could protest Hunter reached a paw out and tightly gripped the statue (and causing Kiba to sigh in relief as the weight abated a bit.) Gripping the Ocarina in the other paw, he turned to the other two and said, \"Alright; Naruto, Akamaru, your turn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a bit confused,Akamaru hopped out of Kiba's hood and onto the floor, where he proceeded to trot up to the statue and, with some doing, stand on his hind legs long enough for him to rest his front paws on the magical statue. Naruto, a bit puzzled by the odd sight, nonetheless reached both hands out to the statue, wrapping them around it as much as he could. \"Everyone got the statue?\" Hunter asked. The other three nodded or barked in confirmation. \"Great!\" He smiled reassuringly at the blonde. \"Naruto, if you please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, and not quite able to hide his smile, Naruto closed his eyes and concentrated....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama sniffed bit, folding his front legs/arms and lying his head down upon them. It wasn't the most comfortable, but it beat laying in the water...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I knew Naruto said I wasn't alone, but...</i> he sniffed again, a tear running down his cheek. <i>...I still feel alone in here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore tears accumulated in his eyes as he thought of the Old Man, and of his companions. He felt an ache in his chest; he missed them all more than words could say. Matatabi, Isobu, Son, Kokuo, Saiken, Choumei, Gyuki...heck, he even missed <i>Shukaku</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>}I wonder if Naruto would be willing to talk...</i> the young Tailed Beast wondered. After all, the boy HAD said to let him know if he was ever feeling lonely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit shook his head closing his eyes. <i>N-no; he was just here, and he'd probably get annoyed if I called him back so soon...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya, Kurama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the youthful voice, Kurama's eyes flew wide open, and joy exploded in his chest as he saw Naruto smiling and waving at him through his cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto!\" Kurama exclaimed, muzzle lighting up with a huge smile. In a flash, he got to his paws and ran up to the cage. \"You're back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Naruto rubbed the back of his head. \"Hey, I said I'd be back, didn't I?\" He reached through the cage and patted Kurama on his face, eliciting a giggle from the young Kyuubi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, dunno why you're so surprised; bonehead always keeps his promises...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widening, Kurama looked behind Naruto to see the people who had come with him before. The other boy-Kiba, he thought it was-was smirking at him, hands in his pockets; he must have been the one who had spoken. The puppy in his hood-Akamaru?-barked a greeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kurama asked, sitting up straighter. \"Why are you guys here too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weird wolf that wore clothes and walked like a person-Hunter, wasn't it?-grinned, stepping aside to reveal some sort of weird statue that looked like an owl on the ground. \"Oh, us?\" He directed his grin at the blonde. \"Why don't you tell him, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blinked, tilting his head. <i>Tell me?</i> he thought anxiously. That anxiety promptly vanished when he saw Naruto's face light up, and his mouth stretch out in a grin. If it had been something bad, he probably wouldn't have been smiling like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeelll,\" Naruto began, folding his arms behind his head and rocking on his feet a bit, \"they're here to help me get ya outta here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are?!\" the kit exclaimed, his own face lighting up; in his excitement, he rushed even further toward the cage, practically pressing his face against it (and startling Naruto enough that he feel clean on his rump.) \"I don't hafta be stuck in here anymore?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto giggled, getting back to his feet. \"Nope!\" he replied happily. \"See, Hunter here has a couple of Kippura Gabbora...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaepora Gaebora,\" Hunter piped up, unable to stifle a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Kaepora Gaebora statues,\" Naruto continued, throwing an annoyed glance in Hunter's direction, \"and, well, the way it works is, if ya got two of 'em activated at separate locations, Hunter can play something on that weird instrument of his,\" Hunter raised up an odd, flute-like instrument, waving it about, \"and it'll transport ya to wherever the other one is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded, grinning. \"We already have one activated in the real world,\" the young dog-nin began. \"All we gotta do is activate the one here, play that tune, and we should all end up back in the real world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf at all possible, young Kurama's happy grin grew even wider. \"Really? Just like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled. \"Just like that.\" Picking the statue up, he carried it forward, setting it down just behind Kurama's cage. Procuring an odd-looking stick seemingly out of nowhere (hey, it was a subconscious mind; the laws of physics didn't exactly apply...), he raised it over his head and brought it down with a resounding WHACK. Just like before, the statue let out a flash of light, spreading its wings as it did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf nodded, pleased with his work. \"Alrighty, then; everyone gather around Kaepora, and I'll play the Song of Soaring!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey needed no second bidding: Kiba and Akamaru rushed up to the statue, as did Naruto (who had a rather shorter distance to go). Kurama, likewise, got close to the statue, body practically vibrating with excitement. Laughing, Hunter walked up, lifted the Ocarina to his muzzle, and began to play. It was a simple, short melody, consisting of three notes in ascending order repeated multiple times. As he reached the end of it though, something occurred to the (currently) tiniest member of the group...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait a minute,</i> Akamaru whined. <i>Is he really gonna fit in the room?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the eyes of all those present (save Naruto) flew wide open as they processed his statement...just as Hunter hit the last note. \"Wait, wha--\" Kiba started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never got the chance to finish as, without warning, a huge pair of white wings sprung up around them, enveloped them, and filled the room with light...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light faded, Naruto's subconscious was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back at the in, the area where the four had gathered around the statue, all hooked up to Hunter\u2019s gizmo, had now become shrouded in bright white light, as suddenly, the great white wings that had enveloped the scene from within Naruto\u2019s subconscious enveloped the scene once more.  They spiraled, making a rapid circular shape as they span faster and faster, until, with a great fluttering of white feathers, it was gone.  In its\u2019 place, stood the four, in the same position as they were before they had left, eyes still squeezed shut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, they fluttered open.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, Akamaru and Hunter, all with nervous looks on their face, as they assessed the damage a young but still oversized Kyuubi would have caused to the inn, expecting the worst.  But, to their surprise, the room was\u2026untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, oblivious to their concerns, glanced around for a different reason.  \u201cH-hey, where\u2019s Kurama?\u201d he asked, catching the attention of the others.  For the briefest moment, they feared their plan had failed, and that the poor creature was still trapped in his cage within Naruto\u2019s subconscious.  But their fears were quickly sated when a familiar youthful voice piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you guys are a lot bigger up close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, all four turned around, and nearly gaped in astonishment.  Behind them was the young fox kit sitting calmly and firmly; his tails gently wafting behind him, to be sure, only\u2026they found they were no longer looking up just to see the creature.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, the trek from subconscious to the physical had brought young Kurama into the physical world, just as Hunter planned.  Unexpectedly,  however, the young kit seemed to have shrunken a considerable amount.  He hadn\u2019t regressed to a younger state than he already was, but now, he had shrunken down to about a little smaller than both Naruto and Kiba\u2019s size; a size in which Naruto was NOT used to seeing the Kyuubi.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill gaping, Naruto, Kiba and Akamaru immediately darted their gaze back to Hunter, who just scratched the back of his head and said, \u201cWell, c\u2019mon\u2026there were bound to be SOME side effects to transporting spiritual beings to the physical.  Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019ll revert back to his proper size when he\u2019s back.  Maybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit nervous, Naruto scratched the back of his own head and asked, \u201cSooooo, Kurama\u2026.how do ya feel?\u201d  To his; and everyone else\u2019s relief, the kit smiled gleefully as he exclaimed, \u201cI feel great!  This place is WAY nicer than that other place!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked in amusement and some relief at the sight of the creature.  <i>Heh, least he\u2019s too small to make fox kibble out anyone\u2026except maybe me\u2026</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just laughed at Akamaru\u2019s musing and ruffled the little pup\u2019s head assuredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled with some relief.  \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad to hear that,\u201d then his smile faded a bit as he turned to the kit a bit more somberly and added, \u201cbut\u2026you should know, this is only for a little while, so you wouldn\u2019t have to spend all that time alone in your cage.  But, well\u2026eventually, we\u2019re going to have to go back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama\u2019s smile softened a bit.  However unpleasant a notion, deep down, he knew he\u2019d eventually have to go back, especially if this was the Old Man\u2019s wishes for him.  And so, he nodded softly at the boy, looking down slightly.  Nevertheless, Naruto smiled assuredly at the young kit and warmly rested his hand atop his orange shoulder.  \u201cStill, that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t enjoy ourselves while we\u2019re out here, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama\u2019s spirits immediately lifted as his smile returned in full form, nodding his head all too eagerly.  Naruto smiled back at the creature, feeling a load of relief being lifted from his previously heavy heart.  It was still a rough situation, all things considered, but he was glad to be able to see this (currently) innocent creature wouldn\u2019t have to suffer in this state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter meanwhile, smiled warmly at the sight.  Catching this, Kiba grinned and playfully nudged the wolf with his elbow.  \u201cHehe, quite a sight, ain\u2019t it,\u201d he said.  Hunter simply nodded.  He hated to admit it, but the \u2018fearsome\u2019 Kyuubi he\u2019d heard of, in this current form, at this current size, and in his currently chipper mood, was bludgeoning the anthro upside the dome with what could only be described as \u2018maximum cuteness overdrive.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping his hands down to his sides eventually, Naruto took a few steps back, giving the young kit some room and asked, \u201cSo, Kurama, now that we\u2019re out here?  What would\u2019ja like to do first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young fox tilted his head slightly as he pondered for a moment\u2026</span></div></div>",

Kurama, for his part, blushed as red as a tomato beneath his orange fur. \"Eheheheh...sorry,\" he apologized, sheepishly rubbing his stomach with one arm. \"G-guess I'm a little hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Hunter replied faintly, sticking a finger in his ear and wiggling it. \"Never woulda guessed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, rumbles of similar intensity and length emitted from the bellies of the four non-Tailed Beasts in the room. As Naruto and Kiba clutched at their bellies, slight blushes rising on their faces, Hunter chuckled and said, \"Heh, guess we're a little hungry, too...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's own blush dissipated a bit, and he giggled. \"Heehee, ya think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, letting go of his stomach, managed a smirk, elbowing Naruto. \"Heh, guess goin' back and forth from your mind works up an appetite, eh, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Naruto elbowed Kiba back. \"Yeah, well, considering we barely touched our sundaes earlier, it would kinda make sense we were...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Kurama's question, Naruto and Kiba both directed their attention toward the young kit. \"Eh? What's what?\" Naruto asked, smiling at the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blinked, tilting his head a bit curiously. \"What's a sundae?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence reigned in the room for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're joking, right?\" Kiba asked, raising an eyebrow. \"A sundae! You know, lots of ice cream, toppings, cherry on top---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit's face scrunched up in a puzzled frown. \"What's ice cream?\" If anything, he sounded even <i>more</i> confused then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter raised a paw to answer him, but something suddenly occurred to him: from what he'd heard, Kurama, along with the other Tailed Beasts, was easily centuries old. If that were the case, they wouldn't have had anything like ice cream back when he and his companions were children...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, however, was not so quick to come to this conclusion. \"Come on, ice cream! It's cold and sweet and melty and...\" before he could ramble on to the increasingly confused fox much longer, Hunter stepped forward and placed a firm paw on Naruto's shoulder. This brought the boy up short, and his head swung up to look at Hunter. \"Hunter, what're you...\" Hunter said nothing, but smiled and gave the boy a wink. The message was clear: <i>I'll handle this.</i> Naruto pouted a bit, but stepped aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving Naruto a thankful nod, Hunter stepped forward. \"Weeeelll, I guess we COULD explain what ice cream is,\" he began, tail wagging slowly, \"buuuuuuut I think it's better if we showed ya.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Naruto's face lit up. \"Yeah! We're goin' back out for sundaes!\" He pumped his arms in the air, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, though he too was licking his lips at the thought of ice cream, frowned as something occurred to him. \"Wait,\" he began, stepping in. \"Is takin' Kurama out in public really a good idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter opened his muzzle to answer, but Naruto beat him to the punch. \"Kiba!\" Naruto hissed in a low voice. \"Keep your mouth shut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scowled at him. \"What? I'm just sayin', people might not take seeing the Nine-Tailed Fox well, and...\" he trailed off to a stop as he remembered that Kurama had none of his adult memories. His comments may have done a lot of damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you whispering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widening, both Naruto and Kiba faced Kurama, who was tilting his head curiously as his long ears twitched. Stammering, Naruto tried to explain. \"K-Kurama, we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo both his and Kiba's shock, Kurama giggled. \"You don't hafta whisper; I know I shouldn't go out into human villages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis comment took both boys off guard, and Hunter even asked, \"...really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Kurama exclaimed, smiling and nodding. \"There was this one time me n' Gyuki snuck into a human village, just to see what it was like, even though the Old Man told us never to go there 'less he was with us. And, well...\" His expression grew a  bit nervous, and he winced. \"The Old Man ended up having to pay, 'cause half the village got wrecked.\" All four of the non-Tailed Beast's eyes widened. <i>You know, suddenly I'm REALLY happy he got downsized...</i> Akamaru thought, whimpering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to their reactions, Kurama pouted a bit, puffing his cheeks out. \"I <i>told</i> that mean old cabbage merchant I was sorry about his cart...\" he focused back on the four, who had managed to smooth out their expressions somewhat. \"Besides, we didn't even hurt anybody!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinked for a couple of seconds. \"Well that's...good...\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Kurama replied, his grin quickly returning to his face. \"So, anyway, yeah, I know I can't go into villages, so that's not a problem. Still,\" he added, wincing as his tummy rumbled again. \"I wanna try some of this 'ice cream' you guys keep talkin' about. We don't hafta go into a village to get it, do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned, shaking his head. \"Nope, and I wasn't even planning to go into the village in the first place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't?\" Naruto and Kiba asked, their eyes widening. Akamaru, from within Kiba's hood, merely whined. <i>Why do I have a bad feeling about this...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter merely grinned wider. \"I was not.\" Then, to their surprise, Hunter walked over and grabbed the Kaepora Gaebora statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked. \"What're you doing with that thing again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded. \"Yeah, I don't think there's any ice cream in my head...\" Kurama, though he STILL had no idea what 'ice cream' was, couldn't help but giggle at his comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled. \"Nah, nah, nothing like that. See,\" he began, walking back over to his bag and procuring the Ocarina, \"I actually got those lovely little statues in quite a few places, and I can choose where I wanna go, so long as I picture the location in my mind. These folks in one particular location owe me a bit of a favor, so I'm heading there to cash it in, and then coming back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the ice cream?\" Kiba asked, tilting his head. That seemed a lot of trouble to go for for some ice cream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his irritation, Hunter smirked. \"Youuuuuu'll seeeeee,\" he singsonged. Scowling, Kiba opened his mouth to demand Hunter tell them, but the anthro cut him off. \"Oh, and you kids are gonna wanna stay away from the statue; don't wanna drag you along, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're leaving us?\" Kurama suddenly exclaimed, eyes widening. \"W-won't that leave us all by ourselves?\" He may have only just met Hunter, but he was the only adult in the room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's face twitched a bit, feeling sympathy as he remembered that, unlike Naruto and Kiba, Kurama did not have the benefit of his older self's memories, and as such was very much a child. \"I'll only be a little bit,\" he promised, his tone earnest. \"Besides,\" he added, smiling a bit, \"Naruto and Kiba might be small, but they got a lotta muster; you'll be fine with them.\" Naruto and Kiba beamed inwardly at the praise, the blonde giggling and folding his arms behind his head, and the little dog-nin winking and giving Kurama a thumbs-up. \"See? Nothing to worry about.\" <i>And besides, this might give them a chance to get to know each other a little better...</i> the wolf mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing himself back to the present, he walked closer to the statue, while the children scrambled to take cover behind the bed. Satisfied that they were far enough away from the spell's radius, he shut his eyes, concentrated, and brought the Ocarina to his muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind the bed, Naruto, Kiba, Akamaru, and Kurama heard that same short, repeating set of notes being played. Then, in a few moments' time, they caught a flash of white, a burst of light...and when they peeked over the bed, Hunter was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Hunter gone, the two boys, pup and young Nine-Tail sat idly for a moment.  Naruto glanced at the young kit curiously as he looked away somewhat nervously.  \"Huh?  What's wrong, Kurama?\" the boy asked.  \"Well, I'm...I'm not used to doing things without a grownup around.  Before, I had the old man, but now...I just, don't wanna do anything bad or get into trouble...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde boy laughed assuredly for a moment then playfully nudged the kit's arm, causing him to wince slightly; still not used to Naruto's playful demeanor, but nevertheless, he smiled nervously back.  \"Ah, heck, don't sweat it!  Nothing bad's gonna happen!  We're just gonna hang out for a bit before ol' wolfy comes back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama tilted his head curiously.  <i>Again with these foreign expressions...</i>  \"Hang out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba rolled his eyes, chuckling softly to himself.  <i>Oh brother...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Naruto paid no heed, instead, simply laughed and said, \"Oh, heh, sorry.  Hang out means to spend time together.  It's what people do when they want to get to know each other, or do fun things together.\"  At this, the kit's eyes lit up as he pipped in, \"Oooh!  That's what it's called?  In that case, me and the others hang out all the time!  It's really fun!\"  The others laughed to themselves, Naruto especially.  This was certainly not a side he expected to see of the Kyuubi, even in this state.  He ruffled the young fox's head playfully, eliciting a giggle from the kit as he added, \"Well, don'tchu worry.  Cause we're all gonna have a great time too, just you wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, there was a visible eagerness emanating from the young creature.  It's a strange notion that anyone could be this eager to just 'hang out' with people, but for a creature in Kurama's current state, to awaken to such a previously cruel situation, it really meant a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you two 'hang out' a lot?\" Kurama asked.  Both boys shared a glance and grinned at each other.  \"Heh, oh yeah, all the time,\" Kiba responded before wrapping his arm around Naruto's neck playfully and ruffling the boy's head as the pup atop Kiba's head barked happily.  Again, Kurama was a bit startled, but quickly relieved when he heard Naruto laughing as he pushed the other boy aside.  In the process, Kurama took notice of a bag in the distance behind the two boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, what's that?\" Kurama asked, pointing curiously at the bag.  The others turned to it.  \"Oh that?  That's Hunter's bag of doohickeys and thingamajigs!\" replied Naruto.  Again, Kurama tilted his head not having a clue, only this time, Kiba laughed and said, \"Yeah, don't worry, I didn't catch a word of that either.\"  Despite himself, Kurama couldn't help bit giggle at the funny sounding words Kiba clearly thought were silly too.  \"Those are Hunter's items.  Like, you saw his statues, that stick and his weird flute thing, right?\"  The kit bopped his head up and down, acknowledging Kiba's inquiry.  \"Well, that's where he keeps ALL his crazy stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed, before Kurama smiled and, a bit hopefully, asked, \"...Can I see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys glanced for a moment, until Kiba said, \"Tell ya what, we'll show you, since a lot of his stuff is kinda...well...fragi-errr, easy to break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiddy with excitement, Kurama happily trotted over to the bag, sitting patiently and excited to see more as the boys and pup rummaged around, looking for things that didn't seem...dangerous.  Immediately, both boys eyes widened.  Even Akamaru couldn't help but gape.  <i>Well, that's...different...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Naruto reached in and pulled out a rather wide bottle corked at the top.  Inside, was a glowing pink circular light with little transparent wings attached to it, fluttering about idly inside the bottle, shimmering with light, and absolutely mystifying the young kit as he loomed closer at the spectacle in the bottle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so pretty and shiny...!\" Kurama mused, \"...What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither boy had an answer until Naruto noticed a sticky with some scribbles written on it.  \"It says, 'Fairy - Keep in case attacked by...Ganon....dork?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba rolled his eyes.  \"That says DORF, you dork!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scowled at the other boy, as Kurama again giggled at their humorous back and forth.  Gently, they put it away and rummaged around until another interesting item caught their eye.  \"Saaaay, this one's new...\" Naruto said as he rummaged about and pulled out another interesting looking item.  Kurama was a bit startled by the almost eerie sight, but nevertheless, asked, \"W-what's that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe item in question appeared to a mask, one with strange red markings and at the center, what looked like a piercing cyclops-like eyeball.  Kiba examined the note attached to the back.  \"Huh, it's called, The Mask of Truth.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glanced at the sticky, and added, \"Wear to unlock secrets from inanimate objects, it says.  Also, 'Be Warned.  Statues are jerks.'\"  Raising an eyebrow, Naruto cautiously placed the mask over his face, much to the alarm of the boy, the pup and the kit.  Even Kiba had to admit that Naruto looked a bit freaky with that thing clamped over his face, but nonetheless, asked, \"...So?  How's it feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde just shrugged.  \"No different.  Lemme give it a test run,\" he replied, turning his attention towards the activated owl statue.  \"Alright, Kippula Gabbosomething...I command you to...uhh...talk, er something!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statue glowed ever so slightly, alarming everyone in the room, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Eh, buzz off, you little bonehead.  And take that mask off.  It looks even dumber than your face does!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four just gaped in silence for a moment, before Naruto took the mask off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Kiba muttered, dumbfounded that it actually worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Naruto muttered, a bit dumbfounded himself, before his face scrunched into an irritated scowl, \"statues really ARE jerks!\"  Quickly, he stuffed the mask back into the bag, when suddenly, the kit's tummy emitted yet another more than audible growl, startling the others slightly.  Rubbing it hungrily, he once again blushed and smiled a bit apologetically, before adding, \"I sure hope that wolf-person gets back soon.  I'm getting REALLY hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed as his and Kiba's own stomachs roared in agreement to Kurama's, though nowhere near as frightfully loud.  \"Heh, ah don't worry,\" Naruto started, \"I'm sure he'll be back in no time.  Til then, let's see what other cool stuff Hunter's got in here.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With that, Naruto and Kiba immediately went back to rooting around in Hunter's bag, doing their best to avoid anything that looked (or felt) too dangerous. All the while, Kurama sat expectantly, tails swishing eagerly. \"You guys find anything cool yet?\" the kit asked, a wide smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned at the kit, even as he continued rooting through the bag. \"Not just yet, but considering how much is in here, it probably won't be long till...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I got something!\" At Kiba's triumphant exclamation, both Kurama and Naruto glanced over at the little dog-nin as he rooted through the bag and, with a grin, withdrew a small item held it up in the air, inspecting it. It appeared to be a small, metal cylinder with some sort of button on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, curious, looked over at Kiba, and the object he was holding. \"Eh? Whaddaya suppose that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shrugged, turning the object over in his hands. \"Dunno, but it feels sorta light,\" he admitted. With some difficulty, he took it in one hand. \"Fees like you're supposed to hold it, but I'm not sure why...\" As he said this, his thum brushed against the button...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and he nearly dropped it as, without warning, a flash of light burst from the opening at the top. Luckily, he managed to bring his other  hand up quickly enough to regain his grip on it. \"Phew, that was close...\" he muttered to himself. Once he'd calmed a bit, he looked up at the item...and his and Akamaru's eyes widened. <i>Whoa....</i> Akamaru barked, a bit lost for words. Likewise, Naruto and Kurama were gaping at the object now held in Kiba's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cylinder now had what appeared to be a blade of pure energy emerging from it-the hilt, Kiba realized-glowing blue and humming audibly. \"A-a sword...?\" Naruto muttered, eyes widening. \"N-never seen one like that before...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-me neither...\" Kurama muttered, muzzle gaping wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, too shocked to say anything, merely nodded as he continued to stare at the sword, only tangentially noticing the hum it gave off. This continued for a few seconds before Akamaru whimpered, <i>Uh, Kiba? Maybe you should turn the blue, glowy sword off now...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, probably a good idea...\" Kiba muttered, eyes still focused on the weapon. He adjusted his grip to get closer to the button, but as the hilt shifted in his hands, the blade made an odd noise that was somewhere between a hum and a disruption of air. \"...eh?\" Tentatively, he moved the blade through the air again, once again making the odd noise. Then again, and again, and again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, a grin formed on Kiba's face. <i>Hey, that's...that's pretty neat.</i> Gradually, he began swinging the blade quicker, the blade humming and almost leaving a trail of light as it moved about. The children (and Akamaru) all stared awestruck, grins forming on their own faces. The same thought ran through all their heads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cooooooooooooool....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, though, Kiba tired of swinging the energy blade and flicked it off with his thumb. Setting it aside, he continued rooting through the bag, Naruto doing the same. As they did so, Kurama piped up, \"Um...where did Mr. Hunter get all this neat stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys and pup snickered a bit at \"Mr. Hunter\", but Akamaru managed to recover and bark, <i>Eh, he says he's been to a lot of different places, and that he likes to pick up stuff from there.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blinked. \"Really? What kinda places?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shrugged. \"Eh, he hasn't really been specific, but...\" he trailed off as something occurred to him. \"Wait...you understood him?\" At this, Naruto started, looking straight back at Kurama. The young Tailed Beast winced a bit; had he said something wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I did,\" Kurama admitted, scratching the back of his head. \"W-was I not supposed to? I mean, I'm sorry if I wasn't, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his relief, Kiba burst out laughing. \"Haha! Nah, you're good, Kurama. Guess I just sorta forgot that foxes are technically canines too, so it would make sense you'd be able to understand my little buddy here.\" He gave the dog a pat on the head, much to his delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled. \"Yeah, I guess it would...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis laughter dissipated as he noticed Naruto scowling, his eye twitching a bit. \"N-Naruto? Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde said nothing for a moment. Then:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?! I'm the ONLY one who can't understand a word Akamaru says?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did it; both Kurama and Kiba burst into a fit of laughter. \"Oh, shut up!\" Naruto snapped, incensed. But the two other children, in the grip of their mirth, only laughed harder. Grumbling, Naruto continued rooting through Hunter's bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the laughter died down, and Kurama settled back into a sitting position, smiling contentedly. \"Ya know, I gotta say,\" Kurama admitted as Kiba resumed rooting through the bag alongside the blonde, \"never thought I'd be 'hanging out' with humans like this, but you guys are pretty fun to be around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, his previous foul mood forgotten, beamed at Kurama. \"Heh heh, thanks!\" His smile grew thoughtful. \"But, ya know, hanging out isn't just having fun together; it's gettin' to know each other, too.\" Getting up, he walked over to Kurama, plopped down next to him, and threw a friendly arm about the kit's shoulders. \"So why dont'cha tell us a little bit about yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit surprised at the contact, Kurama nonetheless managed a smile. \"What do you wanna know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shrugged. \"What you like to do for fun, things you might like, things that might bug you,what you like to eat...ya know, stuff about yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama beamed. \"Oh, that stuff's easy!\" the kit exclaimed, eyes lighting up. \"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, as they do that, both Naruto and Kurama continue chatting amongst themselves; Naruto's arm still wrapped around the kits shoulders in a buddy-manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We spent a lotta time just talking to each other.  Some of us would even play every once in'uh while, but the Old Man liked it more when we behaved ourselves,\" Kurama explained, smiling as he thought fondly of his time with the other Nine-Tailed beasts and the Old Man.  Despite himself, Naruto snickered at the last part, \"So he probably didn't like it a whole lot when ya snuck into villages and busted cabbage crates, huh.\"  The kit frowned, rubbing the back of his fuzzy head.  \"It was just that one time!  Honest!\"  But Naruto just laughed and playfully ruffled the fox's head with his arm still wrapped around his shoulders, surprising Kurama at first, but eventually eliciting a giggle from the young fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And bugging, that's when you get attacked by insects?  Because I HATE spiders!\" Kurama exclaimed, earning a laugh from Naruto as he shook his head.  \"No no no, things that bug you mean, things that annoy you; things you don't like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooooh!\" Kurama exclaimed, finally getting it as his muzzle screwed to the side slightly in deep thought.  \"Weeell, I guess...Shukaku bugs me.  He's always so mean and angry...I don't like it when others are mean like that...\"  Naruto nodded, more than in agreement with the sentiment.  \"Heh, I hear ya,\" the boy replied, earning a sudden giggle from the kit.  \"Of course you hear me, you're sitting right next to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Naruto burst into a fit of laughter, playfully rocking the smaller sized fox a bit.  \"No, that means I understand what you're saying, and I feel the same way.\"  Again, Kurama giggled and rubbed the back of his head.  \"Heehee, sorry.  I hope me not understanding some of the things you say isn't getting annoying.\"  But Naruto just shook his head and smiled assuredly.  \"Nah, it's not annoying.  Heck, I actually like being able to explain some things to you.  It ain't often I get to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, both their tummies rumbled as they winced, then chuckled a bit some more.  \"On that note, what sorta stuff do ya like to eat?\" Naruto asked, to which Kurama beamed and said, \"Oh!  That's easy!  Whatever tastes yummy!\"  The boy just laughed, accepting that what Kurama said was as close to an accurate answer as he was likely to get.  \"Y'know something, Kurama?  We ain't so different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama just turned to the boy and tilted his head.  \"We aren't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it.  We both really like a lot of the same things, like being with our friends, getting into a bit of trouble here or there, we both love eating whatever tastes yummy, we both can't stand jerks...and...well, we both know what it's like to be alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama glanced more sincerely at the boy as he looked away, a bit somberly.  \"You mean, you were left alone too...?\"  To which, the boy sighed and nodded.  Kurama frowned sympathetically at the boy and rested his own hand against his shoulder.  \"I'm sorry.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Naruto was surprised, but then he recalled the situation, and just smiled warmly at the kit and, to some extent, at the irony.  Then, Kurama added, \"B-but you're not alone now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked up for a moment.  He glanced up at Kiba and Akamaru still digging around for items, and thought fondly of the time he was lucky enough to share with the two.  Be it going on missions together, training together, having wicked eating contests together, heck, even their constant bickering.  He then thought about his other friends, and all the memories he'd shared with them that he was grateful to have, even these few days hanging out with crazy ol' Hunter.  Then, he looked back at the it and smiled, almost gratefully, and nodded.  \"...No.  I'm not.  In fact, I've got some really great friends now, and I'm lucky they tolerate a bonehead like me, heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smiled, glad to hear that, but then added, \"You're not a bonehead!  I don't care what that mean old statue said, you're a nice, good person!\"  Naruto couldn't help but snicker, surprised someone would say he WASN'T a bonehead, but nonetheless, he smiled gratefully at the kit and said, \"Thanks, Kurama.  You're a pretty swell fella yourself.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young kit giggled bashfully, when suddenly, Kiba returned to the duo grinning impishly.  \"Well, nice to see you two are gettin' along nicely, but check THIS out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Kiba pulled out a very bizarre looking cap...resembling long bunny ears.  Both youths gaped.  \"Ummm...what is that?\" asked Naruto.  Kiba read the note aloud.  \"The Bunny Cap.  Speed plus one, heh, look what it does!\"  Kiba then placed the cap on his head, and immediately both Naruto and Kurama giggled at the ridiclous sight of Kiba with bunny ears.  Even Akamaru snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hehe, yeah you DO kinda look silly with those things...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kiba just grinned, and in an instant, vanished, causing both youths eyes to widen.  \"I know, speedy, ain't I?\"  Kiba's voice called, as the two turned and found him standing confidently behind him.  \"Whoa, those things really DO make ya fast!\" Naruto exclaimed as Kiba grinned.  Kurama just giggled, and added, \"But they ARE pretty silly looking.\"  Again both boys giggles as Kiba grumbled and took them off...</span></div></div>",

Still scowling, he took the Bunny Hood back to Hunter's bag. Setting it aside, he once again continued rooting through his bag. Looking back at Naruto, he asked, \"Well, Uzumaki? You gonna keep laughing like a dope, or are ya actually gonna help me look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill chuckling, Naruto got to his feet. \"Alright, alright; no need to get mad, dog-breath.\" Kurama giggled at the name, getting to his paws as well. \"I'm comin'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, the boy and fox made their way back over to Hunter's bag, joining the young dog-nin and his little ninja dog. Kurama sat to the side, his tails swishing in anticipation as Naruto knelt next to Kiba and continued rooting through the bag alongside his friend. \"Ya think there are any more nifty masks here?\" the blonde asked, his eyes still scanning the contents of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked, his previous grumpy mood forgotten. \"Only one way to find out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys continued rummaging through the bag for a few minutes, Kurama watching eagerly, until Naruto grinned. \"Hey, I think I've got something!\" Curious, both Kurama and Kiba looked toward the blonde as he pulled yet another mask out of the bag. This one resembled some kind of wild boar, two fangs sticking up from its lower jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, peeking out of Kiba's hood, woofed, <i>Wow, that's one ugly mask...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grimaced. \"No argument there, buddy...\" he gave a small \"heh!\", smirking as he looked toward Naruto. \"Buuuut it'd still be an improvement...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glared at the other boy. \"WHAT would be an improvement?\" he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Kurama replied. \"H-he said that mask would be an improvement on your f-face.\" That was all he managed before dissolving back into giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFace reddening, Naruto glared harder at Kiba. \"You're starting to sound just like that stupid statue, dog-breath...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shrugged. \"Ah, don't be like that,\" the boy replied easily. His eyes flew to the sticky note on the mask. \"Why don't ya read that note, so we can see what it does?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, yeah!\" Kurama nodded, a wide grin of anticipation on his muzzle. \"Tell us, Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as he might, Naruto couldn't help but crack a small smile at Kurama's sheer enthusiasm. Deep down, he wondered how this sweet, sensitive, <i>happy</i> fox kit had grown up into such a monster...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto forced the thoughts out of his head; now wasn't the time for them. Instead, he lifted the mask up so he could better see the note and read, \"'Mask of Scents': enhances your sense of smell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed. \"Heh, is that all it does?\" he asked, rubbing his own nose with a finger. \"Heck of a lot of good it'd do me. I'm an Inuzuka; we got the best noses in the business!\" Akamaru barked, <i>Yeah, and I'm an Inuzuka dog! Nothing gets past this sniffer!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a pretty good sense of smell, too,\" Kurama admitted, silently wondering just how good a human's sense of smell could actually be. \"Doesn't seem like it'd do a lotta good....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scowled at the others. \"Well, sorry, but not all of us are canines...or dog people,\" he amended, throwing glance toward Kiba. \"I'm trying this thing on.\" Slowly, he lifted the mask up to his face and placed it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing Naruto with the pig mask on, Kiba couldn't help but giggle. \"Heehee, I was wrong, it's not an improvement; ya just look like even more of a dummy with it on.\" Naruto, glaring at Kiba through the eyeholes, opened his mouth to retort, but Kurama spoke up first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee, you do look really silly!\" Kurama giggled, tails swishing eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rolled his eyes. \"Yeah, yeah, hilarious,\" he deadpanned. \"Just gimme a second to test this thing out.\" Preparing himself, he closed hi eyes, took a deep breath through his nostrils....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and promptly cried out in shock, falling first onto his rump, then his back. \"Gah!\" he yelped, tearing the mask off and covering his nose with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened. \"Naruto?!\" He darted over to the boy, looking over him worriedly. \"Are you OK?\" Kiba, on the other hand, was struggling not to bust a gut, wrapping his arms around his midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto lowered his hands enough to gasp, \"G-gah! It burns! So many smells...\" He threw a dirty look at the little dog-nin, who was swiftly losing the battle to contain his laughter. \"How the hell do you stand it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, even through his mirth, replied, \"Heh heh, y-you only just got a heightened sense 'a smell; I've been livin' with it my whole life.\" A snort escaped him. \"Most people just can't take it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, in spite of his worry, managed a smile. \"Y-yeah; its all about learnin' to filter out all the different smells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes flew up to Kurama. \"Th-thanks, but I think I'll stick with what I've got for now,\" the boy, grumbled, sitting back up and resting on his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Suit yourself.\" Shrugging, he continued rooting through the bag. Naruto, after a few moments of resting on his hands, got up and went back over to the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama watched eagerly all the while, tails swishing about. What kind of neat masks would they find next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden rumble from the kit's belly caused him to wince, reminding him that he was still rather hungry. <i>When's Mr. Hunter gonna be back?</i> he silently wondered, rubbing his orange-furred tummy. <i>I really wanna see what 'ice cream''s like, and why Naruto and Kiba seem to like it so much...</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Getting a grip on it, he hoisted it out of the bag and held it up for the rest of them to see. It was a surprisingly simple-looking mask; it was dark blue in color, and had no discernible eyeholes of any sort. All that distinguished it was a picture of a cartoony-looking skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama tilted his head. \"What sorta mask is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked at the fox kit. \"Lemme check.\" Holding it up so he could see the sticky note, he read, \"Blast Mask; creates an explosion around you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru perked up. <i>That sounds like it could come in handy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that also...\" Kiba's eyes widened. \"...hurts you. The hell?\" he muttered, lowering the mask. \"What's the point of using a mask that hurst you?\" Shrugging, he tossed it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought for a moment. \"W-well, maybe if you need a quick explosive or somethin' like that, and you're in a pinch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba gave Naruto a nonplussed look. \"What the hell would you even need an explosive for?\" Kiba replied, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scowled. \"H-hey, don't ask me!\" the blonde retorted, folding his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Kiba demanded, folding his own arms. \"You were the one who suggested it!\" Akamaru, from within Kiba's hood, wagged his tail a bit. <i>Here we go again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto reddened a bit. \"Well, you coulda thought about it and used that head for thinking instead of whatever the hell it is you use it for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's eyes widened. \"Seriously? You're calling <i>me</i> stupid?!\" Kiba demanded, slugging Naruto in the arm. \"You're one to talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto and Kiba continued bickering, neither they nor Akamaru paid attention to where the mask had landed; specifically, by Kurama. The kit, oblivious to the boys' arguing, had stared at the mask, almost entranced by it. <i>An explosion?</i> he wondered idly. <i>Who would make an exploding mask?</i> Making sure that neither Naruto nor Kiba were looking, he slowly reached out and grabbed the mask with both arms. Holding it up in the air, he turned it about this way and that, examining every inch of it. His muzzle screwed up in a puzzled frown. <i>I don't get it; it looks like its just a mask.</i> He held it closer, inspecting it. <i>What would make it explode?</i> Still utterly confused, he turned the mask around so that the skull face was facing him. Resting it against the floor and pinning it their with one paw, he slowly reached toward the skull symbol with the other one. <i>That's a weird looking skull...</i> Meanwhile, Naruto and Kiba continued bickering, oblivious to Kurama's investigations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumbass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dog freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ramen freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goofball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru watched as the boys went at it, resting within his perch on Kiba's shoulder. <i>Ah, it's true what they say: the best entertainment in this world is fr---</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKA-BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a small explosion immediately cut through his thoughts, and the arguments of the boys. Immediately, all three whipped their heads toward the source of it. There was a sizable, black, sooty spot from where they'd heard it, and in the middle of it lay the young Kyubi, sprawled out on his back and fur colored black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened in horror. \"Kurama!\" he exclaimed, overcome with fear for the kit. Bolting to his feet, he rushed over to him, Kiba and Akamaru following closely behind. Once he'd reached Kurama's side, he dropped down, leaning over the fox kit and inspecting him closely. His orange fur, as they'd seen, was colored completely black, and his eyes had taken on a rather swirly appearance. \"Kurama? Kurama!\" Naruto bellowed, shaking the kit's shoulder frantically. \"C'mon, wake up! Say something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully, the young fox groaned at that. \"Uhhhhh....\" Shaking his head a bit, he hoisted himself up onto his front paws, much in the way Naruto had done earlier. \"Kurama!\" Naruto exclaimed again. \"Are you OK?!\" Kiba and Akamaru said nothing, anxiously awaiting a reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama groaned again, reached a paw up to the back of his head, and rubbed it, the soot falling off to reveal his orange fur. \"That...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes suddenly flew wide open, and he looked toward the boys and dog...and his muzzle formed a huge grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awesome! Let's do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kiba, and Akamaru stared in disbelief for a few moments. Then, as one, they burst into laughter, falling onto the floor and clutching their middles. Even Akamaru rolled back and forth, unable to contain his relief and mirth. Kurama, initially confused, eventually succumbed to it as well, launching into an uproarious fit of laughter and falling onto his back, rolling about and shaking off the rest of the soot, revealing his orange fur and the flesh beneath it to be completely unharmed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unbeknownst to the four hysterical youths, a familiar white glow began to fill the room, until two large white wings emerged from the rift of time and space, and relinquished none other than a smiling Hunter and a MORE than bountiful surplus of items.  However, his smile was short lived as a look of confusion had overtaken him.  On the floor, he saw the four youths laughing uncontrollably and not too far away...<i>a small blast mark...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew the boys were rowdy...but THIS chaotic...?  That was a twist Hunter didn't see coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the four stopped dead in their tracks, eyes widening as they saw the wolf-person standing over them, eyebrow firmly raised as he nearly gaped at the war torn sight.  Nervously, Kurama propped back up to his front paws, sitting up straight.  \"Uh...h-hi, Mister Hunter!\" the young Kyuubi piped somewhat fearfully.  The boys, less fearful, but still a bit embarrassed, got up, still snickering slightly.  \"Hey, Hunter, did'ja get what ya needed?\" asked Naruto.  But the wolf didn't respond, still far too dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing a bit, Kiba rubbed the back of his head sheepishly.  \"Ehhh...y-yeah, MAYBE we kinda made a bit of a mess while you were gone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinked dully.  \"You don't say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his own fuzzy head sheepishly, Kurama stepped forward, frowning a bit as he lowered his head in shame.  \"P-please don't be mad at these guys.  It was my fault.  See, I asked them about your bag, and they started showing me all the really cool stuff you had inside...and then Naruto and Kiba found these really strange magical masks...and then I fiddled with one of them and it...\" he pointed towards the blast mark and the soot around them, \"...did that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at the devastation and then back at the ashamed kit, Hunter rubbed the back of his head a bit embarrassed himself.  \"Ugh...y'know, I keep meaning to dump that crazy Blast Mask off, but for the life of me, it keeps slipping my mind...\"  Internally, Hunter scowled to himself.  <i>Yeah, probably because I keep knocking myself out each time I use the thing...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then knelt down in front of the kit and rested a hand-paw atop the young creature's shoulder.  \"Y'know, kiddo, I gotta admire your honesty.  Not a lotta kits or kids your...kinda age, would take responsibility for their own actions like that.  Buuuuut really, this was more my fault than anything else.  I warned the boys about some of the dangerous stuff, but didn't figure to warn 'em about the exploding mask, heh.  You're not hurt or anything like that, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Hunter's surprise, the kit quickly shook his head 'no' and smiled gleefully.  \"Nope!  In fact, that was...actually really cool!  Heehee, my FACE blew up!\"  The other boys broke into a fit of laughter as Kurama snickered himself.  Hunter paused for a moment, processing the mental imagery of what Kurama had just told him, and; to Kurama's surprise, began laughing heartily himself.  \"Hehe, yeah, it IS kind of a rush, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid bopped his head up and down happily, causing Hunter to smile as he ruffled the fox's head, causing him to giggle happily as he did.  \"Well, I'm just glad you boys had a <i>blast</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Because puns.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Kurama smiled and added, \"Yuh-huh!  We had a lot of fun too!\"  Hunter rolled his eyes and smirked, the joke clearly over the young creature's head.  Naruto smirked then stepped towards the kit, patting him on the shoulder and smiling up at Hunter.  \"Yeah, it was awesome!  This lil fella's really fun and downright nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two smiled warmly at each other as Hunter himself, smiled at the sight.  It was an absolute tragedy that these two would never be able to stay friends.  But, given the circumstances, it was best to just enjoy the moment then and there.  So, he just grinned toothily and ruffled both the boy and kit's heads, causing them both to laugh and squirm as Hunter rose back up to his hind paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the young kit's orange furred belly again emitted an immensely loud growl as he whined a bit and clutched his tummy, trying to 'cool it' as it were.  Immediately, another thought entered the kit's mind as his face lit up.  \"Say, Mister Hunter, did'ja bring any of that Ice Cream you were talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Hunter grinned widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And THEN some...\"</span></div></div>",

Kurama's, however, was the widest. <i>Oh, wow; if Naruto and Kiba are THIS excited, this ice cream stuff must be really yummy!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaming, Naruto skidded to a stop, bringing Kiba, Akamaru, and Hunter up short behind him. \"So, whaddaya got for us, Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter folded his paws behind his back, grinning. \"Weeeelllll...\" He stepped to the side, sweeping an arm out  to indicate the supplies. Kurama's eyes merely widened at how much was there, but Naruto, Kiba, and Akamaru, fully grasping it, were beaming so widely their faces threatened to split in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before them was a massive, yet empty, glass dish, standing at least six feet above the floor. It was at least ten feet in diameter, and easily three feet deep. In short, it was easily the size of a small swimming pool. Even this, however, paled in comparison to what lay around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were dozens upon dozens of colorful tubs, each big enough to hold at least a couple gallons, scattered about. By the ecstatic looks on Naruto's and Kiba's faces, Kurama assumed they must have held ice cream. Around the tubs were glass jars easily as tall as the two boys (and young kit) were, filled to the brim with tiny, colorful objects. Some were round, others shaped like tiny sticks, and even some like circles. Around <i>those</i> were huge bottles (though smaller than the jars) with odd, cone-shaped projections on top, filled with thick-looking substances  that were colored everything from brown, cream, pink, and everything in-between. Amongst <i>those</i> were rather large cans made of steel, with protrusions coming out the top that were somewhat cylinder-shaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama gaped, totally taken aback by just how <i>much</i> was there, but that didn't compare to the looks of pure glee on Naruto's, Kiba's, and yes, even Akamaru's faces as their faces bore huge grins and their eyes practically gleamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding back snickers at their expressions, Hunter continued speaking, gesturing to the scattered products. \"Behold!\" he declared, earning giggles out of the boys. Grinning, he continued. \"Huge tubs of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, mint chocolate chip, cookie dough...pretty much every flavor known to man,\" his arm swung toward the jars, \"candy and sprinkles,\" he indicated the bottles, \"all sortsa sauces, from chocolate to strawberry and everything in-between,\" finally, he indicated the can, \"and of course, whipped cream!\" Naruto, Kiba, and Akamaru were practically salivating at this point, but Kurama just seemed more confused than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter took a deep breath. \"Of course, that ain't all...\" He moved around, revealing yet <i>more</i> supplies they had somehow missed the first time...and, Kurama, Kiba, and Akamaru swiftly realized, were producing absolutely wonderful smells. There were large, brown squares of some sort in square containers, bowls of bananas, jars of cherries in some sort of red liquid, and containers of some sort of brown sauce that was letting off steam. \"Fresh-baked brownies, ripe bananas, the sweetest maraschino cherries you've ever tasted, and, of course, plenty of hot fudge to go around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes lit up, and held his fists up in front of him. \"Oh man!\" he exclaimed happily. \"Can't wait to make sundaes outta all this stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter raised an eyebrow. \"Sundaes?\" he repeated. \"No no no, Mr. Uzumaki, we're only making one sundae.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Naruto and Kiba protested, looking utterly crestfallen. The little dog-nin spoke up first. \"But that's not fair! You brought all that stuff! Why would we only...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Hunter gestured to the massive glass dish. \"Why would we only...\" Kiba tried again, irritated at the interruption. However, as his eyes focused on the dish, the wheels in his head began to turn....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mr. Hunter?\" Kurama spoke up. \"N-no offense, but it seems kinda mean, bringin' all this stuff and then saying we can only make one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter merely grinned, confusing and upsetting the young kit...until Kiba's face once again split in a grin. \"No, he's not being mean,\" he assured the kit. \"In fact,\" he continued, sharing a grin with Naruto, who seemed to have come to the same conclusion. \"he's being really, really awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill befuddled, Kurama examined all the sundae supplies, then the dish, then back again...until it finally clicked. \"You don't mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Hunter declared, beaming. \"Today, gentlemen, we are to embark on the greatest of endeavors...\" he swung both arms out to the dish and the sundae supplies. \"Today, we make the Ultimate Ice Cream Sundae!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA resounding cheer went up from Naruto and Kiba, both of them pumping their arms in the air and whooping. Poor Kurama, however, was completely lost. \"Um, that's great,\" he began uncertainly, \"but, uh, why are you guys so happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gave the kit a befuddled look...before he giggled and slapped his forehead. \"Oh yeah, I almost forgot.\" He beamed at Kurama, then rushed over to the nearest tub of ice cream, grabbed it, and rushed it back to Kurama. Grinning, he peeled the top off, revealing it to be full of some thick, white substance. \"Here, Kurama!\" Naruto beamed at the befuddled fox. \"Just dip your paw in and scoop some in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Kurama did as he was instructed, digging his paw in, withdrawing a sizable scoop. At a reassuring look from Naruto, he opened his mouth wide, put the paw with his ice cream in, closed his muzzle around it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and his eyes suddenly shot wide open. \"Well?\" Naruto asked, grinning. \"How is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama didn't respond at first. He was too distracted by the chilled sensations that melted in his mouth, the sweet, creamy flavor that assaulted his tongue, and the pleasurable cold feeling he got as the ice cream ran into his tummy. <i>This is ice cream?</i> he wondered privately, slowly withdrawing his paw, finally closing his muzzle all the way. <i>This...</i> He gulped, swallowing the rest of the ice cream. Slowly, he looked at Naruto...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and the widest grin they'd seen from the young kit yet formed on his muzzle. \"This is so yummy!\" he exclaimed, swinging around to look at Hunter, Kiba, and Akamaru. \"It's cold, and sweet, and melty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Naruto folded his arms behind his head. \"Heh heh, told ya...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling happily himself, Kurama took a look at the assorted tubs of ice cream and the various toppings and other supplies. \"And...and we're really gonna be putting all of it...\" he looked toward the dish. \"...into that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Hunter stepped forward and ruffled the kit's head. \"Yes we are.\" He stepped back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and grinned as Naruto, Kiba, Akamaru, and Kurama all erupted into a second cheer, even louder and more uproarious than the first.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wasting no time whatsoever, Naruto, Kiba, Hunter and even Kurama had begun to scoop out the tubs of ice cream into the massive bowl, practically dumping the tubs together atop each other.  As they did, Akamaru watched, wagging his tail.  Just then, a thought occurred, causing him to bark aloud.  <i>Hey, guys!  Remember, I'm gonna need a corner without any chocolate anything!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed, nodding, as he began to start dumping a lot of strawberry ice cream in one corner, specifically for his puppy companion, all the while, the others, practically oblivious to the flavors they were even dumping at this point, just continued piling ice cream upon ice cream atop their specific corners each.  Naruto turned and watched Kurama continue dumping ice cream into the pool-like bowl, grinning giddily and; like before, saw his orange-furred body practically vibrating with excitement.  \"Oh boy, oh boy, this is gonna be the yummiest treat ever!\" the young kit exclaimed merrily as he poured out a tub.  Naruto laughed, and said, \"You know it!\"  Then his grin grew a bit more impish as he added, \"Hehe, hope you guys're gonna be able to keep up with me, cause I'm gonna be blazing through this monster like no tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba continued pouring a tub of Cookie Dough flavored ice cream on top of a previous gallon of Mint Chocolate Chip, he scoffed and said, \"In your dreams, bonehead!  You're probably just gonna give yourself brain freeze and-ohhhh wait, that requires havin' a brain.  Hehe, nevermind.\"  Hunter and Akamaru snickered as Naruto scowled angrily at the dog-nin.  Kurama just tilted his head, a bit taken back.  \"B-brain freeze...?\" he added, somewhat nervously.  Immediately, both boys turned to him, then Naruto just smiled assuredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.  No no, it's nothing.  Just, when ya eat ice cream, make sure you don't try and eat too fast, or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Or it'll f-freeze my brain...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the blonde laughed and shook his head.  \"No no no, nothing like that.  Brain freeze is just a head chill ya get for a few seconds.  It's not pleasant, but it passes.  It's more or less just a reminder to slow it down.\"  Hunter nodded then; with a smile, added, \"Besides, with so many majestic flavors in the bowl at once with SOOOO many toppings on top of them, why would you wanna hurry anyway?  Trust me, kiddo, the second you're scooping this stuff in your mouth, you're gonna wanna savor every single mouthful.\"  The kit thought for a moment.  That one pawful he scooped up <i>was</i> unlike anything he'd ever eaten.  And with so many other flavors to choose from, he could only imagine how delicious they were bound to be.  So, his nervousness subsided, and he was once again, merrily and excitedly dumping ice cream along with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, another thought entered the young Kyuubis mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, if the five of us actually eat ALL of this yummy ice cream, won't our tummies get really, really big?\" he asked the others, who immediately glanced amongst themselves, all four grinning impishly now as they each chuckled and nodded.  \"Ohhhh, you better believe it,\" Naruto replied, patting his own stomach eagerly.  Kurama snickered to himself, \"I don't think I've ever eaten that much before,\" he admitted, \"I once tried that one time we sneaked into that village, cause there was a building full of yummy crops and meats, but the Old Man got mad and told me not to do that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned and said, \"Well, ain't no one gonna tell you to stop THIS time.\"  Kurama grinned at the notion, rather eager to get into this upcoming endeavor.  But the truth was, there really was a LOT of ice cream that needed to be dumped into the gigantic bowl, and it was taking quite a while.  However, slowly but surely, they managed to dump every single tub into the bowl, towering it higher than any of them had ever....EVER seen a bowl of ice cream in their lives.  Hunter nodded with pride at the sight while the others simply gaped at Mt. Sundae.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!  And now....the Coup de gr\u00e2ce...\"  Hunter said, before turning towards the toppings.  \"Boys, if you'd be so kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than eager, the other youths hopped towards the many many toppings, and proceeded to grab whatever they could fit in their arms (or paws) and dump them into the ice cream.  Kurama examined each of his toppings, not quite sure what any of them were, so he'd occasionally take a sample bite to see what they tasted like, and sure enough, his eyes widened even more than before.  \"Wow!  Even the stuff we're putting on TOP of the ice cream tastes really yummy!\" he exclaimed as he proceeded to just dump whatever he could into the bowl.  Both Naruto and Kiba laughed and joined him, doing the same as Hunter grabbed one of the many sauces and proceeded to gracefully pour it atop the mountain.  This went on for quite some time, each side; a plethora of flavors, toppings and sauces, and Akamaru's own section, void of any chocolate, but nonetheless, ample in flavors and cherries especially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it was finally over, all five simply marveled at the sight.  The sight was almost TOO GOOD to be true...and if they didn't know better, they could have sworn they heard heavenly voices hymning in the background as they continued to gape.  But nonetheless, they shook it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready, boys, cause this...is gonna be the single best dessert any of you ever have...EVER,\" Hunter replied, grabbing a large spoon and handing the others large spoons as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned to Kurama and asked, \"You ready to taste pure flavor, Kurama?\"  The young kit bopped his head up and down quickly, eyes never leaving the sight of the monstrous bowl carrying an obscene amount of ice cream, toppings, sauces, and all smothered by a layer of whipped cream and cherries.  It was just picture perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, boys, let's dig-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hunter could finish, the four youths IMMEDIATELY dove in, shoveling as much ice cream as they could possibly fit into their mouths at once.  \"...In,\" Hunter finished, chuckling to himself, before diving in himself.</span></div></div>",

Naruto, Kiba, and Kurama, on the other hand, had to stand on their tip-toes (or paws) just to reach the dish, but none of them seemed to mind in the slightestKurama, in particular, dug into the sundae with relish. <i>Mmmmmm!</i> the young Kyubi exclaimed inwardly, giggling even as he put a spoonful of ice cream that was hefty with toppings and sauces into his mouth. <i>This is so yummy! There are so many different flavors, but they're all so good!</i> Gulping down his mouthful, he licked his chops, giggled again, and dove right back in. <i>The stuff we put on top of it is yummy, too; makes it even better!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba, obviously, were greatly enjoying the sundae, if their wide grins as they shoveled spoon after spoonful into their eager mouths (which were alread starting to get splattered with melted ice cream and toppings) were any indication. \"Oh MAN!\" Kiba exclaimed through a particularly large mouthful. \"This has to be the best sundae I've ever tasted!\" He gulped the mouthful down and glanced over at his little buddy, who was currently sticking his head into the veritable mountain of ice cream as he chowed away. \"How ya holding up over there, Akamaru?\" At this, the tiny pup withdrew his head, and Kiba giggled as he saw the dog's entire head  was covered in whipped cream, ice cream, and a good few sprinkles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnperturbed, Akamaru licked his muzzle. <i>I don't care how big of a bowling ball I'll look like when this is over!</i> Akamaru barked happily, waving his tail. <i>There's so much ice cream, and toppings, and flavors...I just can't get enough of it!</i> With that, the pup dug his head back in, not wanting to let the delicious sundae sit idle for a moment longer. Grinning at the sight, Kiba dug his own spoon back in, gteting a huge spoonful of ice cream, hot fudge, and steaming hot brownie, before shoving the whole thing into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNAruto giggled as he withdrew a spoonful filled with strawberry sauce, vanilla and chocolate ice cream, rainbow sprinkleos and some bananas. <i>Oh wow, even the fruit tastes amazing!</i> Naruto thought gleefully, chewing rapidly. \"Gotta agree with ya, dog-breath,\" Naruto said out loud, looking toward the little dog-nin, \"this is, hands down, the BEST damn sundae I've ever had!\" He beamed up at Hunter, who was just as busily shoving ice cream into his mouth. \"Thanks a bunch, Hunter! You're the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, even as he withdrew the spoon, smiled back down at the boy, reaching one paw out to ruffle his head. \"Heh, nothing but the best for you boys...\" Even as Naruto giggled, the anthro turned his attention back to the monstrous sundae and immediately resumed digging in. Even as Naruto did the same, he couldn't help but think, <i>He's been so nice to all of us, and he just met us a few days ago!</i> He smiled warmly, even as he shoved a spoonful overflowing with sauces into his maw (and splattering some around his lips in the process). <i>I should try and do something nice for him...</i> Abruptly, his stomach growled, as if to remind him \"Sundae now, nice later.\" Unlike at the ice cream place, Naruto was all too happy to oblige, and dove right back into the massive chilled dessert alongside the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, they forked spoonful after spoonful into their eager mouths, internally delighting at the sheer abundance of textures and flavors, even as they dug their utensils back in for more. The boys (and Kurama) were heedless of the bits that splattered on their faces, or of crumbs and pieces that tumbled down their upper torso garments (and fur, in the young fox's case.) They went at a good clip, rapidly shoving spoonfuls into their mouths, yet somehow taking enough time to savor each and every flavor before going back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter took a momentary pause to check out their progress; true, they had just begun a few minutes ago, but they'd still been going at a decent clip; he hoped they weren't going through it too quickly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his relief and delight, the monstrous sundae hardly looked touched at all. Made sense, considering how much was in the dish, but he'd still been a little worried...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No need for that,</i> Hunter thought, shaking his head and smiling. <i>Size this monster is, our guts'll start showing progress well before the sundae does...</i> With that exciting thought, Hunter dove right back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes ticked by, and the five continued devouring as much of the delicious cold dessert as possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>More and more time passed, with not a single boy or canine showing any signs of slowing down anytime soon.  It was such a phenomenal experience; to be savoring such a vast amount of flavors with every single mouthful gulped down.  Despite every bite and mouthful already taken, each one managed to taste completely new, whether it be the mixture of flavored ice creams, or the toppings, or sauces, or everything in between.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a single one of them had ever had a taste experience remotely like it, and that went doubly so for the young Kurama, who merrily continued gulping down mouthful after mouthful, with a more than merry smile across his ice cream smeared muzzle.  The flavors exploding on the tip of his tongue, the nice cooling sensation traveling down his throat and into his belly, and the sight of such happy faces (equally mesmerized by the treat) was such an overwhelmingly wonderful experience for the young fox kit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time had passed, Kurama finally pulled back from the massive bowl for a moment and licked his muzzle, giggling happily as he did.  \"Mmmm, I can't believe I've never had such a wonderfully yummy treat before!\" exclaimed the young Tailed-Beast as he rubbed his tummy happily with one paw, earning some chuckles and nods of agreement from the others, before immediately digging i for more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kurama happily rubbed his belly, he paused for a moment, and glanced down curiously at his midsection, staring somewhat surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith such delightful flavors overwhelming the kits' senses, he hadn't noticed just how much ice cream he had already eaten, as he discovered that his stomach had now distended outward a bit, creating a noticeable bulge in his middle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow...have I already eaten that much ice cream?</i> thought the kit as curiosity took him.  Immediately after, he glanced back at the others, and sure enough; Naruto, Kiba, Hunter, even little Akamaru's tummies had all bulged outward slightly.  Gulping down another hearty mouthful, Naruto smacked his lips, then noticed the distracted Kyuubi.  Wiping his mouth with his forearm, he turned to the kit and asked, \"Hey, Kurama, everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama turned to the boy and nodded, then rested one paw atop his orange furred tummy.  \"Oh, yes, everything's more than okay!\" exclaimed Kurama happily.  \"I'm just surprised that our tummies are already starting to get bigger when we barely touched any of the ice cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter wiped his mouth and smirked.  \"Well, whadduya expect, kiddo?  There's a LOT of ice cream, and not a lot of us, heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled and shook his head.  \"Ohhh ho ho ho, trust me, THIS is nothing,\" the boy exclaimed, patting his belly for emphasis.  \"Just wait til we actually start to put a real dent in this giant sundae.  We're all gonna look like we swallowed boulders that swallowed smaller boulders!\"  A bit surprised by the mental imagery, Kurama nonetheless giggled, actually kind of anxious to see such a silly sight from these boys and other canines.  \"Heehee, good thing we aren't outside then!  Otherwise, we'd have to roll ourselves around like boulders too!\" joked Kurama, earning a few laughs from the others, as Akamaru shuddered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Yeaaaah, it's not exactly a...pleasant experience having to roll around from place to place, trust me...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, Akamaru was just praising the stars above that neither Tsume nor Kuromaru were around to witness such an inevitably embarrassing sight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Kiba just laughed and was about to ruffle the pup's head, but stopped...and immediately burst into a fit of giggles.  \"Eh?  What's up, dog-breathe?\" asked Naruto, earning the curiosity of both Hunter and Kurama.  \"C-c-check out A-Akamaruuuhooohohooho!\" responded Kiba, best as he could between his laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, the others glanced just as Akamaru realized what was going on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, the little pups' face had been completely consumed by whipped cream, only this time, there were a few sprinkles scattered right where his maw was, and right above his eyebrows, making him look like he had a sprinkled smiley face gradually melting into a frown.  And the cherry on top was a LITERAL cherry on top of the pup's head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of moments, Naruto, Kurama and even Hunter had all burst into a fit of laughter as Akamaru just stood atop the chair, flushing red with embarrassment beneath his fur...and beneath the whipped cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Have I mentioned how glad I am that Tsume and Kuromaru aren't around to see this...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking the whipped cream and sprinkles from his face, Akamaru tilted his head back and allowed the cherry to roll towards his little maw for him to immediately gulp it down.  Wiping tears of laughter from his eyes, Kiba ruffled the bemused pup's head playfully.  \"Ah, c'mon, don't sweat it, boy.  It's all in good fun, you know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru scoffed and nodded.  <i>Yeah, yeah, all I know is there better be a really good tummy rub waiting for me after we finish this monster...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just grinned and nodded.  \"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Akamaru's tail started wagging a bit as he chuckled, and immediately dug his little face right back for more, while the others quickly joined him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more and more time went on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The five kept on digging into their ice cream, delighting in the explosions of flavor and sweetness that assaulted their taste buds. They each had their own reactions to this, though it all resulted in them eating faster and faster, eager to get more of the creamy, cool flavors: Hunter wagged his tail and grinned, Naruto, Kiba, and Akamaru giggled as their young minds marveled at just how <i>yummy</i> the sundae was, and even Akamaru was shaking his rump and wagging his tail at the same time, almost overwhelmed by all the flavors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more and more ice cream and toppings entered their gullets, their tummies slowly but surely grew to accommodate it. The slight bulges under Naruto, Kiba, and Hunter's upper garments grew increasingly larger, growing rounder and making more and more of an impression. Akamaru's now concave tummy slowly swelled, becoming more of a distinct round shape, and the bulge in Kurama's middle slowly distended further outward, much to the kit's fascination...and utter delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh wow, lookit my tummy growing!</i> the kit giggled, poking his midsection with one arm even while the other spooned more ice cream into his waiting mouth. <i>This is fun!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five continued, eating more and more of their obscenely large sundae. As the minutes ticked by, their midsections slowly but surely swelled bigger and bigger as more of the chilled dessert went from the dish to their bellies. Hunter's belly bulged bigger and bigger under his tank top, Kiba's tummy pushed his hoodie out further and further (of course, missing the stripes that ran down from his shoulder), Akamaru's tummy slowly grew further and further down from his torso, Kurama's belly pushed outward even more, and Naruto...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised his eyebrows as he felt his tummy becoming a bit tight. <i>Huh...that's weird...</i> Stepping back from the massive dish, he looked down and examined his tummy. It now appeared as though he'd swallowed a basketball; looking up, he noticed that the others, still engrossed in their treats, appeared to look the same (with the exception of Akamaru, who looked as though he'd swallowed an orange whole), but the sundae <i>still</i> looked as though it had barely been touched. <i>Wow,</i> Naruto marveled privately. <i>Just how big are our guts gonna be by the time this is over?</i> He felt the snugness again, and he once again looked down, examining his belly closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basketball-sized appendage still remained under his button-down shirt, but it was pressing rather noticeably against it, the buttons pushing outward. Naruto blinked. <i>Huh; never thought a shirt could feel tight like that...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of his eye, Kurama caught Naruto examining his belly. Confused, he swallowed his current mouthful and looked toward the boy. \"NAruto?\" he asked, licking some sauce and melted ice cream from his muzzle. \"Are you OK? Do you have a tummyache?\" At the question, Hunter looked down at Naruto as well, and Kiba glanced over at his pal. Even Akamaru withdrew his head from his corner (thankfully devoid of any whipped cream 'faces' this time around) and looked over at  the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivately touched at how concerned they all appeared, Naruto smiled. \"Nah, it's nothing like that. It's just...\" he gestured to his stomach pressing against his shirt. \"My tummy's starting to feel a little tight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter raised an eyebrow, getting the beginnings of an idea. \"That right?\" he asked, massaging his basketball-sized belly with one paw. \"Must be all those buttons...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded. \"Yeah,\" he added, fiddling with his necklace a bit, \"ya don't usually wear those kinds of shirts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama stared at the boy's shirt, the fabric and buttons being noticeably pushed against. \"Ya might wanna unbutton that, Naruto, or your tummy's gonna start hurting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, reaching his hands down to his shirt. \"Yeah, I guess I should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes suddenly flew wide open as his mind fully processed what was going on. His button-down shirt was feeling tight because his growing belly was putting pressure on it, and if he ate any more like that, it would only grow tighter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin slowly spread across Naruto's face. <i>Just like a bunch of my shorts and pants have done before,</i> he thought. And yet, he'd always fought past the pain and discomfort, until the constricting tightness of his pants had \"popped\" away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama tilted his head. \"Naruto?\" he asked , unsure as to what the boy was thinking. Hunter and Kiba, on the other hand, looked at each other and smirked. Yep, they'd seen this coming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...as did a certain puppy, who whined and covered his eyes with his ears. <i>Well, this is gonna be fun...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto?\" Kurama asked again, clearly concerned. \"Are you feeling OK?\" To the kit's relief, Naruto looked at him, beaming. \"Never better, Kurama, never better...\" he gestured to his shirt and its buttons. \"'Course, I'll feel even better once I pop these suckers off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened. \"Pop..?\" he began, before Naruto smirked and dove right back into the sundae, eating faster than ever. Grinning, and not wanting to be shown up, Kiba did the same, with Akamaru following close behind. Shrugging, Hunter dove back in, but Kurama could have sworn he saw a big smile on his muzzle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtterly befuddled, the poor Kyuubi nonetheless shrugged and got back to eating his sundae. <i>Well, Naruto seemed excited, so it can't be anything too bad....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes passed, and NAruto shoveled more ice cream into his mouth...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As more time ticked away, the boys and canines just continued to shovel more and more various ice cream flavors smothered with various toppings down their throats.  Same pace, same newfound delight.  All the while, their bellies continued to swell outward more and more with each passing gulp.  Both Kiba and Hunter had eaten enough to where both their stomachs had gotten so big that a sliver of flesh was now showing beneath their upper body attires.  Akamaru's tummy had distended beyond the point of 'orange', and now looked as though he had swallowed a melon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's belly had grown to distend outward to about the same size as Kiba and Hunter, though that didn't slow the kit down remotely.  Instead, his pace maintained its' steady rate, since he didn't want to miss a single bite of this delicious and frosty treat.  He'd also stop periodically as he consumed more and more ice cream, to examine how big his tummy had gotten, and then poke at it, giggling happily as he felt his tummy bounce with the simplest touch, earning the attention of the others, and earning a few chuckles before they would promptly jump back for more ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Naruto...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's pace had hastened a bit more than the others after he felt his gut getting cramped beneath his button down shirt.  His tummy had bloated more and more, but appeared constricted beneath his shirt, to where some flesh was showing between the straining buttons barely containing his torso.  Nonetheless, he soldiered on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ate, he gulped down his last mouthful, he winced, feeling his belly getting tighter and tighter.  Again, Kurama caught this, and glanced with concern for the boy.  \"Naruto?  Are you okay?  You look like you're in pain,\" the kit asked worriedly.  To which, the boy smiled and nodded.  He was about to open his mouth and assure the kit was fine, but then he heard what sounded like a slight tearing, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP! POP! POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widened, Kurama ducked as a few of the bottom buttons on Naruto's shirt blasted clean off his shirt and banged against the wall, freeing the bottom of his belly just slightly, and easing some of the tension to the rest of his shirt.  \"Ahhh, much better,\" exclaimed Naruto, almost going rag doll for a a moment as he slouched back a bit and patted his tummy happily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he felt his tummy surge outward just slightly, he felt the lowest button strain just a little more, until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last one ricocheted off the wall and bounced right back\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" yipped Kurama, clutching at his muzzle in pain.  Immediately, Naruto's eyes widened with embarrassment.  \"Oops!  Ehehe, sorry 'bout that, Kurama.  You okay?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit rubbed the tip of his still tender muzzle, then, after wincing a bit, glanced back at Naruto, and\u2026burst into a fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee!  Wow, that was awesome, Naruto!  I can't believe you actually managed to bust your buttons like that AND nail me right in the nose!\" the kit exclaimed merrily, still rubbing his muzzle and nose, but giggling as he did.  \"Maybe a little warning next time though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling as he rubbed the back of his head sheepishly, Naruto nodded.  \"Heh, consider it a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just chuckled to himself.  \"Good thing you ain't tryin' to bust a belt buckle, bonehead\u2026heh, imagine how bad it'd smart to get pegged with THAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others just laughed some more as Akamaru shook his head.  <i>C'mon, even Naruto isn't boneheaded enough to try and bust his belt buckle\u2026right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed and shook his head.  \"Nah, I doubt it.\"  He then smirked to himself.  <i>But it WOULD be pretty epic if he tried, hehe...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glanced back at the kit as he resumed stuffing his face with even more ice cream, smiling warmly at the happy creature.  Internally, he looked down for a moment, and, a bit more somberly, thought, <i>Y'know, I'm gonna miss seeing him...like this...</i>  The boy continued to ponder, wondering how and why the kit would eventually go so wrong.  But, as with Hunter's previous musings, pushed those thoughts back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Screw it, no use dwellin' on what coulda or woulda been, just enjoy the present!</i> the boy thought happily to himself, then, after feeling the buttons on his tummy still straining, he grinned a bit more toothily and turned to the kit and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, somethin' tells me you guys are gonna wanna start ducking pretty soon,\" Naruto said, grinning impishly as he turned back to the massive bowl of ice cream and resumed stuffing his craw with more and more diverse and bountiful flavors...</span></div></div>",

Of course, there was still the majority of it left, but that didn't concern any of them; all that concerned them was getting more and more of the delicious frozen dessert into their waiting maws. And, predictably, their tummies continued expanding as more and more entered into them. Hunter and Kiba's tummies continued pushing out, forcing their tank top and hoodie, respectively, up higher and exposing more flesh. Akamaru's belly grew lower and lower to the chair, until, finally, it began brushing against the chair. Akamaru blushed under his fur, well aware of what was happening, but he found himself pulled back to the ice cream, unable to resist the flavors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, even as he spooned more ice cream into his muzzle, poked his tummy with the other hand, giggling as it slowly grew larger and larger. <i>Heehee, this feels so funny!</i> the kit thought gleefully, giving it a light smack and practically squealing as the growing appendage bounced a bit. <i>By the time we're done, my tummy's gonna be so big, I'll be able to roll around, just like Isobu!</i> Squeezing his eyes shut as he grinned, he continued spooning the treat into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, grinning eagerly, spooned heaping spoonful after heaping spoonful into his mouth. He winced as the remaining buttons on his shirt strained against his growing belly, but he pressed on. He'd endured long enough to bust four of his shirt buttons, and he wasn't about to give up now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Naruto had four buttons remaining on his shirt: one directly over his navel, with another three going upward. All of them strained extremely noticeably, and it was anyone's guess as to which would come flying off next. To Naruto, of course, it made no difference; he was gonna bust them all, anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more they ate, and bigger and bigger their tummies grew. And, slowly but surely, the massive sundae began diminishing....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winced as he felt his buttons cutting into his belly more than ever,but he pressed on. <i>Not long now...</i> he thought, grinning. With this, he began spooning ice cream in faster and faster, his buttons quivering faster and faster, and cutting even more into his skin. He didn't know which, but one of 'em was gonna come flying off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing, Naruto called out, \"Hey, guys! Incoming!\"  At this, his four companions looked up, eyes widened, before they ducked down. Giggling, Naruto reached his spoon back in, even as his buttons quivered, took a huge spoonful, stuck it in his mouth, swallowed....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and the button above the one that was covering his navel burst off, flying straight off and whizzing over Kurama's head. Naruto, giving the kit an apologetic glanced, nonetheless giggled again. \"Oh, man, that felt great! I can't wait till,,,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes flew wide open as the bottom at the very top of his chest came whizzing off, flying off...and hitting Akamaru right in the rump. Yiping, the dog jumped a bit, pulling his head out of the ice cream and glaring at Naruto. Naruto laughed nervously. \"H-heh, sorry, Akamaru. I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn't help letting out a loud giggle as the one of the two remaining buttons on his shirt-the one between his chest and his navel-popped off, flying off and somehow flying clear over the sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, standing back up, grinned. \"Heh, three in a row; that's gotta be some kinda record.\" Naruto grinned, scratching the back of his head sheepishly. \"'Course, ya still got one left...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Naruto blinked, looking down. Sure enough, there was one button remaining on his shirt, the one that barely covered his navel. At this point, though, the loss of the rest of his buttons meant that the sides of his nearly-opened shirt were pushed all the way to the side, framing his exposed chest and belly. Even as the last button struggled valiantly against the horrendous pressure, it was clear it was horribly tight, and when the button gave. \"Huh, you're right...\" He looked back up at Hunter and smirked. \"Heh, only one thing for it, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Kiba got up as well, curious, in spite of himself, to see what would happen. Kurama, hearing this, looked back up, his eyes widening and his muzzle widening in a grin in anticipation. Even Akamaru pulled his head back out of the sundae, looking at Naruto curiously. Seeing he had an audience, the blonde grinned. Far be it from him to disappoint them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he dove back into the sundae, shoving spoonful after massive spoonful in his mouth. With each one, his belly bulged more and more, placing even more strain on the final button. Then, with one final swallow...</span></div></div>",

Grinning, Naruto turned to them and said, \"Heh, ya might wanna d-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a great snap, the button shoots off Naruto's shirt like a rocket, barely missing Hunter as it hit the wall, ricocheted back, hit the bowl, bounced back on the wall again, and finally, surprised Kiba as it nailed the young dog-nin right in the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" yipped Kiba, startled as his hands snapped to his face, earning snickers from the others, especially Akamaru.  <i>Not so fun, is it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling, he glared back in annoyance at Naruto, who was also snickering to himself.  \"Heh, sorry bout that, Inuzuk-\" Naruto's sarcastic apology fell short however.  Seems that button finally freeing itself and exposing the boys' navel and opening his shirt completely, had also released his tummy from the constraints the shirt was causing him completely.  As a result of which, his belly pushed outward considerably; as though a rush of water pushing outward past the now breached floodgates as it were, and the sudden force from the boy who was previously standing on his tip toes was enough to make him waver uncontrollably and lose his balance, until finally, he fell backwards and comically landed flat on his rump with a great \"OOF!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence, until everyone still standing burst into a fit of uproarious laughter.  \"Smooth, bonehead, reeaaaal smooth!\" muttered Kiba between laughs.  Naruto just folded his arms together and grumbled angrily to himself while the laughter eventually faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to the boys' surprise, he found an orange furred paw held out towards him.  Looking up, he saw a smiling Kurama standing before him, offering his hand to assist the boy back to his feet.  Despite his embarrassment, Naruto couldn't help but smile gratefully at the kit as he took his hand, and with surprising strength, helped to hoist the back to his feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I appreciate the help, Kurama!\" said the boy with some gratitude to his voice as he patted the kit's shoulder.  Kurama just giggled and said, \"No problem!  Sure, it was pretty funny watching you fall flat on your rump like that.\"  In the background, both Kiba and Akamaru snickered to themselves.  \"And then some!\"  the dog-nin added.  Then Kurama said, \"But that was still really cool the way you managed to force your tummy to push off that last button the way you did!  I've never seen anything like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the young kits' enthusiasm and cheeriness was so remarkably heartwarming for the boy that he couldn't help but smile and ruffle the top of his head, earning a giggle from the young Kyuubi.  \"Aww, now you're just bein' too nice,\" replied Naruto, chuckling as he did.  Hunter snickered to himself and added, \"Kid's right, y'know.  I knew it was gonna be an epic last snap, but the bouncing off the walls and bowls?  Even that I didn't see comin'!  And only partially cause I was trying not to get nailed right between the eyes, hehe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba chuckled, \"Yeah, I guess that was pretty cool...y'know, except where it landed...\" he pointed to the button imprint still on his forehead, earning laughs all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama then giggled and pointed towards the boys' much larger belly and said, \"Wow, lookit how much bigger your tummy looks without all those buttons holding it back!\"  Glancing down at his now exposed chest and bloated belly, the boy smiled and gave his tummy a hearty pat, causing it to bounce just slightly, much to Kurama's amusement.  \"Yep!  And all that button snappin's freed a lotta restriction, and I'm ready for more!  How about you?\"  The young kit bopped his head up and down eagerly as his tails wafted with excitement.  Naruto laughed then said, \"Well, then what're we all standin' around for?  This monster ain't gonna eat ITSELF, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, all five turned their attention back to the sundae, and in no time at all, proceeded to get right back to town, shoveling as much ice cream as they could possibly fit into their maws.  All the while, their tummies steadily increased in size to accommodate with every single ample mouthful gulped down into their eager gullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as more and more time began to press on...</span></div></div>",

Akamaru, having been sticking his head into the sundae to eat it, ended up splattering even more ice cream, sauce, and sprinkles over his head, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, their tummies had swollen even more, to the point where their bellies had gone past \"basketball\" to \"small beach ball\"; Hunter's tank top and Kiba's hoodie now hiked a couple of inches above their navels (scrunching up the stripes that ran down from the dog-nin's shoulder in the process), while Naruto's belly, unrestricted by his shirt buttons, slowly pushed outwards, past his button-down. Kurama'a's belly, easily as big as Hunter's, Naruto's, and Kiba, continued pushing out in front of him. Glancing down, he gave it a hearty pat, giggling as he saw it bounce. Then, as it settled down, he looked closer...and began giggling even harder. <i>Heehee, my tummy must really be getting big; I'm startin' to have trouble seeing my feet!</i> Indeed, his (small) beach-ball sized belly had expanded out enough that his hind paws were now partially obscured by his distended orange belly. Any further, and he wouldn't be able to see them at all... This thought, of course, only induced another round of giggles in the kit, and he immediately dove back in, shoveling more and more into his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's belly was now resting firmly on his chair, and his belly had even begun forcing his hind legs apart. Feeling this, Akamaru whined to himself. <i>Oh man...any more, and I'm gonna end up looking like a bowling ball again...</i> He examined the ice cream that was still left. <i>Scratch that...I'll look like a freaking <b>beach ball!</b></i> As soon as that thought entered his head, though, some strawberry ice cream dripped into his mouth, and  he was reminded just how cold, creamy and <i>oh so yummy</i> the sundae was. <i>How do I keep on getting dragged into these things?</i> the pup lamented, even as he dug his head back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of all this, they did not let up in the slightest, shoveling more and more ice cream in their mouths and slowly inflating their bellies bigger and bigger. As they did so, the giant sundae continued to diminish....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, even as he shoveled ice cream in with one paw and rubbed his exposed belly (which continued to stick out more and more as his tank top rose up further), he glanced around at the children, all spooning ice cream into their mouths, all practically paiting their faces with ice cream and toppings, and all grinning and giggling. Hunter couldn't help but smile warmly at the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aww...they look kinda cute, having fun like that...</i> the anthro thought fondly. He watched as they continued spooning ice cream rapidly into their mouths, then at their engorged bellies that continued to swell bigger. <i>Oh wow...they've eaten that much ice cream, and they're still not letting up?</i> Of course, he wasn't either, but he was awolf; having a healthy appetite was part of the package. So why...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah,</i> Hunter thought, grinning. <i>How could I have forgotten?</i> His tail wagged as he saw Kurama stick his spoon in his mouth, closing his eyes and giggle. <i>Love of sweets is damn-near wired into kids' brains...</i> Chuckling softly, he got back to his own part of the sundae; no sense in letting it go to waste...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTh time continued to tick by, the sundae continued to shrink, and the fives' bellies grew larger and larger. All the while, Hunter and Kiba's upper garments slid further and further upward, Naruto and Kurama's bellies continued to push outward, and Akamaru's belly continued to round out and push his hind legs out further apart. And yet, their pace never let up. The message was clear: they weren't stopping till the whole damn sundae was devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued tearing away at the sundae...</span></div></div>",

The four youths, merry and happy as can be as they tore into the still bountiful heaps of ice cream within the bowl, and the anthro wolf, happy to see the younger companions having such a great time as he too, continued to tearing into the delicious and frosty treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, the more and more ice cream they consumed, the larger each of their respective tummies continued to swell up.  Akamaru's tummy had distended to the point where he could feel it reaching lower and lower to the chair he stood on.  He whined to himself, knowing it was only a matter of time before he'd lose footing and be resorted to a rounded orb just like before.  But nonetheless, he'd conceded that his love for such a delicious treat superseded common sense, and in his case; dignity.  So, he saved face and just kept stuffing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's orange furred belly had filled up to the point where he could just barely see his hind paws now.  Gulping down his latest mouthful, he licked his chops and examined how large his tummy had grown, giggling as he patted it and felt it jostle and bounce.  <i>Heehee, I can't believe I've actually eaten so much...and that I'm STILL eating even more!</i> the kit mused, smiling as he did.  <i>But I can't help it!  This 'ice cream' is the tastiest thing I've ever tasted in my entire life!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit was about to grab another spoonful, but stopped as he noticed a brief look of discomfort growing over the face of his new blond friend.  \"Naruto?  Are you guys okay?\" he asked.  Naruto burped, then smiled at the young fox as he nodded assuredly.  \"Oh, yeah, everything's cool.  Just feels like my gut's gettin' a bit snagged by my pants button is all,\" he said, massaging his distended belly tenderly.  Kiba chuckled, feeling his own belly getting caught by the button of his pants.  \"Heh, y'know somethin', bonehead?  Mine too,\" he responded, earning a laugh from the (currently) elder Hunter.  \"Hehe, me three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as one, the trio shared an impish look, which Akamaru caught immediately.  <i>Ohhh great...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, on the other hand, tilted his head curiously at the peculiar display, but then Naruto chuckled and said, \"Heh, guess ya know what that means, don'tcha, guys?\"  The others nodded, but Kurama just scratched his head curiously.  \"W-what's going on?\" the kit asked.  Hunter smiled and replied, \"Weeeeell, our stomachs have all taken on quite a bit of ice cream, but sadly, those of us who have to wear clothes...or choose to, in the case of yours truly, have these buttons on our pants that keep 'em up, and remember how Naruto's stomach had to bust through all those buttons on his shirt?\"  The kit just giggled and nodded, fondly recalling that hilarious display.  \"Same thing for our pants.  These buttons are constricting 'em, and rather than unbutton and unzip to give our guts' some breathing room, these two over here prefer to make a lil game of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A game?\" piped Kurama, earning a grin from the boys as Kiba nodded and said, \"Yup!  Who can eat enough to bust their button first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Kurama's face lit up.  \"Oooh!  So more buttons are gonna start popping off and flying around the room?\"  he asked, earning a laugh from Naruto as he leaned over and playfully nudged the kits' arm.  \"You know it!  Can't very well polish this thing off if our stomachs are being held back, right?\"  Naruto then turned to his dog-nin pal and the anthro wolf.  \"Ready to lose, fellas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just scoffed and said, \"Ready to wipe that smug look right off y'er face, bonehead!\"  Hunter just laughed and said, \"Alrighty, boys, let the games begin!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the trio started digging into the ice cream rapidly, shoveling as much into their mouths as they possibly could.  All the while, Kurama watched eagerly, excited to see the show, and who would win...and of course, keep his eye on flying buttons to avoid getting pegged again.  Akamaru on the other hand, just smirked to himself and shook his head.  <i>I just hope you guys aren't gonna be embarrassed, exposing your silly looking undies...AGAIN...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled at the pups' musings and just kept watching.  There was a notable strain in the trios faces, clearly from the pressure the button was pressing against their bellies, but nonetheless, they each soldiered on, each one striving to beat the other, until finally...</span></div></div>",

In spite of this, they kept up their pace, none of the three wanting to be outdone by the other. <i>Ooh...I wonder who's button is gonna go firstt?</i> the kit wondered, digging his spoon back in and getting a big chunk of brownie<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the other three were determined to make that answer \"mine,\" and, as they felt their button threads snapping one by one, they grinned and ate even faster. More and more their tummies swelled, and more and more their threads loosened and snapped, until their buttons were quivering violently, just barely holding on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a victorious grin on each of their faces, the boys and anthro took one heaping spoonful of ice cream and toppings each, spooned them into their mouths, gulped, and as the mouthfuls reached their bellies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...three separate plastic disks, in perfect unison, burst off their waists. One dinged off the side of the sundae, only to ricochet and smack into the wall, another embedded itself directly into the sundae, and the third...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened as the third shot straight for him. <i>Yikes!</i> Desperate, he jerked his head to the side, the projectile whizzing past his head. He sat back down and sighed in relief...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...before that one ricocheted off the wall and hit him right the back of the head. \"Ow!\" he exclaimed, almost dropping his spoon and his unoccupied paw going to the back of his head to rub it. \"Wow, that really came flying off, didn't it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the other three gave Kurama an apologetic look, they sighed in relief as the pressure around their waists abated, and each of their flies tugged themselves down a few teeth. \"Oh man, that felt amazing...\" Hunter moaned, letting his tongue loll out the side of his muzzle as he rubbed his freed belly with a paw. The boys sighed in agreement, massaging their own bellies. \"Can't believe we busted our buttons at the same time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this comment, the three immediatly stopped massaging their midsections, Kurama stopped rubbing the back of his head, and even Akamaru pulled his head out of the sundae to look at the three. <i>Yyyyyyeah, not really surprised at all...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence reigned over the room for a few moments as the boys and wolf looked at each other, and the young Nine-Tails stared at the three, mouth gaping open slightly. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, grins formed over all their faces, and as one, the four burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeheehee!\" Kurama giggled, his paw moving from the back of his head to his muzzle. \"Y-you all...at the same time...\" He managed nothing else before he dissolved back into hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Naruto felt underneath his belly, grinning as he felt the missing button and the slightly-opened zipper of his cargo pants. \"Heh, guess we did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping, Kiba rubbed his stomach, even as he snorted, \"H-heh, seems that way!\" Taking a deep breath, he calmed down a bit. \"Normally, I'd be pissed, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The timing was just too good?</i> Akamaru offered, wagging his tail. By way of answer, Kiba grinned, nodded, and gave his canine pal a thumbs-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the timing really was awesome,\" Hunter agreed loudly, making sure Naruto heard. \"Wonder how we managed that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKibashrugged. \"Who cares?\" He gave his belly a hearty slap, causing it to bounce noticeably (much to Kurama's delight). \"All I know is, my gut's freed up, and I'm ready for more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. \"Took the words right outta my mouth, dog-breath!\" Hunter said nothing, but grinned and licked his chops. Nodding at each other, the three dove right back into their sundaes. Kurama, the pain having abated, beamed and continued digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a couple of minutes, as the five continued shoveling ice cream into their mouths and slowly swelling their bellies bigger (and, in the case of Naruto, Kiba, and Hunter, gradually forcing their flies down further). It was only when Kurama, his spoon halfway to his muzzle, stopped, his face contorting in a very odd-looking grimace, that the other four took notice. Swallowing his current mouthful, Naruto asked, \"Uh, Kurama? You feelin' OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gettin' sick, are ya?\" Kiba asked, his voice teasing, though Akamaru caught the note of concern in it. But Kurama shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I still wanna eat as much of this yummy sundae as I can,\" the kit affirmed, smiling. \"It's just...\" his smile faded, and his unoccupied paw wandered down to his bulbous belly, rubbing it tenderly. \"I've got this really weird...I dunno, tightness...in the middle of my tummy right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's ears perked. \"Tightness...?\" he repeated. Naruto and Kiba glanced at each other, realization slowly dawning on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama bobbed his head. \"Yuh-huh! I mean, it doesn't hurt, but it feels...weird...like there's a lotta pressure right in the center...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's eyes widened, and grins slowly spread on the boys' faces as they realized just what the kit was talking about. Akamaru, pulling his head back out, gave a surprised growl. <i>Huh, didn't even think he <b>had</b> one of those...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's large ears twitched as he heard the dog's comment, but he shook it off. \"I-Is that bad?\" the kit asked. \"Sh-should I take a break till it goes away?\" To his surprise, Naruto and Kiba turned toward him, huge smiles on both their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, that's normal,\" Naruto assured the kit. \"Completely normal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"That just means you've eaten a lot...and that, if you can get the pressure to go away, you can eat even more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, curious, tilted his head. \"How do I make it go away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled. \"Just keep eatin', kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox blinked, confused. \"But...won't that just make my tummy tighter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure will!\" Naruto replied cheerily. \"But don't worry; when the pressure finally goes away, it's totally worth it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama frowned, puzzled. If eating more would increase the pressure, how would that make it go away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Naruto was his friend; he wouldn't lie to him. So, with a shrug, he looked back at Naruto. \"Al-alright,\" the kit replied, a bit uncertainly. \"I'll-I'll just keep eating 'till the pressure goes away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the kit's reluctance, Hunter smiled warmly. \"Don't worry, kid; it's gonna be loads of fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit's ears perked, and he smiled a bit. \"...really?\" At Naruto's eager nodded, the kit grinned, licked his chops, and dug back in. The others, not to be outdone, quickly followed suit....</span></div></div>",

Feeling the tightness in his belly grow tighter and tighter, the Kyuubi would occasionally wince in discomfort, but he shook it off, and soldiered on, gulping more and more of that tasty treat down, only making the tightness amplify tenfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he felt his stomach getting tighter and tighter, that uncomfortable tightness gradually began to cause ache, making him wince more and more, a bit more visibly to the others, who caught it.  Putting his spoon down, Hunter gave the kit a calm yet slightly concerned glance, as he watched the kit almost forcing himself to eat ice cream at this point.  \"Hey, kid, are you feeling alright?\" asked the wolf.  Ears twitching at the question, Kurama glanced nervously at his (current) elder and smiled assuredly at him.  \"O-oh, y-yeah!  I'm fine!  It's just, m-my tummy still feels a...l-little tight is all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just smiled at the young creature and said, \"Don't worry, you're almost there.  Just keep at it, you're doing great!\"  Hearing this, the creature couldn't help but beam with pride, which forced him back to the ice cream.  \"...W-well, if you're sure...\" he said, hesitantly, and took one more hearty mouthful and gulped it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as that mouthful of ice cream slid down his throat and into his belly however, it just became too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after, Kurama jerked back, yipping in pain as he did, catching the ears of the others, and shortly after, began whining as he gripped his belly with both paws.  \"H-hey, what's wrong, Kurama?\" asked Kiba, more notably concerned than last time.  Unfortunately, the dog-nin's question was answered with more whimpering from the young fox as he finally replied.  \"Owww...m-my tummy...really hurts right now...c-can I take a break, please...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's head immediately nodded yes.  \"Y-yeah, of course!\" replied the wolf, inwardly kicking himself for not remembering that; unlike the others, young Kurama had never eaten this much before, so he wouldn't have been used to how tight his middle could feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, the kit stepped aside from the massive bowl and sat on the ground, tenderly rubbing his belly with both tries, trying ever so desperately to make the tight, now painfully constricting sensation go away,  but all to no avail.  Then, much to everyone's alarm, they began to hear sniffles emitting from the kit, almost like before.  <i>Oh no...</i> whined Akamaru, much to the concern of Kiba, seeing Kurama turn his head away from the others, and seeing his body jerk slightly with each sniffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Naruto immediately stepped away from the bowl, hoisting his bloated and exposed belly with one hand as he made his way to the kit and sat beside him, glancing at him apologetically, despite the fact that the kit's back was still turned towards him.  \"I'm so sorry, Kurama, I-I shouldn't 'uh told you to push on without explaining what was going on first.  Does it really hurt that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, to the boys surprise, the kit shook his head.  \"N-no, it's not that...\" he replied.  Then, much to Naruto's alarm, the kit's eyes clenched shut and a few tears trickled down his orange furred cheeks.  \"It's just...y-you guys have all been so nice to me.  You cheered me up when I was sad...then you helped me get out of that scary cage for a little while...showed me all those neat masks...a-and you all even shared the yummiest treat I've ever tasted with me!  A-and even when getting rid of this tightness is supposed to be fun...here I am, spoiling that fun like a-always...cause I'm...just a big, stupid baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widened, Naruto got up and sat directly in front of the kit as he said, with a greater sense of certainty in his voice, \"What?!  No you're not!  Hey, look at me.\"  Still sniffing, the kit wiped his eyes with his forearm, and eventually complied as he lifted his low head just slightly and glanced at the boy, eyes still glossy.  \"You haven't spoiled anything, you hear me?  Heck, hanging around you's been a freakin' blast!\"  Despite himself, Akamaru chuckled, recalling the Blast Mask incident.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Literally.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Kiba snickered and piped in.  \"Yeah, you ain't no downer!  Remember how stupid the bonehead looked with all those masks on?  Cause I remember you busting your gut right alongside me!\"  Despite an initial scowl from the remark, Naruto nonetheless nodded in agreement.  \"Not only that, but you're really funny, thoughtful, cheery...heck, you're downright sweet!  Trust me, if anyone's grateful to be hanging out right now, it's me.  Cause you ain't spoilin' nobodies fun.  You're bringing it to life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit's previously lowered gaze widened a bit as he looked up at the boy once again.  \"...Y-you mean it...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Kurama's surprise, the boy laughed and ruffled the top of the kit's head playfully.  \"Course I do, silly!\"  Hunter chuckled and added, \"Hey, has the kid steered you wrong, so far?\"  This earned a snicker from Kiba as he added, \"Naruto ain't clever enough to lie.  THAT requires a functioning brain!\"  Glaring back at Kiba, Naruto grinned then smugly replied, \"Hey, cut me some slack, dog-breath.  If I couldn't lie, I'd have told ya how much better your face would look with that scent mask on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken back, Kiba tried to retort, but couldn't think of anything on the spot, earning snickers from both Akamaru and Hunter.  \"Kiba, I believe I have some ointment in my bag for that B-U-R-N,\" said Hunter, causing Kiba to grumble in annoyance and fold his arms together.  \"Ah shaddup...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching this exchange, Kurama couldn't help but laugh a little himself, much to Naruto's relief, but the kit still winced and clutched his belly with both paws.  \"Still hurts?\" the blonde asked, earning a slight nod from the kit.  Akamaru tilted his head and pondered to himself for a moment.  <i>Maybe Kurama just needs to burp.  That tends to make pressure in your belly go away, right?</i>  He was about to tell the kit himself, but stopped before he could open his little muzzle.  <i>A-actually, on second thought...if his belly was that loud just from hunger...I'm...pretty quite sure we're not gonna wanna hear how much louder it'd be coming outta his muzzle...</i> he thought, shuddering at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to the pup's internal musings, (like his external musings) Naruto pondered for a moment, as Kurama glanced up at the boy apologetically.  \"I'm sorry...I know this part's supposed to be fun, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're ya sorry for?  Getting a tummyache?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the kit's surprise, the boy laughed.  \"You ain't used to eatin' this much the way we are.  You got nothing to be ashamed about.  Heck, if anything, you should be proud!\"  To this, the kit tilted his head curiously.  \"Proud...?\"  he inquired, earning an enthusiastic nod from Naruto.  \"You bet!  For a first timer?  The fact that you've even managed to eat THIS much...is awesome!\" the boy replied, playfully but very gently poking the kits' bulbous tummy, causing him to giggle a bit, despite himself.  \"In fact, first time I ever went nuts with food, I don't even I ate this much...and trust me, even then, I had the WORST bellyache of my life after that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled and nodded in agreement.  \"Same here.  I might be a wolf, but first time I gorged myself, I didn't get anywhere near as far as you did, and I was whining WAAAY more as a result.\"  The wolf piped in, earning Kiba's attention as he rubbed the back of his head sheepishly.  \"Yeaaaah, same here...and same with Akamaru over here.\"  Hearing that, the pup blushed a bit beneath his fur, but nodded, acknowledging the fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then glanced at the kit and smiled widely as he said, \"So don't be ashamed if you can't get it all in one go.  That you've managed to keep up such a great pace so far is incredible, ESPECIALLY for a first timer, cause you got all of us beat so far on that front.  And TRUST me, you ain't being a downer,\" with this, Naruto's smile grew warm and his voice sounded a bit more thoughtful, \"because I couldn't be more glad to be hangin' out with you, Kurama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit simply didn't know what to say.  Even back with the others, he'd never heard (or at least remembered hearing) anyone else say such kind things to him.  He simply sat there, processing it all, as though making sure he'd actually heard what he had heard.  And when it all clicked to him, in a momentary lapse of judgement, the creature wrapped his arms around the boy, much to everyone's temporary alarm, but that alarm subsided when they saw the kit embracing a stunned Naruto.  \"...Thank you...\" the kit said, tearing up with...gratitude, leaving the others still fairly stunned alongside Naruto.  But eventually, the boy worked a smile and patted the kit on the back.  \"Hey, what're friends for, right...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked and shook his head.  \"Sap...\" he said playfully, but Akamaru could hear respect in his voice, and just wagged his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, again, Hunter felt his heart melting.  The sight was positively adorable and somewhat humorous, seeing the kit lean forward, working around both his and Naruto's more than bloated midsections to hug the blonde, but also a mixture of heart warming, seeing how grateful the kit had been towards Naruto...and in the back of his head...heart breaking, since he; like the others, knew eventually, this bond wouldn't last.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he forced himself to shake that thought off, as Naruto pulled back and nudged the kit's arm playfully.  \"Don't worry.  Soon as you feel up to it, jump back.  No rush, okay?\"  Naruto said.  The kit nodded, smiling as he wiped his face clean.  Then, the kit asked, \"...W-will eating more really make the tightness go away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just smiled back and gave the kit a wink.  \"Heh, trust me, it'll <i>pop</i> right outta ya....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the boy headed back to the bowl, leaving the kit to ponder, until finally...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto made his way back over to his corner of the bowl, picking his spoon back up. All the while, he kept an eye on Kurama, who was looking downward even as he drummed his furry orange belly, seemingly deep in thought. <i>Man...I hope he doesn't force himself, 'cause it seemed like he was really hurtin' earlier....</i> Grimacing, he dug his spoon back in, eating at a noticeably slower pace than before, joining the others, who were eating at a similar pace. However, this was less due to them getting full (though they were beginning to feel just how much they had packed in their bellies) and more due to the fact that they were all keeping an eye on the kit. Like Naruto, they werer all hoping he'd take his time, so as not to actually make himself sick. Heck, some of them were wondering if it wouldn't be better for him to just stop now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they were all quite surprised when Kurama, with a determined glint in his eyes, struggled to his paws (giggling a bit as he noticed his belly touching the floor, barely allowing him any traction), made his way back over to the dish, and settled himself into the same upright sitting position as before. \"K-Kurama?\" Naruto asked, licking his lips clean of some whipped cream. Grinning at the blonde, Kurama grabbed his spoon and dug it in. \"Kurama, you know if you're not ready, ya don't hafta...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Kurama piped,withdrawing the spoon to reveal a heaping spoonful of ice cream, toppings, and sauce. \"But if gettin' rid of the pressure's as fun as you say it is, then I want in, too!\" Giggling, the kit stuck the spoon in his muzzle, gulping it down and wincing as his belly became a little tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the other four's eyes widened in worry, and Hunter raised a paw. \"K-kid, seriously,\" the wolf started, \"If you think you're gonna make yourself sick, you really don't have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I wanna!\" the young Kyubi replied, digging his spoon back in, even as he winced at the increased tightness in his tummy. \"Yeah, i-it kinda hurts...\" he stuck the spoon in, wincing as he gulped the mouthful down. \"....b-but I'm not worried.\" At this, he looked toward Naruto and smiled warmly. \"Not when I got the bestest friends I've ever had behind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in Naruto's chest hitched at that comment, and how utterly <i>sincere</i> it sounded, but he managed to laugh and rub the back of his head. \"Aww, you're not too bad yourself, Kurama!\" Kiba, for his part, scoffed and folded his arms, but he wasn't quite able to hide the smile tugging at the edges of his mouth. Akamaru, not nearly so reserved, wagged his tail eagerly. And Hunter... Well, the wolf was barely able to keep his balance, what with his heart turning to mush and all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to this, Naruto beamed and gave Kurama a thumbs up. \"In that case, go right ahead!\" He winked at the kit. \"I know you can do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling at the praise, Kurama dug his spoon back in, gulped it down, winced...then went back in, a little quicker than before. Scoop, swallow, gulp, wince, repeat...with each repetition, he winced a little quicker, scooped a little faster, gulped a little more eagerly, even as his tummy grew tighter and tighter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama winced as the tightness reached near-unbearable levels. \"Nnngh...\" the kit grunted, wrapping one arm around as much of his belly as he could. \"My tummy...feels so tight...\" He whimpered a bit. \"F-feels like I'm gonna explode...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grimaced, concern for his new friend evident in his face, but he shook his head. \"C'mon, Kurama, don't give up now! You're almost there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, c'mon!\" Kiba urged. \"You really gonna lie down and give up now?\" Despite the harsh words, Akamaru wagged his tail as he heard the genuine encouragement in his voice. Then, turning to Kurama, he barked, <i>C'mon, Kurama! You can do it! Just a little more...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, kiddo!\" Hunter called. \"You're tough, I know you can do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his new friends kept calling out encouragement to him, Kurama grunted, slowly sitting back up. They were right; he couldn't give up now, especially when they had so much faith in him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, slowly removing his arm from his belly, Kurama jammed his spoon into the sundae, withdrew the biggest spoonful any of them had ever seen, opened his mouth wide, and jammed it in. The chilled trea still in his mouth, he whimpered again as he felt the near-crushing tightness of his belly, but he took a deep breath through his nose, gulped it down, and winced. And, as it plopped down into his already-overfilled belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>POP</b>!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Kurama's eyes flew wide open as he felt an explosive release of pressure from the center of his belly, the sheer force of it causing him to stagger and knocking him back on his rump. \"OOF!\" he yelped as he fell flat on his bottom. Wincing, he reached his forearms back to massage his rump...but stopped when he realized something. \"Hey...\" he started, the sides of his muzzle slowly quirking upwards. \"That...that actually felt really good!\" Giggling, he rested his arms on the floor behind him. \"I mean, it was like, there was all this pressure, then WHOOSH! It was all gone!\" Now full-on grinning, he rested a paw on top of his orange belly. \"Not just that, but my tummy doesn't feel tight at all any more! I feel like I could eat way more!\" Beaming, he looked up at his four friends...but faltered as he saw the looks of shock on their faces; Akamaru and Hunter's muzzles were even hanging open a bit. \"G-guys? I-is everything OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering, Naruto slowly raised a finger, pointing directly at the middle of the kit's overstuffed belly. \"M-my tummy?\" he asked curiously. Naruto simply nodded in response. Curious, Kurama ran a paw down his tummy. \"What about my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened as his hands brushed against something. \"Huh? What the...\" Lifting his paw from the obstruction, he looked down at his belly...and his muzzle promptly dropped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, smack-dab in the middle of his belly-in fact, where the pressure had been concentrated-a large-orange furred nub of flesh stuck out for everyone to see. Curious, Kurama shifted to get a better view, but the protuberance wobbled slightly as he did so. \"Is...is that my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, though he still stared at it, began smiling as he nodded. \"Yep; sure is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this confirmation, Kurama reached a digit out to his inverted navel (which, Hunter noticed a bit incredulously, was about twice the size of Naruto and Kiba's-and that was when they'd been at their proper ages), wiggled it a bit...and his muzzle immediately lifted in a toothy grin. \"Heehee! That feels funny!\" Pressing his digit a bit more firmly into the protuberance, he wiggled it and wiggled it, giggling at the strange sensations it produced. \"It-it's ticklish, but it's also tingly...\" Beaming, he wiggled harder, giggling as the tingly/ticklish feeling spread throughout his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the kit's obvious enjoyment, Naruto's smile widened into a full-on grin. \"Heh; told ya.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stared incredulously at the sight. <i>Didn't even know he <b>had</b> a belly-button...</i> the young dog-nin thought idly. Akamaru, staring at the sight, simply shook his head, even as his tail wagged. And Hunter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Hunter's eye began twitching. He took in the young, overstuffed Tailed Beast, his popped-out navel, the look of sheer and utter <i>glee</i> on his face as he played with it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn...cuteness...levels...overwhelming...</i> the anthro thought to himself. <i>Must...keep...heart...going...</i> At this, he slowly pounded on his chest a few times to keep his heart beating. Once he was satisfied his heart wasn't going to stop from sheer, unadulterated adorableness, Hunter settled down, smiling at just how <i>happy</i> the young creature looked. <i>Yep,</i> he thought, tail wagging as the young fox laughed joyously. <i>Totally worth it....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so had passed...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All the while, as Hunter watched, he once again found himself looking away and wincing as he smacked his chest a few times.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hnnnng....not....fair....too...cute....ngh...must....not....succumb...{/i } the wolf thought, earning an odd stare from Akamaru.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You feeling alright there, wolfy?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hunter just nodded, after once again forcing himself not to suffer a cuteness overload and...'go offline' as it were.  Eventually, he sighed and shook himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, the kit was now standing alongside his new friends surrounding the massive bowl now only somewhat filled with what was once a hike of ice cream.  Seeing the kit back to his cheery self, Naruto smiled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, feelin' better, buddy?\" asked Naruto, a bit surprised to hear himself just blurt out the word to Kurama, but stifled the doubt and held onto the notion.  Kurama simply bobbed his head eagerly as he beamed gleefully at the boy.  \"Heehee, you betcha!  All that pressure popping outta my tummy at once freed up a LOTTA room, cause now, there's no more tightness!\"  Naruto just laughed and gave the kit a thumbs up.  \"Glad to hear it, cause we're getting close to the finish line here, and something tells me that we're gonna need your help to beat this thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit smiled back and grabbed his spoon.  \"Well, then what're we waiting for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the others, both Kiba and Hunter grabbed their respective spoons while Akamaru; after some doing, managed to get into position as he leaned downward to stick his head back into the bowl.  \"Well, boys, before we banish this oh-so-delicious beast amongst beasts to the fullest of bellies, let's all take a moment to appreciate what we've accomplished here.\" said Hunter, earning curious gazes from all four other youths.  Smiling, he held his one free hand over the massive bowl.  \"Never before have any creatures been fool hardy enough to take on such a tremendous foe!\"  He took his other hand and patted his immensely bloated brown furred belly proudly and added, \"Never before had any creature the stomachs to contain so massive a treat!  Well, to any nay sayers, I say look around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then pointed towards the four youths, each of whom look down at their bulbous bellies, then at each other, smiling proudly as they did.  \"We have not one; but FIVE dare devils with the stomachs to take on so vicious a beast and the will not to be overwhelmed!  Take pride in knowing you have all undertaken a frosty foe no one before you has ever defeated!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled to himself.  \"But ice cream isn't a foe!  It's yummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others snickered to themselves as Hunter, a bit caught off guard, chuckled and said, \"No, a foe as in, an obstacle of will and-ah forget it.\"  With that, he grabbed his spoon held it high and gestured for the others to do the same.  \"Well, boys?  Bon appetit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those last words, all five dug their spoons (or in Akamaru's case, face) right into the ample but low remains of ice cream.  The boys and canines filled with vigor and joy as they stuffed as much of the frosty treat into their eager mouths as they could possibly fit.  Slow enough to savor the flavor of each bite, but fast enough for the pile left in the massive bowl to noticeably begin to dwindle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more and more time went on, Akamaru found himself struggling to get a bite, between his small size, his massive rounded tummy and the even more grand bowl, he simply couldn't reach his little head down to the corner of ice cream reserved for him.  Spotting this, Kiba chuckled to himself.  \"Having trouble, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Akamaru could ask for help, Kiba stopped for a moment and headed towards the empty gallons, grabbing as many as he could fit into his arms and; one by one, scooping up what was left of Akamaru's chocolate-free section of the bowl into the many gallons and setting them aside for the pup.  Barking happily, Akamaru licked the boy's hand gratefully, and after Kiba had picked him up; with some doing, the pup...rolled towards the three gallons he had left, and proceeded to dig his face with no struggle, but not before sighing to himself.  <i>Great, I'm a bowling ball...and we haven't even finished yet...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, despite Akamaru's embarrassment to the notion, giggled happily and said, \"Heehee, but isn't rolling around like that fun?  Cause it sure looks fun!\"  Akamaru turned towards the kit and pondered for a moment.  <i>Well...it certainly beats trying to WALK with a gut this bloated, heh...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit more at piece with his tummy's current size...if only slightly, the pup dug his head back into the first gallon and went to town, while the others continued doing the same with the bowl...slowly but surely diminishing the contents remaining in the bowl...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The five, even Kurama, were beginning to feel just how much ice cream they had packed in their bellies, but they pressed on as fast as ever, not wanting to give up this close to the finish line. They spooned mouthful after mouthful into their waiting maws, internally delighting at the fact they were <i>still</i> experiencing new flavors at this late stage in the game. And so, the sundae slowly diminished further and further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Kiba's tank top and hoodie, respectively, were now resting completely on top of their engorged midsections, which continued to bulge as more and more ice cream was spooned in. Kiba's hoodie stayed put as the boy shoveled more and more in, but Hunter's shirt, not made of such durable fabric, began straining noticeably at the seams. Not taking notice, Hunter continued on, savoring the flavor of the monstrosity they'd constructed, causing his seams to strain more and more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's belly continued bulging further and further outward, past his busted-open shirt. Noticing this, Naruto smacked it with a hand, giggling as it bounced noticeably, even as he continued spooning ice cream in with the other hand. As his belly stopped bouncing, he looked across the dish at Kurama and smiled warmly. The kit was gleefully spooning ice cream into his muzzle, his earlier pain and discomfort nowhere to be found. Like Naruto, he was holding his spoon with one paw while the other one played with his belly; in this case, wiggling his inverted navel, causing him to giggle even as he took spoonful after spoonful into his waiting mouth. <i>Awww...he looks so happy now...</i> Giggling himself, Naruto dug his spoon back in, digging in with even greater fervor. <i>Don't blame 'im, though; all that pressure popping out at once feels amazing...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smallest member of the group scarfed his ice cream down with vigor, wincing as he felt his already bowling-ball-sized tummy bulge bigger and bigger, gradually lifting his paws even further off the chair. <i>Eeyup; definitely gonna look like a beach ball by the time I'm done...</i> the pup lamented, even as he dug his head back into the gallons of ice cream. Damn it, this was too freaking good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more they ate, and more and more the sundae and gallons diminished, and, of course, the bigger and bigger their tummies swelled. Eventually, the seams of Hunter's tanktop below his armpit popped, splitting apart and leaving only the seams from the armpit up intact. Hunter's eyes widened as he realized what had happened, but realized the action had released some pressure, and dug back in. In addition, the three of them that were wearing pants or shorts, their flies already forced all the way open, were feeling rather tight. Indeed, as they neared the end, they heard (and felt) them ripping a bit in the front. They blushed, but continued on. Kurama, oblivious, continued to stuff his face, his belly now completely concealing his hind paws, his navel wobbling as he rubbed his tummy. And Akamaru's belly continued to grow bigger and rounder, lifting him higher and higher above the chair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, four spoons clattered into the the now entirely-picked clean sundae dish, and those who had been holding them groaned, clutched their bellies, and flopped onto their backs, their oversized tummies sticking into the air. \"Oh man,\" Naruto moaned, massaging his globular tummy with both hands. \"I don't think I've ever eatURP!...eaten that much ice cream in my entire life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-me either,\" Kiba mumbled, licking his lips. \"B-but that was still the single best ice cream sundae I've ever had...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up to the top of his furry belly, Kurama wiggled his navel idly. \"It's the only one I've ever had...\" He burped suddenly, blushing slightly. \"...but it was really, really, yummy...\" he giggled somewhat sluggishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sighed, massaging his own tummy with both paws. \"You said it, kiddo...\" Suddenly, he burped, but rather than be embarrassed, he simply smiled and licked his chops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, licking his own muzzle, whined as he looked down at himself. <i>YEah, it was yummy...but look at our guts...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, their consumption of such a massive treat had left their bellies truly massive. Hunter, the boys, and Kurama each looked as though they had a fleshy or fur-covered beach ball of at least medium size attached to their midsections (curiously, with the exception of Kurama, all their navels were still innies). Akamaru, true to his prediction, now looked like a small, furry beach ball, his paws now several inches above the chair....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Taking the hint, Naruto forced himself to sit upright. Burping wetly, he glanced at the fox and grinned. \"This whole day's been fun, and it's all...\" Then, to the fox's surprise, Naruto threw an arm about the fox's shoulders and pulled him close. \"...thanks to you, buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smiled, touched. \"Aww...you're fun too, Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, having forced himself into a sitting position as well, smiled as he looked over his belly at the two youths. <i>They've become such good friends in such a short time,</i> Hunter lamented. <i>If only there was a way to...</i> His eyes suddenly widened. <i>Ah! That's it!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, boys,\" Hunter started, smiling at Naruto and Kurama. \"I know we're gonna have to rest these off before we do anything else, but how would you like to play later on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Play?!\" Kurama's ears shot up, and he looked right back at Hunter, grinning. \"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting, Kiba sat up, resting both hands on his belly. \"What? What happened to not letting him go out in public?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru was about to bark his agreement when, without warning, he felt himself rolling....toward the edge of the chair. His eyes bulged open. <i>No...</i> frantically, he kicked his paws as hard as he could, but to no avail. <i>Nonononononono!</i>  Kiba, eyes turning toward his canine pal, gasped. \"Akamaru!\" Forcing himself up off his feet, he lurched as quickly as he could toward the pup, belly wobbling all the while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crap!</i> Akamaru yelped as he rolled closer to the edge. <i>This is gonna hurt, I know it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, just as he was about to topple off the edge of the chair, Kiba seized the beach-ball-sized pup, bringing him to his chest and resting him on top of his fully-exposed belly. The boy smiled. \"I gotcha, boy.\" Akamaru, breathing a sigh of relief, gratefuly licked Kiba's face, causing the boy to giggle even as he plopped back on his rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled uproariously at the sight, and Naruto wasn't much further behind. Snickering himself, Hunter nonetheless continued. \"Yeah, we agreed not to bring him out in public...\" the edge of his muzzle quirked up. \"...here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quirked an eyebrow. \"Eh? What are ya talkin' about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned, getting to his hind paws and lurching over to his bag. \"Well,\" he began, rummaging through it. \"I was thinking: I have those Kaepora Gaebora statues all over the place, including the place where they came from, Termina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blinked. \"Wh-whaddaya mean?\" he asked curiously, even as realization slowly formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked back at the overstuffed kit, grinning. \"Well,\" the anthro replied, withdrawing from his bag with several small objects in his hand. \"It's a pretty fun place; kinda mischievous, but its cool, and there's lots of stuff to do, not to mention a lot of wide-open spaces to run around in...\" He chuckled. \"...not to mention the Keatons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama tiled his head. \"Keatons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded. \"Yep! They're a race of three-tailed foxes that live there. Not only are they fairly common, but they're well-regarded by the populace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the kit's face lit up. \"You mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Hunter replied, nodding. He sat down on his rump and scooted closer to the youths, objects still in hand. \"You'd fit in great, and you could go out in public and play. But to play...\" smiling, he held the objects closer, and Kurama noticed they appeared to be small vials with green liquid inside it. \"...you're gonna hafta digest first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the formula, Naruto, Kiba, and Akamaru's eyes widened, but Hunter continued before they could interject. \"These little fellas here help you digest; just down one of these, and by the time you wake up, you'll be ready and raring to go.\" He handed one to the eager fox kit, then to Naruto, Kiba, and Akamaru. \"I'd take one myself, but I think I'll digest just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled. \"Thanks, Mr. Hunter!\" Pulling the cork off, he downed the whole thing, smacking his lips. \"Huh, kinda tastes funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro merely shrugged. \"Funny's better than bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba gave the wolf odd looks, but they nonetheless downed theirs, giving some to Akamaru as well. Once that was done, Hunter cleared his throat. \"Now, the way I figured it, we'd nap, rest these off, change into some clothes that AREN'T ripped, and head straight off.\" He smiled at the youths. \"That OK with you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smiled, his eyes starting to droop. \"Sounds great!\" <i>And maybe I can try some on, too...</i> He yawned widely, smacking his lips. It must have been contagious, because Naruto suddenly yawned as well, followed by Kiba and his canine companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChest warming at the sight, Hunter yawned himself. \"Sounds like a grand idea, boys.\" He looked out the window, his eyes widening. \"Oh wow, night already?\" Looking back, he started speaking. \"Well, at least we'll get up bright and...\" The anthro trailed off...and a smile slowly tugged across his muzzle at the sight that met his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time he'd looked out the window, the youths had all nodded off. Kiba was flat on his back, arms splayd out to the sides, his tummy rising and falling as he breathed. Akamaru, having rolled off his chest, was lying beside his head, his legs kicking a bit in his sleep. Naruto and Kurama were leaning against each other, the blonde's arm still wrapped about the kit's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aww,</i> the anthro cooed inwardly. <i>They sure look content...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Kurama reached a foreleg to the side, grabbed his tails, opened his mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's eyes bulged wide. <i>He's not gonna...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and closed his mouth around his tails. After a few seconds, the tails began shifting a bit, indicating that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh dear sweet Arceus, he's sucking on his tails,</i> Hunter thought, the sheer cuteness of the sight overwhelming him a bit. <i>K-keep it together, Hunter; you're a wolf, an apex predator, the cream of the...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as that last thought entered his head, Kurama reached up with his other arm, wrapped it around Naruto's shoulders, and tugged the boy closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...nighty night.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes crossing, Hunter flopped onto his back, and soon, he was snoring, sleeping off the massive meal with the rest of them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hours ticked away, and night soon turned to day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours had passed since last nights massive ice cream sundae escapades, and since then, the previously bulbous bellies attached to all five parties had shrunken right back down to their regularly thin forms.  Naruto, still wearing his busted shirt, now just exposing his once again thinned chest and stomach, slowly groaned as his eyes fluttered open.  Sure enough, he woke to find an orange furred arm rested around his shoulders brotherly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his head, he smiled warmly to see Kurama; one arm wrapped around Naruto, and the other...holding his tails as he innocently sucked on the top like a baby to a thumb.  Normally, Naruto would be cracking up at such a sight.  If ever he caught <i>Kiba</i> doing such a thing, he'd probably never stop laughing for as long as he lived.  However, what Naruto was focusing on was the arm wrapped around his shoulders like that of a truly close companion, and; behind the tail sucking, a warm smile across the young kits muzzle.  Even in this state, Naruto couldn't help but smile an equally warm smile at the young creature; content and peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscovering his own arm wrapped around the kit as well, Naruto playfully and gently rocked the kit, until he saw the orange creatures' eyes flutter open.  Grinning, he patted Kurama on the arm.  \"Mornin', buddy!\"  exclaimed Naruto, catching the creature off guard for a second, before he smiled and 'said', \"MRNI-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widening, Kurama looked down to see his tails in his mouth, and immediately spat them out, chuckling as he rubbed the back of his head sheepishly.  \"Eehehee...m-mornin', Naruto...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the blond just laughed and waved his hand dismissively.  \"Heehee, don't worry, Kurama.  I sometimes do that in my sleep too!\"  replied Naruto, earning a curious glance from the kit as he tilted his head.  \"You sometimes suck your tails?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, no, my thumb.  Y'know, like a baby or somethin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the kit and boy laughed to themselves before Kurama yawned heartily and stretched back, rubbed his eyes with his foreleg.  \"Boy oh boy, I've never slept that good in my life!\" the kit exclaimed, earning a chuckle from Naruto.  \"Yeah, that's cause you've never eaten that much before either,\" the boy said, playfully poking Kurama's once again thin tummy, causing the kit to giggle as he rested a paw against his stomach and nodded.  \"You sure got me there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama felt around the lower middle of his orange furred belly, feeling his once again inward navel hidden beneath his fur.  <i>Ah shoot, guess that ticklish tingly feeling's gone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around and seeing the others still asleep and snoring audibly; Hunter especially, the two youths snickered to themselves as Kurama glanced at the window a bit more fondly and asked, \"So...ya really think these people in this...Termina place're gonna be okay with me...being outside...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled and stepped towards the kit, patting his shoulder assuredly.  \"Ya heard what Hunter said.  They actually adore Tailed Foxes there!  I think you'll be juuuuust fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then glanced over at Kiba; smile widening to a more impish state.  \"Say, Kurama...wanna see something funny?\"  The kit's head immediately bobbed up and down as Naruto slowly snuck over to Hunter's bag and reached in as quietly as he could, carefully pulling out a large white feather.  \"What's that for?\" asked the kit; hushed when he saw Naruto being all sneaky.  To which, the boy snickered quietly; approaching Kiba...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You'll see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Kiba's exposed tummy; once again thinned having digested his ample amounts of consumed ice cream, Naruto slowly brought the feather down around the young dog-nin's navel and began flicking the feather about.  In his sleep, Kiba began squirming and giggling, much to Kurama's amusement, before the boy woke up and began squirming a bit more rapidly.  \"Ahhhhahaha, w-what the heeahahahahaha!\" was all Kiba could get out, quickly waking Akamaru in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama began laughing merrily as Kiba tried swiping the feather from Naruto's hands.  \"Rise and shine, dog-breathe!\" replied Naruto, still grinning before discovering his feather immediately missing from his hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly turned to see Akamaru sitting with the feather now in his mouth.  The blond scratched his head curiously.  \"H-how did you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru just snickered, tail wagging as he did.  <i>I think you've got more important things to worry about...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to the pup's musings, Naruto was about to ask Kurama what Akamaru said, but was promptly pounced on by Kiba, causing the two to wrestle about on the floor.  \"This'll teach you, ya jerk!\" spouted Kiba amidst the struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama watched for a moment, a bit concerned at first, but as the boys started laughing, he too, found himself easing up and laughing alongside them.  \"Heehee, are they always this crazy?\" the kit asked the pup, who simply nodded and smirked to himself; feather still clamped between his jaws.  <i>All.  The.  Time.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more brief roughhousing, the two rolled off each other and found themselves on their backs, panting and laughing weakly.  \"Heh...that was...still funny...\" muttered Naruto; still catching his breath.  \"Uh-huh, and I...still whooped...your butt...bone...head...\" replied Kiba, before the two eventually rose to their feet and turned back to Hunter...who was STILL snoring, sprawled onto the ground like a poor soul who had passed out from a cuteness overload of sorts.  \"Wow, Hunter's a heavier sleeper than I thought,\" muttered Kiba, as the others nodded in agreement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand rested atop his exposed tummy, Naruto chuckled a bit sheepishly himself and said, \"Say, whadduya say we change into stuff that's NOT completely busted up?  I think Hunter's still got some spare attires from his...Midna friend...err...something, in the closet.\"  Kiba blushed a bit, remembering he'd busted his zipper and pants in the process of last nights' ultra chilly gorging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the two youths marched over to the closet, digging around and clutching onto their lower garments to keep them from plopping off and again; exposing embarrassing boxer patterns.  \"Aha!\" exclaimed the two in unison as they both pulled out a new pair of digs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Naruto headed into the bathroom to change while Kiba, Kurama and Akamaru chatted idly.  In no time at all, the blonde had returned, now wearing a blue T-shirt under a sleeveless orange hoodie and black pants.  Kiba then headed into the bathroom himself, then returned wearing a tan long-sleeved V-Neck shirt, black shorts and still wearing his necklace from his last attire.  \"Pretty damn snazzy,\" remarked Naruto.  \"Thanks, bonehead, you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smiled at the sight, then, fiddled his front paws together as though working up the courage to ask something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-say, guys...this might sound crazy, but....d-do ya think...m-maybe I could...I dunno...try something on too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys shared a confused glance for a moment.  \"What, ya mean like, put on clothes?\" asked Kiba, earning a nervous nod from the kit.  Naruto just smiled and said, \"Hey, if Hunter can do it, I don't think he'll mind you giving it a shot!\"  The kit beamed then eagerly trotted over to the closet, rummaging himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!  This one looks so cool!\" Kurama remarked, much to both boys and the pups interest as they awaited what he'd reveal.  Sure enough, the young fox pulled out a tan t-shirt with an orange flame swirl in the middle, and a pair of blue pants.  Kiba immediately turned to Naruto.  \"I-isn't that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" the blonde replied, a bit surprised himself.  Nevertheless, he worked up a smile and said, \"Well, go ahead and try it on!\"  The kit smiled joyously as he immediately slipped the shirt on, and; surprisingly, the pants, despite his tails still sticking out the backside and waving about.  He then sat upright and held his arms out.  \"So, whadduya guys think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scratched his head for a moment.  \"Heh, well, ya look pretty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty damn cool!\" blurted Naruto, smiling widely as he gave the kit a thumbs up, causing him to smile ever more gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure do, kiddo,\" replied another voice, surprising the four youths as they turned to see Hunter yawning and rubbing his eyes before placing his glaces back atop his muzzle.  \"Mmph, nice to see you boys up and about.  Heh, guess you're all pretty excited for our 'trip', huh?\"  In unison, all four nodded, causing the anthro to chuckle; albeit groggily.  \"Right on.  Here, lemme get changed and we'll get this show on the road, sound good?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the eager nods from the boys, Hunter clambered to his hind paws, gripping his shorts so they didn't fall off. Yawning, he made his way over to his duffel and rooted around for a few seconds. \"Let's see...what should I wear...\" he began tossing clothes out of the bag, sending them flying through the air. \"No, no, no...AH!\" With a cry of triumph, Hunter reached into the bag and pulled out a set of folded clothes. Holding them up, he smiled. <i>Hmm...not the sort of thing I usually wear, but this isn't the usual sort of situation, either...</i> Standing up (and making sure to keep one paw gripping his shorts), he brought the clothes over to the bed and set them down. Then, with an impish grin on his muzzle, he peeled his shirt off right there and tossed it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\" Naruto exclaimed, flushing. \"Damn it, Hunter, not again!\" Kurama glanced over at him, more than a bit confused, but decided he'd ask Naruto later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can't you go into the bathroom or something?!\" Kiba exclaimed, covering his eyes. \"We don't wanna see you streaking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled. \"Relax, Kiba; it's not like I'm changing my underwear or anything. Besides,\" he added, pulling his shorts down and kicking them off (and revealing his black, full-moon patterned boxers in the process,) \"even if I was, it's not like you'd see anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama giggled. \"Yeah, 'cause the fur covers everything, right?\" Hunter nodded, smiling at the kit. \"Got it in one, kiddo; kinda like with you...though I must admit, you look rather snazzy in that getup.\" As the fox kit beamed and rubbed the back of his head, Hunter grabbed the pants from the pile and unfolded them, revealing them to be, to the boys' and Akamaru's surprise, a pair of long, tan khaki pants. Nodding, he began pulling them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru raised an eyebrow. <i>Huh, and here I was expecting another shorts-and-tanktop outfit...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, even as he buttoned and zipped up, shrugged. \"Eh, little change every now and then never hurt anybody.\" Reaching back toward the neatly-folded pile, he pulled out a black belt, which he proceeded to loop around his waist and buckle. After making sure it wasn't too tight or too loose, he grabbed the next garment off the bed, which was a long-sleeved, bright white shirt, and slipped it over his head. After making sure it was all straightened out, Hunter smirked. \"And now, for the finishing touch...\" Reaching over to the bed, he grabbed the last garment that lay upon it- a dark green, sleeveless vest- and proceeded to slip it over his shoulders, leaving it open to reveal the white shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at himself with a satisfied nod, he looked toward the others. \"Well, boys? How do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. \"Wow...that...that actually looks sorta cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled, rubbing the back of his head. \"Aw, thanks you're too...\" Aburptly, the smile fell from his muzzle. \"Wait. What did you mean 'actually?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, sensing an opportunity, smirked, folding his arms. \"Weeeell, no offense,\" the dog-nin began, \"but tank tops and shorts? Kinda plain, if ya ask me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter spluttered a bit. \"H-hey! Tank tops and shorts are perfectly functional garments, and beside, they look badass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto snickered. \"Badass, right...\" Kiba, predictably, couldn't resist snickering alongside him. \"H-hey, knock it off!\" Hunter protested, a little offended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama looked at the two boys in confusion, then at Hunter. \"I thought you looked cool,\" Kurama admitted. At this, Hunter smiled, and Naruto and Kiba immediately stopped snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kurama!\" Naruto exclaimed, looking toward the young fox. \"You're supposed to be on my side!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am on your side,\" Kurama replied, not quite understanding what Naruto was so upset about. \"I was just saying he looked cool in his outfit before, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru shook his head. <i>Not what he meant...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kurama could reply, Hunter spoke up. \"Thank you, Kurama,\" he said, striding over to the kit and patting him on the head. Kurama said nothing, but beamed in response. Naruto, meanwhile, turned away and grumbled, while Kiba just facepalmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So!\" The anthro suddenly exclaimed, stepping back from Kurama. \"Shall we get going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox kit beamed again, getting to his paws. \"Yeah!\" And, before any of them could blink, he had zipped over to the Kaepora Gaebora statue and plopped down next to it, smiling at the others expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed. \"Heh; eager, ain't he?\" Picking Akamaru up and putting him in the front of his shirt, he strolled over next to Kurama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, in spite of himself, giggled, his previous disgruntlement forgotten as he rushed over to the statue, coming to a stop next to Kurama. \"Heh, c'mon, Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, chuckling, walked back over to his bag and knelt down. \"OK, OK, lemme just get something...\" He rummaged about for a few seconds before he finally came up with the Ocarina. \"Perfect! And now, just one last thing....\" Then, to their surprise, he went about the room, picking up his scattered clothes and cramming them in the bag. Satisfied that he had gotten them all, he zipped it up. \"Dunno how long we're gonna be in Termina,\" he explained at the boys' confused faces, \"so I figured I'd better bring this just in case.\" Duffel in paw, he strolled on over to the statue, set it down, and hefted the Ocarina. \"You boys ready?\" At the chorus of \"Uh-huhs!\", he smiled, and brought the Ocarina to his muzzle. Closing his eyes, he thought of where he wanted to go, took a breath, and played that same set of three repeating notes a couple of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, a pair of massive white wings appeared, enveloped the group, emitted a light....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then the light faded, all five of them gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But once their eyes had adjusted, all four youths gazed in awe at the vast, rich sight around them, Kurama especially.  Hunter just glanced down at them and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so...beautiful...\" remarked the kit, as Hunter gazed upon the sight and nodded.  \"Yup.  Sure is, kiddo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around them, far as the eye could see; was an immensely vast valley, green and vibrant.  Naruto, Kiba, even Akamaru; all of them, were utterly dumbfounded by the rich, peaceful scenery.  Then, something caught Naruto's eyes.  \"Hey, look!\"  The others turned to where Naruto was pointing, and; if they didn't know any better...could SWEAR they saw snow in the distance, as a section of the field and the mountains and hills behind it looked shrouded in snow.  On the opposite end of that area, looked to be a much dryer scene, leading to two stone towers just barely visible past the mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru gazed upon the drastically different climates so close together.  <i>Wow, the climate's...different over here, isn't it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked and nodded.  \"Sure is.  Unlike Konoha and most worlds I visit, climates are aligned to each section of this little world.  Like that really dry mountainside with those towers waaaaay off in the distance?  That's Ikana Canyon.  And it can rain for days on end, but you'll never see anything green or colorful there...fitting for 'the land of the dead'.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let the boys shudder a bit to themselves as he smirked dismissively and pointed towards the snowy part that caught their eyes earlier.  \"That snowy area you guys see in the distance?  That's Snowhead Peak, where it's always snowy, cold, but still really fun; provided you don't get stuck in the blizzard and frozen...time and time again...\"  The three youths gulped nervously at the thought, but Kurama was just admiring the scenery, eyes wide and eager, not quite hearing as Hunter pointed to the tree besides them and what looked like a forested trail behind it.  \"This area?  Leads to Woodfall, where the Deku Kingdom resides in a swamp.  Sounds iffy, but it's actually a pretty nice place!  Didn't used to be not too long ago, but then again, none of Termina did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's all so pretty...\" mused Kurama, still utterly in awe.  Hunter just chuckled and said, \"It is, isn't it...buuuuut some entities were looking to take this world...and incinerate it with a giant evil moon, heh, but that can wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch closer in the more nearby distance however, grey walls surrounding and towering over a town with nothing but an immense clock tower visible well above the protective walls.  \"See that place walled off?\" Hunter asked, earning nods from the others.  \"That's Clock Town, and THAT'S where we'll have TONS of fun.  They got great games, great sights, and great food to boot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others grinned as their attention turned to their soon-to-be-destination, but Kurama's gaze was still fixed on the vibrant scenery around him.  \"So, whadduya kids wanna do first?\"  Hunter asked.  Naruto was about to reply, but he stopped and glanced back at Kurama, seeing the wonder in the young fox kits' eyes, and couldn't help but smile.  \"Tell ya what, why don't we let Kurama decide?\" the blonde boy answered.  Hunter smirked then nodded, stepping towards the young kit.  \"Well, kiddo?  How about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung Kurama turned to the wolf and asked, \"Do ya think we can...just, walk around for a little bit and see the sights?\"  Naruto was a bit taken back.  Of all things a child (or kit) would want, to just walk around and enjoy the scenery was seldom one of them, unless it involved racing in the fields, playing or anything like that.  But then, he recalled how Kurama probably never got to see many sights; even as a kit, and certainly wouldn't remember any from his malevolent adulthood.  All this kit remembered were the few times he and his other Tailed-Beast companions snuck out to nearby villages, never anything like this.  How could he not appreciate such a vibrant and unique sight?  How could anyone not appreciate it for that matter?  Nonetheless, he smiled and shrugged at the others.  \"Sounds like fun to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shrugged, a bit less interested.  \"Eh, whatever,\" the dog-nin replied, earning a chuckle and nod from Hunter.  \"Very well, lemme show you boys around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro then led the four youths throughout the field, showing them the grassy plains, the Observatory, and Great Bay past the snowy Snowpeak section, all the while, continuing to explain some of Termina's history to the four youths, noting how much more dangerous wandering the fields was back when monsters roamed its' lands, before they all fled with the departure of the frightful moon, and how a lone child by the name of Link, managed to save this entire world from certain doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Hunter stopped the boys as he saw a circle of bushes begin to wave about...then jump from their roots.  \"Whoa, what the heck is goin' on there?\" asked Kiba.  Hunter turned towards Kurama and said, \"See that?  That means a Keaton is right there.  To summon him, you need to destroy all those bushes in one single burst, and then he'll appear and...quiz you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four turned towards Hunter and raised an eyebrow.  \"Quiz?\" they all asked (and barked) in unison.  \"Yup.  See, Keaton's are well regarded, not only for their mythology, but because they're very intellectual creatures...they're also kinda snooty about it sometimes, but only a few.  Basically, they want to test your knowledge of Termina and the more colorful characters that reside in it, and if you get it right, they'll give you a Keaton mask...and sometimes, even jewels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, almost immediately, both Naruto and Kiba ran towards the still jumping bushes and tried attacking them to summon the Keaton, but the bushes...dissipated, leaving nothing.  Hunter just laughed.  \"Told ya, it had to be done in one attack...and in most cases, that means you need a sword.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys pouted as Kurama giggled.  \"Did you ever win that mask, Mr. Hunter?\"  Hunter chuckled then shook his head.  \"No, came pretty close though!\"  Then he looked away and grumbled in annoyance to himself.  <i>Would'a aced it, but c'mon, how the HELL was I supposed to know what color undies that weirdo Tingle wore over his tights?!</i>  the wolf mused internally, then shook it off and said, \"Well, the rest of Termina, we can't really explore without better, so you guys ready to see where the REAL fun happens in this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four youths glanced amongst themselves for a moment...</span></div></div>",

It's just...\" He looked around at the lush surroundings-tall grasses that swayed in the gentle breeze, several trees dotted about-and his expression softened, his eyes once again gleaming slightly in wonder. \"There's so much &lt;i&gt;space&lt;/i&gt;, and its so pretty, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Nine-Tails trailed off as he saw Naruto snickering. \"Wh-what? What's so funny?\" he asked uncertainly, feeling a little hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee...sorry, Kurama,\" Naruto apologized, getting his mirth under control. \"It's just...you don't have to apologize just for wantin' to play. Besides,\" he added, reaching out and resting a hand on the kit's shoulder, \"I kinda have a lotta pent up energy, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened. \"You...you don't mind waiting to go to Clock Town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, grinning, opened his mouth to reply, but Kiba abruptly shouldered in next to him. \"Here, I can answer that for ya...\" Reaching an arm out, he rapped Kurama lightly on his foreleg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama winced. \"Ow! What was....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're it!\" Kiba exclaimed, grinning. Turning around, he rushed off into the grass, Akamaru hopping out of his shirt and running alongside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, having watched the whole scene, smirked. <i>Well, that's one way to answer...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed. \"Ha, he got you good, Kurama!\" he exclaimed to the kit, who was looking a bit dazed.  The young fox said nothing, but simply stared after Kiba's retreating form. \"Uh, Kurama? You OK?\" Still, Kurama said nothing, causing Hunter to frown in concern a bit. <i>Is something wrong with the kid?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to Hunter's musings, Naruto stepped closer to Kurama. \"What, do ya not know how to play tag? 'Cause if ya don't, its really simp-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy let out a surprised yelp as nine bushy tails suddenly swung around and knocked him onto his rump. \"Ow! What the...\" He trailed off as he looked up and saw Kurama grinning down at him mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now <i>you're</i> it!\" the little Tailed Beast exclaimed gleefully, rushing on all fours off into the grass after Kiba. Nruto, for his part, simply stared after him, rubbing the seat of his pantts absentmindedly with both hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Hunter came up beside Naruto and knelt beside him, bending at the knees. \"Well, it looks like Kurama got <i>you</i> good, Naruto...\" the wolf joked, nuding the boy playfully in the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I guess he did...\" Naruto groused climbing to his feet and looking out into the grass where his friends had run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled and tousled Naruto's head. \"Aw, c'mon, don't be a sore loser.\" He looked out into the grass. \"Besides, the game's only just begun...and I do believe you're 'it', as it were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Naruto grinned, tensed his legs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and took off into the grass, eventually vanishing into it alongside the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, a triumphant cry of \"You're it, dog-breath!\" rang through the air, followed by a giggling Naruto being chased out of the grass by an equally merry Kiba, Akamaru, and Kurama. Naruto, however, had a pretty good lead on them, prompting him to look back, stick his tongue out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and promptly yelp as he tripped, falling flat on his face.  Hunter winced, but as he stepped forward to help, Kiba, Kurama, and Akamaru closed the distance and pounced on him, just as Naruto flipped onto his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde yelped again, scooting back just as they landed, causing the other three to land with a pained \"Oof!\" in a tangle of limbs. As they struggled to get up, Naruto, seeing an opportunity, smirked, got to his feet, and jumped upon them. This time, they were unable to get up as Naruto crashed upon them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, a bit bemused, watched as the others tumbled about in a ball, shouting, laughing, and swearing as arms, legs, and tails flailed about. As more and more gleeful laughter and giggles emanated from the tangle, the anthro smiled as they tumbled about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yep; definitely a good idea to bring them here,</i> the wolf mused, sitting down and watching the four tumble, chase each other, and generally have the time of their lives. <i>Wait'll we get to Clock Town, though; they might never wanna leave!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head and smiling, Hunter reached into his pocket, pulled out his MP3, and put the buds in his ears. Hitting the play button, he put it back in his pocket, sat up straight, and smiled as he watched the boys (and dog and fox) roughhouse. <i>Ah well; nothing to do right now but listen to some tunes and enjoy the sights....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The anthro continued watching the three youths and pup continue rough housing in the grass and chasing after each other in the fields, laughing (and barking) merrily as they did so.  As more time passed on, Hunter began to feel his eyelids getting heavier as the cool breeze greeted his fur.  Eventually, the wolf nodded off altogether and collapsed on his back, sprawled on the grass as the boys; oblivious, continued playing about, as the buds from his mp3 player continued to serenade the wolf's ears with tunes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time had passed, as the anthro began snoring.  That was short lived, however, when he felt three pairs of tiny hands gently rocking against his shoulder, shaking the wolf playfully before his eyes fluttered open, and saw two youthful faces and two fuzzy faces looking down at him and smiling widely, (in Akamaru's case, from atop Kiba's head) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph, afternoon to you as well, boys,\" replied Hunter as he pulled his ear buds off, sat up and yawned heartily, rubbing his eyes groggily before putting on his glasses and hopping up to his hind paws with surprising grace.  \"So, you boys have fun?\" Hunter asked, earning enthusiastic nods from all four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did!\" replied Kurama as Naruto laughed and wrapped his arm around the kits' shoulders pulling him close.  \"Yup!  And man oh man, does this guy know how to give a fella a run for his money!  I almost couldn't catch 'em!  <i>Almost...</i>\" the blonde replied, ruffling the young kyuubi's head playfully, causing the fox to giggle merrily as Kiba chuckled.  \"Yeah, so he had me flank 'em by surprise, but then we all ended up rolling down the hill in a massive dog-fox pile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru just snickered.  <i>I'll have you know that I caught Kurama just fine...I'm just so tiny that I don't think he noticed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama just giggled.  \"Course I noticed!  You jumped onto my face!\" replied Kurama playfully, causing the pup to snicker some more, with the two boys cracking up at the sight of Kurama running around with a tiny pup clamped onto his face.  Hunter just chuckled, \"Well, glad you kids and kit had a good time.  Now you ready for some REAL fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, all four youthful faces lit up with excitement and anticipation as Hunter smirked and led the kids onward towards the walled off town.  Upon arriving, all four were absolutely bewildered as Hunter smirked and said, \"Welcome to Clock Town, boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an absolute rush.  The sight was filled with life, people carrying about and kids running after each other and playing in the cobblestones and little ponds near the entrance.  There were several buildings and shops stacked right next to each other, but no sight more overwhelming than the massive stone tower looming over the entrance with, what looked like an equally massive and strangely patterned clock ticking right in the heart of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So THAT'S why they call this place Clock Town,\" blurted Naruto, as though in sudden realization.  Kiba snorted and said, \"Yeah, go figure the town with a freakin' giant clock would name their town after its' most distinguishin' feature.\"  Naruto immediately scowled and barked back with, \"H-hey, I've never been here before, dog-breath!  For all I know, the entire town could'a been made outta clocks, so shut-\"  The blonde stopped when he noticed Kurama's smile dissipate with a more nervous and slightly fearful look.  \"Kurama?  Something wrong, buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit rubbed the back of his orange-furred head and said, \"There's...a l-lot of people here...w-what if they don't want me here...?  They could get really mad...or worse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto immediately placed his hand on the kits shoulder and smiled warmly, \"Hey, c'mon, remember what Hunter said?  People aren't afraid of you here, in fact, they like creatures like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but what if they don't...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis concerns were stilted for a moment when he saw Naruto, Kiba and even Akamaru looking in a different direction near Kurama and grinning, causing the kit to tilt his head curiously.  \"Huh?  W-what is it...?\" the kit asked hesitantly, earning a soft chuckle from Hunter.  \"Ya might wanna turn around, kiddo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComplying, Kurama turned around and jumped back slightly when he saw a young boy, probably a little younger than Naruto and Kiba beaming up at the kit.  \"Uh...h-hello...\" greeted Kurama, smiling nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooooow...a Keaton!\" exclaimed the child in awe.  \"Hey, Mommy!  Look!  There's a Keaton in town!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama and even the others were a bit taken back as the boys' mother and some other nearby onlookers crowded the kit.  \"Holy cow....y'know, I've never seen one of you guys up close before,\" replied a large construction worker, still hauling a large plank of wood on his shoulder.  The boys' mom smiled and said, \"You know, my kids ALWAYS wanted to meet one of your kind before...I just didn't think one of you would ever actually show though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit sheepishly, Kurama chuckled and said, \"Well...n-nice to meet'cha all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the kit and his four other friends were startled when an old man jumped from the crowd and grabbed Kurama's front paws, as though shaking them as he said, \"And it's a great honor to meet YOU!  And may I say...what....dazzling attire you wear!\"  The kit blushed a bit beneath his fur and said, \"Aww, thanks!  I just...thought it looked really cool is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy?  Can I have a shirt like his?\" another small boy asked.  The mother gazed at the flame swirl on Kurama's shirt and said, \"Any shirt good enough for such a majestic creature is good enough for you, sweetie!  Come to think of it, I didn't know Keaton even wore clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Kurama worked a smile and said, \"Err...we don't USUALLY...\" then, as though getting the hang of it, the kit; a bit more confidently, added, \"...buuuuuuuuut I thought since I was visiting your wonderful town, I thought I'd try something different!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So very wise,\" the old man replied graciously, earning surprised stares from Naruto, Kiba, Hunter and Akamaru, but made Kurama giggle a bit and say, \"Awww, you guys are too nice.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a large old man with a mustache approached the crowd, and a bit more sternly, said, \"I think I speak for everyone here when I say, welcome to Clock Town!  Now, the rest of you lot, SCRAM!  How is this magnificent creature supposed to see our glorious town if all he sees are your faces crowding HIS?\"  The crowd nodded in unison and, after bidding the kit farewell and thanking him for reasons unbeknownst to either himself or his friends, took off, leaving the kit standing there in awe as the others stood there in silence for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru glanced curiously.  <i>Ummmm...what just happened...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked and said, \"Like I said, these guys really like Keaton.\"  Naruto approached Kurama and smiled, \"Told'ja you had nothin' to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were actually happy to see me...\" mused Kurama.  Kiba just snickered and internally, thought, <i>Probably because you're not a giant fuzzball accidentally knocking over their giant clock tower.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama turned to Hunter and, smiling widely, said, \"This place is gonna be awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled and ruffled the kit's head.  \"Sure is, kiddo.  Suuuuure is.\"  He then glanced at all four youths and asked, \"So, whadduya boys wanna do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four youths glanced amongst themselves for a moment...</span></div></div>",

It seems really cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded, tilting his head upward and sniffing. \"Yeah, and there are all kinds of interesting smells, too; I don't think I've even smelled half of them before!\" Akamaru, from atop Kiba's head, barked his agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. \"Well, I can't smell like Kiba 'n Akamaru can, but I'm with Kurama; this town seems really neat!\" He looked up at Hunter expectantly. \"Can we look around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled, tousling the blonde's hair. \"Hey, that's why I brought you guys here, isn't it?\" His tail wagged as the youths cheered happily.\" Ha ha, that's the spirit!\" Turning around, he motioned for the boys to follow him. \"C'mon, follow me: I'm gonna show you a part of town where there's a lotta fun stuff going on!\" Tail still wagging, he set off, the other four following behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which part is that, Mr. Hunter?\" Kurama inquired as he trotted alongside the others on all fours (after all, even if he could sit up like a human and use his forelegs as arms, he still needed to get around on all fours.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked back at him and grinned. \"That part, Kurama, would be East Clock Town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nSoon, the five had reached the area that Hunter had mentioned, and before long, the youths were \"ooh\"ing and \"ah\"ing at the various sights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled at their reactions. \"Heh, it's pretty nifty, ain't it?\" He spread his arms wide as they strolled through the streets, smiling warmly as several townsfolk passed by and waved enthusiastic greetings at Kurama. A bit flustered, Kurama nonetheless grinned and waved with his tails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a weird feeling, to be sure: when he'd been with the Old Man, he and the others had always been feared by humans, who would often scream, run, and occassionally throw rocks at them. When he'd asked the Old Man why they acted like this, the sage had explained that people feared what they did not understand...that, and the fact they were originally the Ten-Tails, the creature that had terrorized the world. It hadn't been like <i>they'd</i> done anything, though, except maybe break some stuff by accident...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the people here...they were happy to see him; thrilled, in fact! Kurama smiled as he thought of all the warm words, the praise, and the happy surprise he'd had showered upon him, and all he'd done was show up in town! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama sighed happily. <i>I hope we can stay here for a few days...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurama? You OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the fox's head snapped up, and he looked toward Naruto, who was looking at him with concern. Giggling, Kurama shrugged his shoulders. \"Yeah, I'm fine. I was just thinking...this place seems really nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled. \"Yeah, it does, doesn't it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Eh, yeah, it seems nice, but let's see what we can do here, first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, ears twitching, looked back at them. \"Oh, there's plenty of fun stuff to do here. There's the Treasure Chest Shop-that's where you go through a maze to get to a treasure chest with goodies inside-, Honey and Darling's Shop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's little muzzle contorted in disgust. \"Ewwww...that sounds icky...\" Naruto and Kiba quickly grumbled their assent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled. \"Oh, trust me, its more fun than it sounds. Ya play a certain type of game, and ya have to get a certain score before the shop's proprietors stop dancing. If ya do, ya get a prize.\" Turning back to the front, he folded his arms behind his head. \"And then, of course, there's the Shooting Gallery, which is pretty much exactly what it sounds like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Sounds like a lotta fun1\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned. \"Sure is, and that's only this part of town! There's also the Deku Scrub Playground, a park, the Lottery Shop...\" Abruptly, he stopped and turned around, the kids skidding to a stop as he did so. \"Sounds like an awful lot just to do in one day, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama nodded. \"Yeah, sure does...\" His eyes suddenly widened, and he looked up at Hunter. \"Wait; you mean...\" he asked, eyes wide and voice full of so much hope it was almost heartbreaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking it off, Hunter managed a grin. \"Boys,\" he began, folding his paws behind his back. \"I would like to take this moment to personally welcome you all to your week-long Terminan vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba's eyes widened. \"A week?\" Naruto asked. \"We're really gonna be here for a week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed, tousling both their heads. \"Yep; there's a lot to see in Termina, and one or two days just ain't enough...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro's eyes widened as he felt something clamp around his legs. Blinking, he looked down to see Kurama hugging him tightly. \"Th-thanks...\" the little Nine-Tails muttered, looking up at Hunter with the most grateful smile the wolf had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit taken aback, Hunter nonetheless smiled. \"Aw, don't mention it, little guy.\" He flicked one of Kurama's long ears affectionately, eliciting a happy giggle from the kit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kiba, and Akamaru, though far from displeased, looked at each other uncertainly. They'd already been gone from the village a few days; how were they gonna react to them being gone for a full week?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Hunter caught their look. He smiled and gave them a knowing wink. A bit confused, the three nonetheless looked at each other and shrugged. Doubtless, Hunter had figured out hat was bothering them, and would work something out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, smiles formed on their faces as they looked at one another. Might as well enjoy themselves....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kurama released Hunter's legs, though he still looked up at him with a huge smile on his face. \"So, Mr. Hunter, which place do ya think is the most fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter winked at the kit. \"Well, they're all pretty fun...\" he glanced around for a moment, as though getting a feel for his surroundings. \"...but we're closest to the Shooting Gallery, so whaddaya say we check that out first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the boys' eager assent, Hunter chuckled and continued leading them on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While both Kiba and Akamaru chattered amongst themselves, Naruto found himself observing the young kyuubi, happily taking in all the sights, the sounds and the occasional greeting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something about seeing the youthful creature so happy and...if Naruto didn't know better; humbled by the town and all its' people, that just tugged at the boy's heart.  Despite himself, he couldn't help but smile back at the sight.  Kiba, however, caught wind of this, and found himself thinking differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Uzumaki...can I ask you something...?\" the young dog-nin whispered to the blonde, who turned his attention towards Kiba.  \"Huh?  Why're ya whispering?\" asked Naruto, only be subtly hushed by Kiba.  \"I was just wonderin'...\" Kiba stopped himself and exhaled, nervously rubbing the back of his head, much to Naruto's and even Akamaru's curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay with this...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scratched his head.  \"Being here a whole week?  Weeeell, it'd be cool, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, not that...\" interrupted Kiba as he pointed towards Kurama, who was once again getting greeted by a few more ongoers.  \"...That.  Look, I don't wanna throw a wrench into anything, but, it doesn't bother you that, well, when you were a kid, you got a bum deal cause'uh him...but now that he's a kid, he's...kinda getting treated like royalty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined a bit to himself.  <i>How is that NOT trying to put a wrench into things...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise however, Naruto smirked and shook his head.  \"Well, for starters, these people think he's something else.  Think if we were back home, he'd even get a chance to see sights like this?  Besides...\" Naruto stopped and turned towards the kit, seeing him giggle as a rather large butterfly began fluttering around his nose, earning another smile from Naruto, as he said, \"...that's not the hate filled monster I know.  He didn't do anything wrong...and, like me...he's paid for the other Kurama's crimes too.  I'm just glad he can have this...however long or brief it might be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit taken back, Kiba looked down a bit, before glancing back up at Naruto and warmly wrapping his arm around the blonde boys' shoulder, patting his arm playfully as he did.  \"Y'know somethin', Uzumaki?  You might be a pint-sized, dopier than dopy dope...but I hope you never change.\"  Rolling his eyes, Naruto smirked and nudged the boy back.  \"Yeah, yeah, don't get all mushy on me, dog-breath.\"  Akamaru just wagged his tail at the sight from atop Kiba's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, boys, here we are!\" exclaimed Hunter, causing all four youths to line up excitedly before the anthro as he pointed to what looked like a massive wooden statue of a squid-like creature mounted atop a large wooden building.  \"East Clock Town Shooting Range.  Where archers put their skills to the test, and laugh at the one or two dopes who forget how hard shooting a bow and arrow can be...shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly, all four nodded as Hunter smiled and held the door open for all four.  Surprisingly, the building wasn't as rustic as the exterior made it seem, but instead...quite colorful.  From behind a blue and purple painted archers line was a large pool with no targets in sight.  \"Welcome tuh the range, fellers,\" greeted a huskier, more heavy set voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, all five turned to a large, hulking man wearing patterned pants, an opened brown vest exposing his bulky body, a bull cut hairstyle and a mug that only a mother could love...if she were blind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing his throat, Hunter smiled and approached the counter from which the man was standing.  \"Hello, sir!  I'm visiting from...somewhere else, and I thought I'd show my young friends here a fun time at your glorious shooting range!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.  And which one'uh them's goin' first?\" asked the large man with disinterest.  Immediately, Naruto raised his hand and hopped up.  \"Ooh!  Ooh!  Right here!  I've always wanted to try one of those things out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren'tcha a lil small, kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah!  I got this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, the burly man handed Naruto a bow and quiver with 20 bows in it.  Immediately, the man slammed on a switch, and from the water, popped three wooden 'squid-like' creatures with piercing but dopy and sad looking yellow eyes and a large beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning confidently, Naruto held up his bow, and reached for an arrow while all four others watched him with anticipation.  And as soon as the arrow was along the strings, Naruto pulled back...or...tried to, unable to build up enough strength to pull the string of the bow back, causing the arrow plopped right down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others stared blankly at the grounded arrow for a moment, then immediately burst into a fit of laughter, much to Naruto's annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, the man took the bow and said, \"Told ya, kid.  Here, we got somethin' more your size...\"  He then handed Naruto an odd looking slingshot with a bag of hard and bizarre looking nuts of sorts.  \"Now, give it a shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off his earlier embarrassment, Naruto loaded up his slingshot, took aim, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POW!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlasted one of the targets dead in the face, much to his relief and the impressed gazes of his four buddies.  \"Hey, that wasn't half bad, bone-head,\" remarked Kiba, admittedly impressed.  Kurama smiled and said, \"Show those mean ol' squid thingies whose boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning confidently, Naruto fired some more, hitting more targets.  But then, the targets began to move, causing Naruto to either miss or not hit them in time before they could be called back.  He got lucky and nailed a few others, but by the end of the game, he'd hit...MAYBE seven or eight targets...out of twenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad for a first try, kid,\" said the burly man as he took Naruto's slingshot and glanced down at the others.  \"So?  Who else wants tuh give this a go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others glanced amongst themselves for a moment.</span></div></div>",

Can I go next?\" Kurama asked, face alight with anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed a bit, reaching an arm out and giving the kit a friendly pat on the back. \"Eh, I guess you can go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling warmly, Hunter put a paw on Kurama's head, looking down at him. \"Go for it, kiddo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama needed no second bidding: he bolted out from under Hunter's paw and rushed up to the man. \"Can I have the slingshot, please?\" He thought for a moment. \"And that bag of shoot-y nuts, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow, the man nonetheleass handed him the weapon and the ammo. <i>A Keaton, using the gallery? That's a first....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it in his paws, Kurama giggled. \"Thanks, mister!\" Still giggling, he placed the slingshot in his mouth, rushed up to  the top of the steps, and settled back into an upright sitting position. <i>Alright, now how did Naruto do this...</i> Taking the slingshot in one paw, he held it up in front of him, grabbed the band, and pulled it back. A grin lit up his face. <i>Perfect!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the man, Kurama exclaimed, \"OK, mister! I'm ready to start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head at the strangeness of the whole situation, the man shrugged and slammed on the button again, once again bringing up the strange wooden squid-creatures. \"And...go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kurama loaded up one of the nuts in the slingshot, pulled it back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait a minute...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back toward the man, he asked, \"Um, 'scuse me? Mister?\" When the man looked up at him, he continued, somewhat nervously, \"I know we usually get hat bow or slingshot to hit the targets...but if we could it it ourselves, would that be OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Naruto asked, scratching his head. \"He's not gonna use the slingshot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow, Kiba folded his arms. \"How the hell's he expect to hit them without it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching an ear, Hunter tilted his head a bit. \"Uh, I got nothing.\" <i>Still, something tells me he's got something planned...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, from atop Kiba's head, whined. <i>I have a really, really, REALLY bad feeling about this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, oblivious, stared at Kurama for a few seconds before shrugging. \"Eh, nothing that says ya can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's muzzle split in a wide smile. \"Yay! Thanks, mister!\" Turning back around to face the gallery, he set the slingshot back on the steps, took a deep breath...and then, to their surprise, settled back into his upright sitting position, resting his forelimbs on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Naruto asked. \"What's he doing?\" Louder, he called, \"Hey, Kurama?\" Ears twitching, Kurama turned his head, smiling warmly at his blonde friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Naruto?\" the kit asked. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rubbed the back of his head. \"Um...what are you doing?\" To his surprise, the kit giggled and winked back at him. Akamaru gulped. <i>Scratch that; I've got a really, really, really, REALLY monumentally bad feeling about this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to the dog's musing, Kurama focused his attention back on the pool and the wooden creatures inside it. He took another deep breath. <i>OK...let's hope this works...</i> Closing his eyes, he tilted his head back and opened his muzzle as wide as it could go. His friends and the man watched, utterly confused...a confusion which only increased when small particles of various reds and blues began materializing and gathering above the kit's open mouth. \"Uh...\" the man began, not remotely sure what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter wasn't much better. \"Naruto, what's he doing?\" he whispered to the blonde boy. Naruto simply looked back at him with an equally confused look and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, enough of the particles had gathered to form a dark purple/black orb above Kurama's mouth. Kiba's eyes widened. \"The hell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That...doesn't look good...</i> Akamaru whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the whiles, the particles continued gathering, slowly swelling the ball larger and larger. Kurama grunted a bit. <i>Nngh..c'mon, just a liiiiittle bigger...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the particles were coming in more slowly, and the ball wasn't growing as quickly, but grow it did, until, finally, it was about softball sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned at the sight of it. <i>Eh, it's not as big as Gyuki can do it...but I think this is good.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the ball suspended in front of his muzzle, Kurama slowly lowered his head, bringing it to directly to face the pool. His eyes dancing with delight and anticipation, he opened his muzzle wider...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba jerked as he saw Akamaru clamber down the front of his face and into his shirt. \"Akamaru? What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup shuddered. <i>I just thought it might be a good idea to take cover.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked. \"How co---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...at that moment, the ball streaked from Kurama's jaws. It made a beeline for the nearest target, striking it dead-on....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FWOOOSH!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and detonating in a massive explosion that engulfed the entire pool area, rising up and sending the water splashing all over the room, hitting everyone standing in it. Oddly enough, smoke still accompanied the massive surge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dust cleared, Naruto, Kiba, Hunter, Akamaru, and the gallery's owner were all staring, as one, at the young kit that had created the tremendous explosion, their jaws doing their very best to make contact with the ground. Surprisingly, the steps were still intact, but as the smoke cleared away completely, they could see that the pool and targets...had not been so lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere appeared to be a huge crater where the pool used to be, all the water in it completely gone. There were various pieces of wood scattered about the crater, with more still raining down into the pit. As they looked up, they noticed that the roof appeared to have a rather sizable hole in it, though not anywhere near as big as the crater was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widening, Kurama examined what he'd done. <i>Whooaaaaa...that's the biggest Tailed Beast Ball I've ever done...</i> Turning around, he saw the others staring at him with equally wide eyes. Blinking, he took a breath....and broke out in a huge grin. \"So? How'd I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them said anything for a moment. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurama?\" Naruto spoke up in a low voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama flinched a bit, and he looked back at the destruction. He gulped. He'd gotten so carried away, he'd wrecked this place, just like he and the other Tailed Beasts had accidentally done. \"Y-yeah, Naruto...?\" the kit enquired uncertainly, tugging at his collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked up...and his own face split in a huge grin. \"That was AWESOME!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama recoiled a bit at this sudden exclamation, only to grin as Naruto rushed up the steps and slapped his hands on his shoulders. \"Y-you're not mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scoffed. \"Hey, the object was to hit all the targets, right?\" He indicated the wreckage of the wooden squid creatures. \"Looks to me like you hit all of them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama followed Naruto's hand. \"Yeah, I guess I did. Which means...\" His eyes flew wide open. \"I won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike lightning, he took off, accidentally making Naruto stumble as he rushed up to the gallery's owner. As soon as he reached the man, though, his smile faded, and he remembered how much damage he had done. \"Um, Mister? A-about your shop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shrugged. \"Eh, don't worry about it; I was thinking about remodeling this place anyway.\" Then, to his surprise, the man smiled. \"First, though, I gotta give you your prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama tilted his head. \"Prize?\" He asked, anticipation in his voice as Naruto came up behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded and walked back over to his desk, withdrawing a rather sizable bag from it. Grunting, he brought it over to the kit and dropped it in front of him. \"Here ya go, kid; for hitting all the targets in record time, you get 200 Rupees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scratched his head as Kurama began rooting around in the bag. \"Huh? What the heck are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened as he came across something. \"Naruto, look!\" the kit exclaimed. Curious, Naruto walked over and knelt down...and his eyes widened as he saw what was within the bag. There were a great many gems inside of varying colors, and they all seemed to sparkle. \"Wow..\" Naruto breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Kurama noted, picking one up and examining it. \"It's so pretty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling as he, Kiba, and Akamaru came up behind them, Hunter ruffled Kurama's head. \"Those there are Rupees, kiddo. They're the main form of currency around here...\" He grinned as he saw the bags contents. \"...and with that many, there's a lot you can buy!\" Looking around, he grimaced. \"And considering the place is wrecked, we'll probably need other stuff to occupy our time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned. \"No problem; there's a lot of stuff to do in town, right?\" At Hunter's nod, he grabbed the bag, tugged...and grunted. \"Ugh, it's really heavy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled. \"Here, lemme take care of that for ya.\" Reaching down, he grabbed the bag, hefted it over his shoulder, and stood up. \"Sorry about all this,\" he apologized to the man. \"If there's anything we can do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man waved him off. \"Like I said, don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinked. \"O...OK...\" Shrugging, he turned around and beckoned for the youths to follow him. As they neared the exit, Hunter asked, \"so, kids, we got some money; whaddaya wanna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four thought for a moment...</span></div></div>",

Blushing bright red beneath his orange fur, the young kyuubi placed a paw on his stomach and; somewhat sheepishly, said, \"Ehehe, s-sorry about that.  I think summoning such a ginormous Tailed-Beast Ball made me kinda hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, some slightly less audible rumblings emanated from the tummies of the other three youths.  Laughing, Naruto wrapped his arm around the kits' shoulder and said, \"Haha, now that you mention it, I'm kinda famished too.\"  Nodding, Kiba rubbed his stomach and said, \"No surprise.  I don't think we had any breakfast yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked in agreement.  <i>And all that world traveling and gallery exploding's enough to work up an appetite for ANYONE!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Hunter nodded, just as his own stomach began rumbling hungrily.  \"All valid points,\" the anthro remarked, rubbing his stomach hungrily.  \"Luckily, I know just the place!  And as it so happens...it's also the only place in this town where a group of weary travelers can rent a room for the night...or seven, hehe.  Right this way, boys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Hunter the led the way, bag of Rupees firmly at hand with Kurama eagerly trotting right besides him.  Naruto, Kiba and Akamaru, however still hesitant about the seven nights remark, nonetheless smiled eagerly ready to sate their hunger, and followed close behind, all the while, coming across another batch of colorful faces, greeting the group and Kurama especially.  As they did, Akamaru couldn't help but tilt his head as he saw people idly greeting the group and Hunter especially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I get that this is a different world from ours, but still, I'm a little surprised that people here don't seem so...shocked about a walking, talking wolf person strolling around through town.  Do you visit here often?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled and shook his head.  \"Every so often, sure, but not as much as I'd like.  Besides, Termina's a VERY colorful place, if you haven't noticed by now, an anthropomorphic wolf is one of the more normal things you're likely to see in a world occupied by talking tree people, volcano dwelling rock eaters, and-\"  Hunter stopped mid-sentence when he saw a rubbery white-skinned fish man approaching them with what looked like a large fish skeleton made in the shape of a guitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe timing was just too perfect, Hunter snickered and added, \"-and those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious, the Zora glanced back at the gang and said, \"Oi!  You blokes know where da Mllk Bar's at?  If I'm late f'er re'ersal, me manag'uh's gonna take me ov'a t'uh Pinnacle'n feed me to a bleedin' eel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four youths just blinked blankly for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...A-anyone speak fish...?\" asked Naruto, scratching his head nervously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just laughed.  \"I didn't know The Indigo-Go's were back in town!  You the new guitarist?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zora nodded, waving his 'bangs' as he did.  \"Used to jam with Mikau all the time before he...well, you know...so I thought I owed it tuh him to keep the band afloat with Lulu, Evan and the other blokes aaaaaaand now I'm officially 'bout tuh be chum...less the place is right beneath us 'er somethin'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Hunter gave the Zora a wink and said, \"Well, you're in luck, cause the Milk Bar is just down these stairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFace lighting up, the guitarist sprinted down, waving back at the gang.  \"Bloody brilliant, mate!  Milk's on me if ya ever get drop by!\" he said as he sprinted down towards the bar, leaving Hunter grinning and the others...well, confused, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Naruto started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What just happened...?\" added Kiba, earning a nod of agreement from Naruto as they all looked up at Hunter for an explanation.  \"Haha, loooooooong story, boys.  Anywho, here we are!\"   The wolf pointed upward towards a two story building.  The sign up top read, 'Stock Pot Inn.'  Again, Naruto scratched his head uncertainly.  \"So wait, we're eating an Inn...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just ruffled the boys head.  \"Trust me, you guys won't be the least bit disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite themselves, the others just shrugged.  Afterall, Hunter hadn't steered them wrong so far.  And so, they headed on into a very polished and modest looking inn, with a tall, red headed woman looking to be in her mid twenties standing behind the counter.  \"Oh!  Hello there!\" she said in a peppy tone as the others approached.  \"Welcome to the Stock Pott Inn!  My name is Anju!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled and rubbed the back of his head.  \"Heh...err, yeah, I remember from the last couple times I dropped by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I-I'm sorry, heh, I'm not so good with faces, to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled.  \"Not even fuzzy faces like his?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Anju's face lit up.  \"Oh!  A Keaton!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others jerked back, startled as the peppy woman rushed over and leaned in towards a taken back Kurama.  \"You know, I've always wanted to see one of you guys up close before!  Sure, I have once or twice...but I...kinda forgot...STILL, a grand honor!\"  She then reached her hand and gently pet the top of Kurama's head.  \"I'll say this much, I may not recall the other Keatons, but I KNOW they didn't look anywhere near as adorable as you do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, the kit blushed beneath his fur and smiled up at Anju.  \"Awww, thanks!\" the kit replied, earning snickers from the others.  Just then, Kurama's stomach rumbled louder than ever, making the kit's blushing actually visible beneath his orange fur.  Hunter just laughed and said, \"Speaking of which, we were wondering if the kitchen's open, cause my young friends and I are quite famished from our travels!  Also, could we get a room?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju nodded.  \"Most certainly!\"  She then glanced down at Kurama and smiled warmly.  \"And don't you worry about a thing, little fella, you won't be hungry for long once you see what our new chef can whip up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smiled graciously at the woman and took two Red Rupees out of his bag to pay for the room.  \"And don't worry about the food.  It's on us!  But...you may wanna tip the chef when you're done.  He gets...kinda cranky...\"  Anju remarked as she led the gang over to the cafeteria, where only they resided, all seated on a table in the center of the area.  \"Go ahead and take a look.  When you're ready to order, lemme know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked around curiously while the others glanced down at their menus.  \"Seems kinda dead, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter glanced idly at the empty cafeteria and nodded.  \"Business is typically fairly slow, yeah.  But you should see this place during Festival Season.  Anju and her mother wrack in more business during the festivities than they do in the entire year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled as he glanced back to where Anju had exited and said, \"She's a really nice lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned mischievously.  \"AND she thinks you're cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the normally orange furred kits' face lit redder than a cherry.  But Hunter just laughed assuredly.  \"Sorry, kiddo, but she's taken.  Y'know, fun fact, this place didn't used to be an Inn.  It actually used to the most renown restaurant in all of Termina.  But then the first owner of this place, Tortus; Anju's old man, passed away and left it to her and her mom...and of course, Anju; sweet as she may be, can't cook to save her life...soooo they turned it into an Inn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others then glanced up at Hunter questionably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...why are we eating here...?\" asked Naruto.  To which, Hunter pointed in the air, just as the fryers sounded off from the kitchen.  Suddenly, a heavenly aroma wafted across the table, enticing all who took a whiff.  \"THAT'S why,\" replied Hunter slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap...\" remarked Kiba, practically salivating.  \"Smells like pot roast, but...oh man...I can taste the spices...the seasonings from HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" piped Hunter happily.  \"I dunno who their new cook is, but whoever he or she is...they can cook.  I hear Anju and her husband are actually planning on making a 'grand announcement' to the town about it once she gets a few more taste testers.  For now, she just keeps it to her customers.  That's why it was on the house.  Which reminds me...no dark purple plasma-er-whatever balls here, Kurama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the kit giggled, blushing as he did and nodded.  \"Ehehe...yeaaaah...honest, I didn't mean to wreck that big guy's store!  I just got a lil...carried away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru tilted his head.  <i>A 'little'...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickering to himself, Naruto once again patted the kit on the shoulder and said, \"Hey, carried away or not, that was still pretty damn awesome!  Besides, he was cool with it, wasn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter glanced quizzically, hearing that last remark and nodded.  \"Yeah, he was...still kinda weird actually...I half expected us to be out on our rumps after that...or for him to use that bow and arrow and make US his new targets...\" remarked Hunter, shuddering at the thought.  But Kiba scoffed and said, \"Ah, he could probably afford it!  I mean, if he's giving away that much money for knocking all the targets at once, then he probably doesn't mind spending a bit more to spruce his place up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked in agreement.  <i>Though, I'm willing to bet he won't be as okay with letting people destroy targets 'on their own' after that...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group shared in a laugh, as Naruto stared idly for a moment, but nonetheless laughed anyway.  Eventually, they glanced back down at the menus, until Anju returned with a pen and paper ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, have you boys decided what you'd like?\"</span></div></div>",

Well,\" she began, stepping back, \"the Roasted Cuccoo platter is an extra-large Romani Ranch Cuccoo roasted and cooked with the best herbs and spices this side of Termina, with mashed potatoes and peas on the side...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Kurama's muzzle screwed up at that. \"Ewww, peas?\" the young Nine-Tails muttered. \"I don't like veggies...\" To emphasize his point, he screwed his eyes shut and stuck his tongue out. This, in turn, elicited a round of snickers and snorts from Naruto and Kiba. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju, for her part, didn't seem offended at all; if anything, her smile deepened. \"Well, that's not surprising, considering how young you are, but trust me, once you taste these peas, you'll change your tune....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, in spite of himself, opened his eyes and looked at Anju curiously. Hunter, not wanting to spoil anything, cut in. \"Yeah, and peas taste really great when ya mix 'em up with mashed potatoes.\" He winked at Kurama. \" Trust me, you ain't gonna be disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama tilted his head at Hunter, but nonetheless smiled. After all, he'd been nice enough to take him to this cool town, take him out of that scary place, AND treat him to the single yummiest thing he'd ever eaten in his life, and if Hunter said it was good, then it must be good. With that thought in mind, he looked toward Naruto and Kiba. \"Is  the roasted Cuccoo Platter good with you guys?\" He beamed as they nodded enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Hunter looked toward Anju. \"Well, in that case, tell your chef we'll take the Roasted Cuccoo Platter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent choice!\" Anju chirped, scribbling on the paper. \"And would you like anything to drink with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro thought for a moment. \"Hmm...could we get a pitcher of soda and some glasses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju nodded, scribbling the additional request on the paper. \"You certainly can!\" Standing back up with the paper in hand, she bustled off. \"I'll give your orders to the chef, and he'll get right on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded, smiling at her energy. <i>Well, at least we know the chef's a 'he'...</i> he mused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked up. \"Hmm?\" He directed his attention toward the fox kit. \"Something up, Kurama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit shifted in his seat a bit. \"Um, you ordered something for us to drink called 'soda'. What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Hunter raised a paw, but Naruto motioned for him to hold off. \"I ain't gonna spoil it for ya,\" Naruto began, throwing a friendly arm about Kurama's shoulders. \"but I'm gonna say this: you're gonna love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Kurama's face lit up. \"Ooh! Is it gonna be as yummy as ice cream?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms behind his head. \"Weelll, it's a little different, but yeah; it's real good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama looked over at the little dog-nin. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked. <i>You better believe it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed, rubbing the back of his head and marveling at the sheer <i>ease</i> with which the youths interacted. They really had become good friends in such a short time, Naruto and Kurama especially....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>S'not fair,</i>} Hunter thought, his smile fading a bit. <i>Just because that sweet, innocent, adorable little kit grows up into a vicious, hateful monster...and I STILL have no idea how that happened...he's gonna hafta go back inside Naruto once the week's up.</i> He shook his head. <i>It's just not fair...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking himself (and feeling a surge of relief at the distraction,) Hunter looked across the table at the young blonde. \"Y-yeah, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned, scratching the back of his head. \"This is gonna sound weird...but what's a Cuccoo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinked. \"What's a...\" Realization hit, and he chuckled a bit. \"Oh yeah, you're new to Termina...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba rolled his head. \"What, ya didn't realize that before? But yeah, we wanna be sure we're not gonna be eating some sorta weird animal....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled. \"Not to worry, boys; Cuccoos are basically just this world's version of chickens. So, we're basically gonna be eating a big ol' roast chicken with the works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes lit up, and he licked his chops. \"Ooh, I like chickens...\" His muzzle screwed up again, this time in thought. \"But how big is it gonna be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked. \"Youuuuuuu'll see,\" the anthro wolf replied teasingly. \"Oh, and one more thing, Kurama...\" Seeing he had the kit's attention, Hunter rubbed the back of his head a bit nervously. \"Um, between the five of us, the Cuccoo's probably not gonna do much more except make us look like we had a really good meal-ya know, making our guts bulge beneath our shirts but not much else- but just in case we decide to get something else afterwards...\" Taking a deep breath, and praying it wasn't gonna come out creepy, asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going commando, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba spluttered at the question, but Kurama just tilted his head. \"Huh? What's 'going commando'?\" the young Tailed Beast asked, completely oblivious to the shocked looks on his human (and canine) friends' faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed nervously, scratching the side of his head. \"It, um...it means you're wearing pants without any underwear.\" Seeing Kurama's confusion deepen, he continued, \"I-I mean, since you're covered head-to-toe in fur like yours truly, its not like anything would be showing anyway if your fly ends up needing to be opened, but I was just wondering...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, Kurama giggled. \"Heehee, don't worry, Mr. Hunter; I found a really cool-looking pair of underwear while I was lookin' for these clothes in the closet.\" He beamed. \"They're really comfy, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba stared at Kurama, their faces set in awkward expressions, but before they could say anything....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow,\" Naruto exclaimed, taking a deep sniff. \"Wouldja smell that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's face lit up as he and Akamaru sniffed the air in unison. \"Oh, I smell that...oh man, the spices, the seasonings...they smell AWESOME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling as he took in the heavenly aroma, Hunter nodded. \"Heh, just wait till you try it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five lapsed into silence as they continued taking in the delightful aromas of the Cuccoo cooking, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sound of footsteps approaching caught the ears of all five parties, and immediately, they turned to the source.  Hunter chuckled softly as he saw the faces of his (currently) youthful pals light up like children on Christmas morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Anju smiled back at the youths as she approached them, carrying a rather bountiful platter of Roasted Cuccoo's.  Indeed, as Hunter described it, they looked just like slightly larger roasted chickens, but the sheer abundance of spices, herbs, seasonings wafting from the roasted Termina paltry was enough to make all four youths mouths and maws water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling softly herself, Anju placed the platter down atop the table and glanced at the four youths.  \"Yeah, we get that a lot, these days,\" she remarked with a smile as she placed down five plates in front of her patrons, each one loaded with an ample pile of mashed potatoes and peas on the side.  Again, Kurama glanced down at the peas for a moment and grimaced.  <i>Blech, veggies...icky!</i> the young kyuubi thought for a moment, but rather than verbally express his disdain, he recalled what Anju had said earlier, then looked up at her, somewhat skeptically, but nevertheless, asked, \"Ms. Anju?  Are you <i>sure</i> these peas aren't going to be icky...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the other boys; even Akamaru started snickering to themselves, but Anju just smiled and nodded assuredly.  \"I promise, one bite and you'll know how 'un-icky' they are,\" she said as she playfully pet the kit's head, once again eliciting more amused giggles from the young kyuubi as he nodded back, smiling a wide smile as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme go get your drinks,\" she added before heading back, leaving Naruto, Kiba, Kurama and Akamaru to just gaze upon the roasted Cuccoo glory, taking in all the scents at once.  \"Not bad, eh?\" remarked Hunter, earning enthusiastic nods from all four youths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that...is...the YUMMIEST thing I've ever smelled!\" the young fox kit exclaimed eagerly.  Naruto grinned and playfully nudged Kurama.  \"You ain't kidding, buddy!  Heck, I almost wish I had that scent mask on right about now!\"  Grinning impishly, Kiba snorted and said, \"Yeah, me too, then I wouldn't hafta look'it your ugly mug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just snickered a bit, while Kurama glanced curiously at the dog-nin, before snickering a bit himself.  What he said was mean, to be sure, but Kurama had quickly learned that was just the way these two communicated with each other, possibly even part of what made their friendship so strong, or why hanging out with them was proving to be so amusing for the kit.  Surprisingly, Naruto didn't even give the remark much heed at all, due to simply being overwhelmed by the zesty scents wafting across their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Anju returned, placing an ample pitcher of cola next to the platter, and placed cups all around the table before taking a step back.  \"Well, don't suppose I have to tell you, but...bon appetit!\" she said cheerfully, then headed back to her other duties at the Inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned then said, \"Well?  We gonna sit here and oogle the roasted Cuccoos all day?  Or are we gonna cram as much of these zesty birdies as we can possibly fit into our maws?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, little Akamaru barked eagerly, wagging his tail enthusiastically as he did.  <i>You don't gotta tell me twice!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious, Naruto just shrugged and jokingly, added, \"What he said!  W-whatever that might'uh been...unless he was making fun of me...again...\"  Laughing, Hunter nodded, and; held his paw forward, gesturing to the Cuccoos as each youth immediately reached in and placed one on their plate, followed by Hunter, shortly after.  Kiba; of course, grabbed two and placed one atop Akamaru's plate for him, earning another happy bark from the pup as he hopped up and licked his dog-nin companions face, earning a laugh from the boy as he ruffled the pups' head and placed him before his plate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto licked his lips eagerly and grabbed his fork and knife, ready to sink his teeth into this roasted bird, but stopped as he saw Kurama eagerly licking his chops as well.  Smiling, he put his silverware down and said, \"Say, Kurama,\" he started, earning the kits attention.  \"Would'ja do the honors of takin' the first bite'n lettin' us know how it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" the kit asked, earning a nod and a friendly pat on the shoulder from the blonde boy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I trust your judgement, plus, you probably got better taste buds than the rest of us...cept maybe dog-breath, but he's a dunce, so who cares?\" Naruto replied, earning a scowl from Kiba, and snickers from Hunter and Akamaru.  \"Ah, look who's talkin', Mister-I-Locked-Myself-Out-Again-Cause-I'm-Emperor-Dumbass...\" grumbled Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, Kurama wasn't sure why Naruto and company wouldn't just take the first bite and taste for themselves if these Cuccoos really were as yummy as they smelled.  Nonetheless, he beamed warmly at his blonde friend, for the kind words and vote of confidence as it were.  And so, glancing at the way the others were carrying their forks and knives, Kurama reached down and did the same, and; quickly putting two and two together, dug his fork into the breast portion of his Cuccoo and with his knife, cut out a decent piece of white meat, which he proceeded to stick into his eager and curious maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter already knew first hand how great roasted Cuccoo was, but nevertheless, watched the kits' face, curious to see his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLow and behold, the young Kurama's eyes widened and his face lit up, utterly astounded.  Naruto grinned eagerly, \"Heh, that good, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping down his piece of white meat, the kit beamed and exclaimed, \"That...was the <i>yummiest</i> piece of meat I've ever eaten!\"  Smiling, Hunter reached over and ruffled the kits' head and turned to the others.  \"Well, you heard the little guy, let's dig in!\" the anthro exclaimed, as he and the others wasted no time tearing into the roasted Cuccoos and taking their first bites.  Like Kurama, both Naruto and Kiba's faces lit up, even Akamaru was astounded by the rush of flavor.  \"H-holy crap...\" Naruto muttered.  \"The seasonings, the spices, the herbs...all of it...just the right amount...i-it tastes freaking PERFECT!\" Kiba blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru licked his chops after gulping down a hearty piece of dark meat and nodded enthusiastically.  <i>What he said!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter also found himself impressed with the flavor.  He'd tasted this particular plate before and knew how wonderful it tasted, but even last time, it wasn't <i>this</i> perfectly seasoned.  <i>Wow, whoever Anju's chef is, knows what he's doing in there...</i> the wolf thought before digging in for more, right alongside the others.</span></div></div>",

Nodding in return, Hunter tilted the pitcher forward, pouring the bubbly liquid into the cup. \"That good?\" he asked, once he'd filled it a little past half-way. At the kit's nod, Hunter straightened the pitcher back up and began filling up his own cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did so, Kurama held up his own cup, examining it. <i>So...this is soda...</i> He tilted his head, ears twitching a bit. It was a lot different-looking than water; for one, it was completely dark, not see-through at all, and it fizzed and bubbled noticeably. The kit gulped, a little nervous. <i>I-it's bubbling almost like Son's lava...</i> The young Nine-Tails shuddered, remembering the time Shukaku had dared him to dip one of his tails into the Four-Tail's lava. He'd cried a lot, and it had taken <i>weeks</i> for the fur on his tail to grow completely back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama shook his head. <i>N-no; the lava was really hot, and this feels cold. 'Sides, Ms Anju seems nice; she wouldn't give us anything that'd hurt us....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping again, and determined not to lose his nerve, Kurama lifted his cup up to his muzzle, and took a single, cautious sip. Naruto, having noticed this even as he dug into his Cuccoo, looked up at the kit and grinned. \"So? How is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama set his glass back on the table, smacking his lips a little bit. \"It's...\" he began, inwardly marveling at the bubbly sensation it left on his tongue, and the fizzy feeling it produced as it flowed down his throat. \"It feels kinda funny in my mouth and goin' down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his face split in a wide, toothy grin. \"...but it's really, really sweet and yummy!\" Licking his lips eagerly, he picked his glass back up and began guzzling it down in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Naruto playfully winked back at him. \"Heh; told ya you'd like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, Kurama had completely depleted his glass. Setting it down, he licked his muzzle, giggling. \"That was the yummiest drink I've ever drunk!\" He exclaimed gleefully. Grabbing his glass again, he lifted it up toward Hunter. \"Mr. Hunter, can I have some more soda please?\" He thought for a moment. \"And can ya fill it all thte way, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Hunter grabbed the pitcher again and obliged, topping off the little creature's glass. \"There ya go, little fella; enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, too happy to oblige, lifted his glass back up and, to the astonishment of all present, managed to down the whole thing in a single go. \"Aaaaah,\" he sighed, setting the empty glass back down. \"That's good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his eyes flew open. Kiba, noticing this, frowned. \"H-hey, you OK, fuzzball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama nodded absently, resting a hand over his belly. \"Y-yeah, I'm OK; my tummy's just feeling kinda weird, like it's all fizzy and full of bubbles...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had those words left his muzzle than his cheeks bulged, his mouth flew wide open....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....and he let loose with a surprisngly long, loud belch. Naruto, Kiba, Hunter, and Akamaru all stared at him, mouths gaping open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blushed wildly, both paws flying to his muzzle. \"U-um, 'scuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them said anythingfor a moment. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Naruto suddenly burst into laughter. \"H-ha! Good one, Kurama!\" he managed through his snickers. Soon, Kiba followed him, then Hunter, then Akamaru...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama watched all of them, utterly confused as to why they were laughing. Still, a smile began tugging at the corners of his muzzle, and soon, he was laughing right alongside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their laughter began to die down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seriously, that had to be the biggest burp I've ever heard in my life!\"  Hunter chuckled and nodded with agreement.  \"Sorry, little guy, I probably should'a warned ya about ingesting so much carbonation at once, but that startled look on your face when it was over?  Priceless.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this, Kurama blushed a bit, then Naruto, a bit more lighthearted, smiled back and said, \"Still, soda tastes pretty good though, doesn't it?\"  Despite himself, Kurama beamed happily and bobbed his head up and down.  \"Yuh-huh!  I didn't even know drinks COULD taste that yummy!  Or...taste like anything at all!\"  The others laughed a bit softly at that observation from the young Tailed-Beast.  Unable to help himself, Naruto smiled warmly at the gentle creature.  There was something about seeing young Kurama so joyously discovering new things; big and small, that was just, simply uplifting.  He didn't take any of these; otherwise miniscule moments or items for granted, he appreciated each and every one of them, and seeing how happy he was trying new things, seeing new places, and meeting new people; cliche as it sounds, just warmed the boys heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat moment was interrupted however when he saw Kurama's ears droop down and an expression grow on his face that could only be described as 'uh-oh.'  Before Naruto could inquire, he and the others turned to see Anju glancing around the cafeteria with a dumbfounded look on her face.  \"Sorry to bother you, boys, but I was upstairs with my grandmother and I SWEAR I heard an angry Dodongo breaking into the cafeteria again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kiba and Akamaru glanced up at Hunter curiously.  \"Eh, it's like a dinosaur-thing,\" he said with a shrug, eliciting snickers from the trio as Kurama's face once again flushed bright red beneath his orange fur.  The kit chuckled incredibly sheepishly and nervously and said, \"Errr...t-that was me, Ms. Anju...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju turned to the kit curiously as he rubbed the back of his head and gave her an apologetic look.  \"Eh heh...I, umm...n-never had soda before, and I kinda...drank it a little too fast.  S-sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, and the surprise of the others, Anju just laughed and wiped her forehead with relief.  \"Well, that's good know!  I thought I'd have to refurnish this entire place...again!\"  Seeing the kits' face still cherry red, however, Anju smiled and approached the embarrassed young creature and gently ruffled the top of his head.  \"Don't feel embarrassed, little fella, if anything, I'm flattered!\"  At this, all five gave the red headed woman a dumbfounded look.  \"Oh, sorry, I forgot to mention, our soda's homemade.  I make it myself!  In fact, it's probably the one thing I can make that people actually LIKE consuming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter gave the woman an impressed look.  That she made the soda and it didn't taste like...well, sewage, was impressive as is, but this tasted downright delightful.  \"That's pretty neat!  But usually, isn't the homemade stuff extra thick and syrupy?\" the anthro asked, earning a chuckle and nod from Anju.  \"Typically.  But Talon; the bartender at the Milk Bar, taught me how to properly make drinks as thanks for giving him a place to stay free of charge when he locked himself out of his home again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba snickered and gave Naruto an impish glance.  \"Sounds familiar...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, stick a dog treat in it...\" responded Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju playfully scratched Kurama's long ear, making the young kit giggle warmly and making the woman smile before she took a step back and said, \"If there's anything else you boys need, just lemme know.  Otherwise, hope you enjoy!\"  With that, she once again took her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama sighed with great relief.  \"Phew...I thought she was gonna be mad at me...but she's an even nicer lady than I already thought!\"  Akamaru wagged his tail and barked in agreement.  <i>Tell me about it!  I keep expecting her to come back nursing an injured animal back to health!</i>  Hunter laughed and nodded in agreement.  \"Yeah, she's great.  I'm glad things worked out for her and Kafei in the end...\"  Internally, the wolf was scowling angrily.  <i>And to think, that miserable dirtbag Sakon had the nerve to steal their wedding mask and even try to lock Kafei in his hideout forever...eh, whatever, least he got what he deserved...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking that thought off, he smiled happily, once again being greeted by the zesty scent of Cuccoo.  \"Well, boys, how about we get back to giving these birds a nice home?\"  At this, Kurama smiled wide and said, \"Heehee, you mean our tummies?\"  Hunter nodded and playfully pet the kits' head, earning a happy giggle from the youth.  \"You know it, kiddo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Hunter, Kurama, Naruto and Akamaru immediately dove right back into their birds.  Kiba, on the other hand, grabbed his pitcher and, with some struggling, much to Hunter's amusement, poured himself a cup of soda, then said, \"Y'know, Kurama, the other thing that was really awesome was seeing how fast you managed to gulp down all that soda at once.\"  At this, Kurama gulped down a hearty mouthful of white meat and smiled at the dog-nin.  \"Heehee, thanks, Kiba!  It was just so yummy that I...couldn't help myself.\"  Naruto chuckled and nodded in agreement.  \"I outta try this homemade soda stuff out for myself,\" the blonde said.  He then grabbed his cup and held it towards Hunter.  Taking the hint, the wolf chuckled and poured Naruto's cup to the brim.  However reluctant, Kurama nervously held his cup towards Hunter as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-pretty please...?\" the kit asked eagerly but nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken a bit back by the cuteness, Hunter cleared his throat and forced a smile.  \"B-but of course!\" he said and poured the kit a drink, near the brim again.  \"Thanks, Mister Hunter!\" Kurama said gratefully, taking a cautious and mild sip, giggling gleefully as he felt that familiar, bubbly sensation slide down his throat, then resumed digging into his bird.  Looking away, Hunter pounded his chest and gasped slightly.  <i>Oh great beard of Odin!  How can something be THAT naturally adorable?  How I say?!  HOW?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again oblivious, Kiba nudged Naruto and, a bit mischievously, added, \"Like I was sayin', I ain't ever seen no one drink soda that fast before.  But I bet I can wolf this cup down pretty close to that speed.\"  Naruto snorted and said, \"Pfft, as if.  I could gulp my cup down WAY faster than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?  Then put your money where your mouth is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That a challenge, dog breathe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet your dumb ass it is, dumbass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, and never once taking his maw off the delicious bird.  Akamaru chuckled to himself, tail wagging as he did.  <i>Heeeeere we go...again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than that, both boys clutched their cups and immediately started guzzling the contents of their respective cups down...</span></div></div>",

Thin rivulets of the liquid ran down the sides of their mouths, but neither paid it any mind, instead glaring at each other as they guzzled their fizzy drinks. <i>Wow, they're both drinking it so fast,</i> Kurama thought, forking a large piece of white meat into his mouth as he watched. <i>Wonder who's gonna finish first...</i> The kit suddenly giggle, even as he chewed. <i>Well, whoever wins, bet they're gonna be burpin' really loud...</i> The young Nine-Tails swallowed, grabbing his own cup of soda and taking a sip, giggling as he did so. <i>Heehee, it's so fizzy and bubbly!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnorant of Kurama's musings, Naruto and Kiba continued gulping away, each eager to finish first. Naruto narrowed his eyes as he glared at Kiba. <i>No way in hell am I gonna let us tie again!</i> the boy thought, guzzling away. Kiba, in turn, scowled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm not gonna let this idiot win!</i> Kiba thought determinedly, tilting his glass back further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru glanced up from his Cuccoo to glance at the two. <i>Oh wow, looks like they're at about the same pace,</i> the dog noted, wagging his tail. <i>Probably gonna be another tie...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, ripping off a piece of drumstick, smiled. <i>Wow, it looks like it's gonna be really close; wonder if they're gonna tie again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama continued to watch eagerly, swishing his tails a bit. \"Keep going, Naruto!\" the kit piped, grinning. \"You're doin' great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Naruto diverted his attention to the kit, eagerly leaning forward in his seat. Though unable to say anything (as he was still drinking,) the boy smiled warmly at his fuzzy friend. <i>Heh, don't you worry, Kurama; dog-breath doesn't stand a chance!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as he'd been smiling at Kurama, he'd slowed up a bit on his cola consumption. Kiba, having still been focused on his soda, noticed this...and smirked. <i>Heh, keep your eye on the ball, Naruto...</i> Eyes gleaming, he tilted his glass even further back, guzzling down the liquid as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, sensing something off, looked to the side...and spluttered as he saw Kiba chugging away. <i>Wh-what?! How the hell did he get ahead of me?!</i> Scowling, he redoubled his efforts, attempting to regain his lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama shrank back in his seat a bit, ears wilting. This was not lost on Hunter, who glanced over him with concern. \"You OK there, kiddo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama nodded. \"Y-yeah; it's just, well, I just wanted to cheer Naruto on, and he fell behind 'cause of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled warmly at the kit. \"If you're worried he's gonna be mad if he loses, don't be; he knows you're a great little fella.\"  He winked at the young fox. \"Besides, it's all in good fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smiled bashfully, blushing a bit beneath his fur. \"I-I guess you got a point, Mr. Hunter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Naruto and Kiba continued chugging away, and despite Naruto's best efforts, Kiba maintained his lead. Naruto, noticing this, scowled, and chugged faster and faster. Hunter, Kurama, and Akamaru found themselves riveted, eager to see who would finish first. Faster and faster they guzzled, and lower and lower the amount of cola in their respective cups became, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, that was good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto lowered his nearly-depleted cup to gape at Kiba, the young dog-nin emptying the last view drops of soda into his mouth and slamming it to the counter. <i>N-no way!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba licked his lips, fixing Naruto with a triumphant smirk. \"Ah, don't be like that, Naruto; you shoulda known you couldn't beat my speed.\" He folded his arms, his smirk growing even more cheeky. \"You were doomed from the start!\" The dog-nin let out a rather loud belch, but rather than blush, he rubbed his stomach contentedly. \"Ahh, there we go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glared at his friend. \"Hey, I woulda won if I hadn't been distracted...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Naruto glanced over at Kurama, who had once again shrunk back in his chair, his ears lowering. Almost immediately, his annoyance vanished. \"H-hey, what's wrong, buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama gulped. \"W-well, it's just, if I hadn't cheered you on, you wouldn'ta been distracted, and you mighta won.\" Then, to Naruto's shock, the kit hung his head in shame. \"I-I'm sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, concerned, opened his muzzle to reassure the kit that he hadn't done anything wrong, but Naruto beat him to it. \"What're ya sorry for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh?\" Hesitantly, Kurama lifted his head up to look back at Naruto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, seeing he had the kit's attention, grinned. \"You really think I'd be mad that you were cheering for me?\" He shrugged. \"Hell, it's my own fault I slowed down; you don't have anything to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit blinked, a small, hopeful smile coming to his muzzle. \"...really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Naruto leaned forward in his chair. \"Of course; you're my buddy, aren't ya?\" As he said this, he raised an arm up and reached it across the table, clenching his hand into a fist. <i>Hope he at least knows what to do...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Kurama, after staring hesitantly at the fist, smiled and reached his own fist across the table, bumping his with Naruto's . \"Of course I am!\" the kit replied, his smile becoming a full-on beam. \"And you're my buddy too, Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, Kiba, and Akamaru watched this exchange, more than a little touched. <i>Wow, they've really become tight in just a couple days, haven't they?</i> Akamaru woofed, looking up at Kiba. Chuckling, the dog-nin scratched Akamaru's fuzzy head. \"They sure have, pal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his head away, Kiba scowled a bit. <i>S'not fair Kurama can't stay like this forever,</i> the dog-nin thought. <i>He shouldn't hafta go back to being a monster...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter noticed this and winced, having an idea of what was going through Kiba's head. Eager to change the subject, he grinned and said, \"Not to butt in, but we still got a lotta these birdies left; wouldn't want 'em to go cold, would we?\" Then, to emphasize, he dug back into his own Cuccoo. Seeing this, the four youths grinned and did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As if reinvigorated with newfound hunger, all five resumed tearing into their roasted Cuccoos like nobodies business.  Tearing at the drumsticks, to forking down ample, juicy chunks of white meat as well.  As they did, Kurama glanced at his drink, his Cuccoo, and then...down at the peas and mashed potatoes.  Still screwing his muzzle with disapproval, he stuck his tongue at the 'dreaded' veggies, but then stopped and thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter had assured him the Cuccoo would be delicious, and it was beyond one of the yummiest meats he'd ever tasted.  Then Naruto assured him he'd like soda, and it was not only sweet and yummy, but bubbly and fizzy and felt really tingly and funny going down his throat and into his tummy.  So, no matter how much the young kit may have absolutely detested the very idea of veggies on his fork, Hunter and Ms. Anju both assured him that these peas would be yummy too, and Ms. Anju was a really nice lady, she wouldn't lie, neither would Hunter, who even suggested he add them to his mashed potatoes.  And so, despite himself, he mustered a bit of courage and proceeded to mix his peas in with his mashed potatoes.  Seeing this, Hunter stopped for a moment and glanced curiously at the young kit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, takin' my advice, eh, kiddo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled softly and nodded, still admittedly a bit nervous, since he'd always gagged anytime he ever tried to have veggies.  \"I still think all veggies are icky...b-but you said these would taste better, especially mixed with the mashed potatoes, so...t-time to see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit gulped nervously as he took a forkful of peas laden mashed potatoes, earning the attention of the other three youths as they saw the young Tailed-Beast slowly raise his fork to his muzzle, and reluctantly, open wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba turned towards Naruto and nudged him slightly with his elbow.  \"Pssst, least if he don't like 'em, it'll be hilarious, right?\" Kiba whispered, earning snickers from both Naruto and Akamaru.  Hunter, on the other hand, just watched with confidence as the kit slowly bit down on the contents of his fork, pulled the fork away, and ever so slowly, started chewing with an initially pained and reluctant squinting expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, his chewing softened, and his eyes widened, earning a smirk from Hunter as Kurama continued chewing with an almost curious look on his face.  Then, he gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how were those 'icky' peas, kiddo?\" Hunter asked, already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to confirm this, the kit's muzzle formed a hesitant smile.  \"They...a-actually...tasted, really, really....really yummy!\"  The others gaped with surprise, admittedly, neither one having touched their veggies either.  \"They are?\" Naruto asked, legitimately curious as the kit bobbed his head up and down, and immediately dove in for another forkful, now adding it with a piece of white meat.  \"Yuh-huh!  Like, it's all warm and buttery and salted just right!  And added to the mashed potatoes, it just tastes like pure yummy-ness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru snickered to himself at that last remark, but proceeded to lap some peas down and beam himself.  <i>Well, I'll be!  He's dead on the money with these peas!</i>  Hearing that, Kiba took a forkful himself, gulped it down and lit up.  \"Holy crap, these taste great!  I think I can even taste a bit'uh lemon pepper too!\"  Naruto; not one to be left out, proceeded to join them, face lighting up in the same way as the others as they all proceeded to wolf down their peas and mashed spuds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just folded his arms behind his head and leaned back, smiling as he did.  \"And <i>that</i> is why you don't doubt the wolf, boys.\"  And in no time at all, he proceeded to resume wolfing down his meal right alongside his (currently) younger companions.  It was an ample amount of food to be consumed in one go, but the sheer surplus of flavor brought from everything; be it the Cuccoo, the peas, the mashed potatoes, and even the soda, it all just too good for anyone to want to slow down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as more and more of their meals began to deplete, gradually, all their tummies started to really show just how much all five were putting away.  By the time their plates and birds had all been picked bone dry, Naruto, Kiba, Kurama and Hunter's stomachs had all rounded out into a noticeable bulge within their shirts; shirts which just <i>barely</i> contained their larger stomachs.  Little Akamaru's tummy had rounded out to where it looked like the pup had swallowed a whole grapefruit.  But not a single one minded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtterly satisfied, all four leaned back and sighed happily while Akamaru rested on the table besides Kiba, letting his tongue stick out happily as he rested on his side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh man,\" sighed Naruto happily as he rubbed his belly with content, \"that was a helluva meal...\"  Hunter chuckled and gave the boy a wink.  \"Not too shabby for your first taste'uh Terminan cuisine, huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama licked his chops and nodded merrily, giving his own bloated belly a few happy pats, which once again, inadvertently caused Kurama to burp rather loudly.  Once again, the young Kyuubi blushed and excused himself, clamping a paw over his mouth a bit sheepishly, but Naruto just snickered and playfully reached over and nudged the kits' shoulder.  \"Ah, c'mon, buddy, don't be embarrassed.  Trust me, around us, you can cut as loose as ya like.\"  To emphasize this point, Naruto thumped his fist into his chest and let out a much louder belch, grinning childishly afterwards.  \"Ahh, see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit giggled with amusement, then, seeing Naruto's silly smile, burst into a fit of laughter.  \"Heehee, that was awesome!\"  Kurama exclaimed merrily as the blonde smiled back at him and chuckled.  Kiba and Akamaru just laughed softly amongst themselves while Hunter watched the young blonde and fox kit continuing to get along so playfully and felt his heart melting, seeing their happy faces.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, Kurama rested both paws on his tummy and smiled, examining his empty plate.  \"That really WAS one of the yummiest meals I've ever had.  I can't believe how good everything tasted!\"  The kit exclaimed, earning nods of agreement table round.  \"No arguments there, Kurama,\" exclaimed Kiba, rubbing his tummy in satisfaction.  Then, Kurama's face lit up as Anju returned, smiling as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was your meal?\" the redheaded woman asked, fairly confident in their answer.  \"Yummiest meal I've ever had!\"  Kurama eagerly exclaimed, earning a chuckle from Anju as she playfully ruffled the kits head, earning a giggle from the young creature.  \"Well, I'm very glad you enjoyed yourselves,\" she said with a smile as she proceeded to grab the plates on the table.  She was about to reach for Kurama's when he grabbed it and held it up to her.  \"Here ya go, Ms Anju!  Do you need any help taking the dishes away?\" the fox kit asked, earning a warm smile from the elder woman.  \"Well, aren't you just the most adorable, well mannered, little creature I've ever met!\" she said, earning a bashful giggle from the young Tailed-Beast.  \"I appreciate the offer, but I've got it, little fella.\"  She smiled gratefully and took his plate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, before she could leave, the kit raised his paw up.  \"Ooh!  Ms. Anju?  I, umm, I was wondering...w-would it be alright if we thanked the chef in person for making such a yummy meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Anju's expression suggested some hint of reluctance, but, nevertheless, she shrugged, arms gracefully full of plates, and said, \"S-sure, he should still be in the kitchen.  Should still be there if you want to thank him, or tip him.  Just...try not to say something that'd offend him...he's...a bit sensitive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe once again thanked her customers and took her leave, leaving Hunter curious.  <i>Huh, wonder what that was about...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, he worked a smile and rose to his feet, giving his own bloated midsection a hearty pat as he said, \"Well, I, for one, am with the kid, and would love to thank the man responsible for so delightful a meal!  Shall we?\"</span></div></div>",

This bad boy's staying on for now.\" He undid his belt, holding both ends in his paws. \"Still, things are startin' to get a little tight, so I gotta make a few adjustments...\" As he said this, he brought both ends of his belt back together. Threading the leather strip through the metallic buckle, he tugged it upward a bit. Once it was threaded through to his satisfaction, he put the metal bit of the buckle through, with notably less notches below it than before. Straightening it out, he sighed. \"Ahhhh....that's better,\" the wolf muttered, giving his belly a few hearty pats. He suddenly belched, eliciting a giggle from the boys, especially Kurama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama snickered. \"Heh, 'scuse you.\" Then, before Hunter could reply, his expression brightened. \"So, can we go thank the chef now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter winked back at him. \"But of course.\" Something suddenly occurred to him. \"One thing, though; maybe I should lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scowled, folding his arms. \"Huh? How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter scratched the back of his head. \"Well, Anju said he's kinda sensitive and cranky, and as great as you all are...\" Kiba smirked at this, while Naruto and Kurama beamed happily. \"...tact isn't exactly your strong suit.\" He folded his arms behind his head. \"Don't worry, though; once I've tested the water, you can all take turns thanking him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving his belly one final pat, he strolled past the boys and indicated a direction with his paw. \"Well, boys, shall we go thank the man behind the meal?\" At the eager nods from the youths, Hunter chuckled and motioned again, leading the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they made their way to the kitchen's entrance, barred only by a wooden door that was cracked open ever-so-slightly. Smiling, Hunter opened his muzzle...but faltered as he saw Kurama almost vibrating with anticipation. <i>Wow, the little guy really wants to thank the chef, doesn't he?</i> He shrugged. <i>Well, I guess there's no harm in it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at the kit and smiled. \"Tell ya what, kid; why don't you say hi first?\" He ruffled Kurama's head. \"Cranky or not, I'm sure he'd appreciate someone who enjoyed his cooking as much as you did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned. \"Really?!\" Then, a bit less enthusiastically, he turned toward Naruto, Kiba ,and Akamaru. \"Uh, are you guys OK if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked. \"Go for it, Kurama!\" Kiba said nothing, but gave a thumbs-up while Akamaru barked his agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling warmly at them, Kurama walked up to the door and knocked softly on it. \"'Scuse me? Mr. Chef?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing for a moment. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whaddaya want, kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama recoiled, a bit taken off-guard by the chef's coarse manner. Hunter blinked, but for another reason entirely. The door had muffled the voice somewhat, but the could have sworn he'd heard it before....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama shook himself and straightened, smiling. \"S-sorry to bother you, Mister! I just wanted to thank you for such a yummy meal, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit tryin' ta butter me up, kid,\" the chef's voice called again. Naruto and Kiba gaped at the chef's rudeness. <i>Not the most friendly guy, is he?</i> Akamaru yipped. Hunter nodded his head, only half-paying attention. <i>Alright, I KNOW I've heard that guy's voice before...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened. \"I-I'm not tryin' to butter you up, Mister; I just wanted to say thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna say thanks?\" the chef replied shortly. \"Leave a tip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's smile vanished entirely, and he  slouched down. \"B-but I just...\" Then, to everyone's alarm, tears started to gather in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting aside the nagging recognition in his mind, Hunter moved to comfort Kurama, but before he could, Naruto glared at the door, balling up his fists. \"Hey, watch it, you jerk!\" the boy shouted. \"He was just trying to thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice scoffed. \"Kid, it's my job; no point in thanking me. And if your buddy has a problem, let HIM speak up about it! Little putz...\" Naruto spluttered, and Kiba's eyes narrowed as he, too, walked up to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, piss off, ya jerk! No one calls him an idiot but me!\" the young dog-nin protested, drawing an annoyed (yet somehow touched) look form the blonde. Akamaru said nothing, but simply growled. Hunter, though, was still preoccupied with the voice. <i>That voice...it almost sounds like...no, it can't be, there's no way he'd be here....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef's voice came from the door, noticeably angrier. \"You're tellin' <i>me</i> to piss off, ya little twerp?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba clenched his fists. \"You're damn right I am!\" the boy shouted. \"You wanna fight about it, or are ya too chicken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping his eyes and sniffling a bit, Kurama looked at Kiba. \"K-Kiba, c'mon, you don't have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef's irate voice sounded again. \"Yeah right! C'mon, let's me and you throw down, right here, right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened. \"G-guys, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it on!\" Naruto shouted, glaring at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter simply shook his head. <i>N-no, it can't be...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine, I'm coming out!\" The voice replied, sounding riled up. Several footsteps sounded, growing louder as they drew near the door...though the group noted the footfalls were surprisingly light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door swung wide open. \"Alright, ya buncha jackasses, ya wanted me? Here I...am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef, stepping out of the door, simply stood and stared at the children as the door swung shut behind him, specifically the young Nine-Tails wearing a shirt and pants. However, that was nothing compared to the confusion at the sight that greeted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before them was, of all things, a bipedal <i>raccoon</i>, no more than three feet in height. He wore an stained white apron that covered both his front and his back, with a fairly tall chef's hat perched between his ears. He was wearing no sleeves of any kind, and his clawed feet were similarly bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon stared at them blankly for a moment. \"What in the hell...\" he muttered, scratching one of his ears. \"What's with the weird looking Keaton...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Rocket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the faint voice, the raccoon's-Rocket's-head snapped up. \"Yeah, that's my name, what about i---HUNTER?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon's dark eyes promptly flew wide open as he laid eyes on the anthro, the wolf gaping back at him, muzzle dropping wide open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two stared at each other, Naruto nudged Kiba. \"Hey, isn't he that guy Hunter showed us earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded. \"Yeah; wonder what he's doing here...?\" Kurama, having no idea what the two were talking about, simply tilted his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither wolf nor raccoon said anything for a moment. Then, their eyes widened further, they pointed at one another, and yelled:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the HELL are you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No?  Well, til you do, I do believe <i>I</i> asked first.\" declared Rocket, earning a sigh from the anthro as he shook his head.  \"You can't use that to win EVERY argument you ever get into...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket grinned slyly and folded his arms together.  \"Helped me get outta intergalactic jury duty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the four youths just stared at this exchange, utterly dumbfounded and lost, though Kurama was still occasionally sniffing sadly from the raccoons sharp comments earlier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with an annoyed grunt, Hunter rolled his eyes and was about to answer, but Naruto gritted his teeth at the smug look on the raccoons face and marched forward.  \"How about YOU tell us what the hell your damn problem is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter winced inwardly.  He was so surprised to see Rocket not only in Termina, but working an honest job...<i>quite well in fact</i>, that he'd almost forgotten about the things Rocket said that got everything so riled up to begin with.  \"You seriously wanna start with me again, you lil punk?\" barked Rocket sharply, causing Naruto to growl angrily as he stepped closer.  \"You're damn right I do!  What kinda jerk is THAT mean to someone just trying to thank them for making something they really enjoyed?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket scoffed then turned his attention to Kurama.  \"Oh, you <i>really enjoyed</i> my cooking?  Well, <i>la-dee-freakin'-da</i>!  What, like your opinion's so important that you just GOTTA lemme know that you APPROVE 'uh my cookin'?!  You think you're better than me?!  That it, ya snooty lil Keaton brat?!  Fine.  Tell ya what, <i>your highness,</i>\"  Rocket stopped then marched over to the little coffee table near the kitchen door and grabbed a large, empty jar, labeled, 'TIPS' then placed it down before the young Tailed-Beast.  \"You wanna thank me?  You wanna brighten my day with sunshine and stinkin' roses?  THAT'S how ya do it!  Cause words ain't worth SQUAT...'specially from some funky lookin' Keaton runt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Rocket's surprisingly lengthy rant had concluded, Kurama's ears and head had lowered considerably as the young kit looked down, teary eyed.  In contrast, however, Naruto, Kiba and Akamaru were fuming, and about ready to show this raccoon the meaning of respect with their fists.  (Or in Akamaru's case; teeth)  But before things could get any worse, Anju dropped in and intervened just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the name of the Goddess is going on here?\" asked Anju as she stepped towards the heated scene.  Immediately, Naruto stepped forward and pointed a digit angrily at Rocket.  \"This guy's a total jerk!\"  Kiba nodded then said, \"Our friend just wanted to thank him for making a meal he enjoyed so much, and your chef basically told us all to piss off!\"  Anju saw the tearful and hurt expression on the young Kyuubi's once merry and joyful face, and a look of concern suddenly grew over hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter raised a paw to interject, but Rocket spoke up first.  \"ACTUALLY, I told the kid he could tip me...THEN I basically told him to piss off.\"  He then shrugged innocently and added, \"See?  Kids; can't trust their words for squat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju simply sighed.  \"Gentlemen, I'm truly sorry for this.  I should have known something like this would happen,\" she said as she turned to Rocket, looking slightly more stern as she added, \"Mr. Rocket, I thought we'd already had this discussion; you CAN'T pick fights with our customers.  I'm accommodating you and your large, wooden friend free of charge for your culinary talents and letting you keep all the tips...DESPITE the fact that you tried to convince me that you needed my grandmothers wheel chair to get around the kitchen!\"  At this Rocket turned away and did his best to retain a few snickers.  Even Hunter couldn't help but one cackle accidentally slip; admittedly always amused whenever Rocket would pull a stunt like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nevertheless, Anju concluded the sentiment by saying, \"The very least you can do is show a little respect to our customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket raised an eyebrow and said, \"Hey, it's not like they respect ME!  All I get are 'thank you's' and 'nice cookin'.'  Do you see a single stinkin' tip for the effort?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rocket could add anything further, the sound of a few items clinking against glass caught everyone's ears.  They all turned and saw Kurama reaching from his bag and dropping several blue Rupees and a purple one into the jar, still looking down as he said, \"Thank you.  Everything tasted really good.  I'm sorry for bothering you...\"  With that, Kurama turned around and slowly walked outside on all fours; shoulders slumped and ears lowered as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kiba, Akamaru, Hunter, even Anju glanced at the poor retreating creature with a mixture of concern and sympathy.  Rocket, being Rocket, was about to snort and mock cry, when he saw just what was in his jar.  <i>Wait, the blue ones are worth five a pop...and the purple one's...ain't that worth fifty...?</i> the raccoon thought.  <i>How dumb does that kid gotta be to leave a tip THAT high?  He really, liked my cookin' THAT much...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Rocket glanced back Kurama's general direction, and his previously stern expression softened a bit as he scratched the back of his head, almost a bit shamefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Ah crap...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked back up and saw all five glaring back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Double crap...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, on the other hand, was another image entirely, as Kurama sat on all fours, ears and head lowered with eyes clamped shut, and tears streaming down his cheeks.  <i>S-stupid...Ms. Anju said we should be careful bothering him...w-why couldn't I just listen...?  Why'd I hafta go and spoil the fun for everyone again...?  *Sniff*  Shukaku was right, I AM just a big...dumb...b-baby...</i>  The kit mused internally, and proceeded to sniffle more...</span></div></div>",

It wasn't like he actually thought he was better than any of the others; Kokuo was faster and physically stronger than he could ever hope to be, Isobu was the best swimmer he'd ever known, Choumei (at least according to the Old Man) would get to <i>fly</i> once he was all grown up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wh-why would Mister Rocket call me snooty?</i> Letting out another sob, he brought a foreleg up to his face and, suddenly overcome with emotion, began crying in earnest into his orange fur. <i>A-and why would he think I was sayin' I was better than he was...?</i> Another sob wracked his body, and he shook, the tears continuing to flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the black space created by his closed eyes grew darker, as though something was blocking the light. <i>H-huh?</i> Kurama thought through his cries and sniffles. <i>I-is it gettin' cloudy,?</i> Wiping his eyes and taking a few shaky breaths to get his crying down a bit, he blinked open his red, puffy eyes, shaking his head to clear the film that his tears had created over it. Sniffling, he glanced up...and his eyes promptly widened as he saw exactly <i>what</i> was blocking the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature, for that is what it was, was tall...really, really, REALLY tall, even taller than Mister Hunter...but that was not what was most surprising about it. No, it was more the fact that the creature appeared to be, for all intents and purposes, a walking tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was shaped like a person, at least-two arms, two legs, a head with eyes and a mouth-but everything other than that was totally different. Its eyes were dark, it had no nose or hair, but most shocking of all, it appeared to be made entirely out of wood, its limbs composed of thick branches that twisted together to form arms and legs. These arms were, currently, holding a rather large basket with what appeared to be assorted cooking ingredients-fruits, veggies, meats, and the like-but Kurama took no note of the specifics. No, he was focused more on the fact that the massive creature was looking down at <i>him</i>, its dark eyes studying him curiously as its head tilted a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama lost his nerve a bit, getting up and slowly backing away from the imposing tree-man. \"Wh-who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The creature studied him for a few more seconds...before its mouth slowly curled up into a smile. Then, it opened its mouth, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Groot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit shocked that the creature could talk, Kurama once again sat down, though he was still tense, ready to run at any given moment. \"H-hi, Mister G-Groot,\" the young Nine-Tails stammered. \"I-I'm Kurama...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature-Groot- nodded a bit, before, to Kurama's surprise, it bent down, set the basket on the ground, and knelt down to try to get down to his level (though he still towered well above the kit), and looked him in the eyes, smiling warmly. \"I am Groot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blinked slowly. \"N-nice to m-meet you too, Mister Groot,\" the kit replied, his unease starting to let up the tiniest bit. \"U-um, you're not gonna hurt me or anything, are you?\" At this, Groot's eyes widened a bit, before the smile returned and he nodded. Kurama sighed in relief. \"O-OK, good...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, without warning, another sob wracked his body, and he grit his teeth as more tears exited his eyes; once the shock had begun to wear off, his hurt had begun returning in full force<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot, seeing this, tilted his head. \"I am...Groot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffling, Kurama nodded. \"Y-yeah, I-I'm OK...\" He winced inwardly as another tear tracked its way down his fur, revealing the lie to his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Groot reached a hand out. Kurama's eyes widened, and he recoiled a bit...only for the hand to come rest on his shoulder (encompassing the whole thing in the process.)  \"I am Groot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama shook a bit. \"Wh-why am I crying?\" he repeated, wiping his eyes again. \"Y-you're not gonna be interested...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Groot.\" The tree-man's next utterance came out still sounding kind and caring, but oddly firm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama stared back at Groot, surprised. \"Y-you really wanna know?\" Groot nodded, the smile returning to his face. Seeing how interested the creature was, Kurama couldn't help but smile a bit himself, even as tears continued tracing down his fur. \"W-well, my friends and I just had a really, really, yummy meal, and we went to thank the chef, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot's eyes widened for a moment before his shoulders slumped and he sighed. \"I am Groot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama gaped. \"Y-you know Mister Rocket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot nodded. \"I am...Groot.\" he replied, sounding oddly resigned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened. \"Y-you're his friend?\" Groot nodded again, still looking resigned, but he could not quite help but smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama sniffed again. \"Th-then...can you tell me why he was so mean to me n' my friends?\" Before Groot could reply, the kit found himself continuing. \"I-I mean, I just wanted to thank him 'cause it was the yummiest meal I ever ate, but he yelled at me 'n called me snooty...\" Kurama's body shook as the sniffles intensified. \"...a-an' he said that thanks don't mean anything, a-and that I thought I was better than him...\" he sobbed a bit, the tears coming in stronger. \"...a-an' that we didn't respect him, a-and that I was a runt, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit gasped as a vine slowly extended from Groot's body, reaching for his face. He jerked a bit,  but his fear became surprise as it slowly reached up to his eyes and wiped a few tears away, the tree-man smiling warmly all the while. \"I am Groot,\" he said softly. Kurama gaped, awed at the sheer kindness the creature was treating him with even though they'd only just met. He looked up toward the entrance of the inn. \"I am Groot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened. \"Y-you're gonna talk to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot nodded. \"I...am Groot.\" Then, to Kurama's surprise, he smiled, reached out...and seized the fox kit. The kit yelped a bit as he was placed gently on the hulking creature's shoulder. Once Kurama was securely in place, Groot nodded and stood back up. He looked at the befuddled fox kit. \"I am Groot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, still a bit confused, nonetheless managed a smile. \"Y-yeah; let's go...\" Nodding and smiling, Groot headed inside, the kit still perched on his shoulder....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kurama, upon hearing the fighting intensify, shrunk a bit atop his 'seat', which Groot sensed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...am Groot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit looked down shamefully and replied, \"W-well, Ms. Anju warned us that Mister Rocket was cranky...a-and my f-friends were having fun, until I-\"   The massive creature just smiled warmly as a vine formed besides Kurama and gently ruffled the top of the kits' fuzzy orange head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Groot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Kurama glanced back towards Groot, almost hopefully and replied, \"...Y-you really don't think I did anything wrong...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wood-man smiled warmly and nodded his head firmly.  Kurama smiled gratefully, until the sound of something shattering startled them both.  Kurama gulped nervously as the two headed onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the cafeteria, Rocket was standing atop of a large wooden box.  Besides it, a shattered vase.  \"How's THAT for temper tantrum?!\" barked Rocket furiously.  Surprisingly, Anju smirked then glanced back at the others as she leaned down and whispered.  \"Don't worry, I keep those for stress release.  Been doing it ever since I heard there was a kid running into everyone's stores and shattering their vases...\"  Hunter couldn't help but smirk but the three youths were not the least bit amused.  Akamaru growled as he glared up at Rocket.  <i>You're lucky you're up there, or else I'd be chewing off your-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped mid sentence as something caught the side of his eye.  He turned and immediately yipped frightfully, startling everyone.  Kiba looked down at his canine puppy pal with concern and said, \"W-what is it, b-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Akamaru, he and Naruto both saw what had spooked his pup...a large...REALLY large wooden man-thing, carrying a basket of ingredients, and perched atop his shoulder; Kurama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn unison, both boys gaped as Naruto scratched the back of his head and asked, \"Errr...m-makin' new friends, Kurama...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket on the other hand, just held his arms out and said, \"Bout freakin' time!  I thought that old fat guy from the Carnival tried to make ya int'uh LUMBER again!\"  But Groot simply smiled and shook his head, ever gently releasing Kurama back down towards the floor to head back with his friends.  Hunter glanced at the young fox kit with concern and asked, \"H-how ya feeling, kiddo...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama wiped a few tears from his face, but nonetheless, worked a smiled and said, \"A little better, thanks to Mr. Groot.\"  The boys once again gaped and; in unison, asked, \"Groot...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" interrupted Rocket as he held one paw towards the group then back at Groot.  \"Groot?  Meet jerkwads.  Jerkwads?  Meet Groot.\"  Hunter gave the raccoon a stern glance, but the others were too in awe at the sight of a walking tree-man to pay any heed to Rocket's rude remarks.  \"Errr, h-hi, Groot,\" said Naruto nervously.  Groot simply smiled and said, \"I am Groot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys stared in silence for a moment, as Kiba added, \"Y-yeah, we know, your jerk-ass friend just told us-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who you callin' jerkass, ya little crap?  Huh?!  How about I smash this next-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am Groot!\"</i> remarked the tree-man, rather firmly, catching Rocket's attention, and leaving the others dumbfounded.  Even more so when Kurama nodded in agreement and said, \"H-he's right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru tilted his head curiously.  <i>He's right that his name is Groot...?  Y-yeah, I would imagine so...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just smirked and shook his head.  \"No, no, see, Groot's speech is...shall we say...limited.  You can ask him anything and his answer will always be 'I am G-\"  He stopped mid-sentence as another thought entered his mind, and immediately, Hunter turned his attention to Kurama.  \"W-wait, you UNDERSTOOD him...?\"  The kit bobbed his head up happily.  \"Yuh huh!  Sure did!  He talked to me outside, said he'd talk to Rocket and try and calm him down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to this, Groot and Rocket continued conversing amongst themselves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.  Am.  Groot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whadduya mean I gotta calm down?!  I'm PERFECTLY freakin' calm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>am</i> Groot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, maybe I AM a little pissed off, so what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Groot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dammit!  Maybe the Keaton kid didn't say anything THAT bad, but his jerkwad buddies-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot pointed back at Hunter curiously, earning a reluctant wave from the anthro.  \"Yeah, good to see you too, big guy...\"  He said.  Groot smiled, then leaned back towards Rocket and, surprisingly quiet, asked, \"I am <i>Groot</i>...?\"  Rocket shrugged and replied, \"Beats me.  He was about tuh tell me what he was doin' here with these annoying runts, but then the runts decided to be EXTRA annoying cause I was 'being too mean' to the Keaton kid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am...Groot...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, yeah, maybe I WOULD be pissed if someone were talkin' smack bout'chu 'er Quill 'er Gamora...DEFINITELY not Drax, but-t-that's different!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Groot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it just IS, okay?!  I...I dunno.  Maybe it ISN'T...but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...am Groot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket stopped for a moment, then sighed, shaking his head lowly.  \"No, if someone made you feel the way I made the Keaton bra...Keaton KID feel...I wouldn't show 'em any respect either...fact, I'd probably zap 'em'n beat 'em stupid with robotic arm I snagged from that blond kid in whatchumacallit, hehe...\"  Groot glanced down and raised what would be an eyebrow in mild disapprovement.  Rocket just snickered and said, \"Whaaaat?  His friend made him a NEW one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Groot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, y-yeah, maybe them gettin' pissed at me WASN'T completely uncalled for...b-but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Groot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, cause the fox kid didn't just tell me off HIMSELF!  What, he didn't have the nerve to tell me off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I am Groot</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Genuinely hurt...?</i>  The hell does that-\" Rocket stopped for a moment then looked back at the kit, still a bit teary eyed from the entire exchange, then back at his tip jar, and recalled him leaving after thanking and tipping him...how it could only be described as 'broken spirited'.  Then, the raccoon sighed, lowering his head a bit shamefully.  \"...Guess I DID get kinda carried away again, didn't I...b-but I mean come on, I didn't think people could like my freakin' cookin' THAT much...thought he was just pretendin' tuh give a crap...didn't think he was being serious...but...but I mean, come on...can ya blame me?  How many times people come to thank me, see me, and call for pest control'er somethin'?  They wanna praise me til they actually see me, then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am Groot?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, no, the kid didn't react that way, he even tipped me...good tip too, and I guess...h-his stupid buddies didn't care either, just that I was being a complete...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon scoffed to himself and shook his head.  \"Heh...guess I CAN be kind of a jerkass, huh...\"  Then; like before, Groot leaned down towards his fuzzy friend and placed an arm atop Rocket's shoulder gently as he smiled warmly at the raccoon.  \"I, <i>am</i> Groot...\"  Despite himself, Rocket smirked and looked back up at Groot.  \"Heh, ah ya big sap...you too, pal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to either of them; with the exception of Kurama, everyone else simply gaped, utterly dumbfounded at the conversation that had just transpired.  \"I think I just got dumber...\" remarked Naruto, utterly deadpanned.  Kiba; without even paying the blonde any heed, uttered, \"Not possible, bonehead...\" never taking his eyes off the scene.  Kurama, despite himself, couldn't help but giggle as saw his friends and Anju all looking so silly in their confusion.  His smirk immediately faded however, when he found himself face to face with Rocket once again.  To his surprise, the raccoon didn't appear angry, rather, he had a fairly guilty look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, kid, I....I know I kinda blew up at'cha'n said some things that...well, MIGHT be considered...meanersomethin'...and...well, point'uh this whole, short term conversin' and, uhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit simply tilted his head in utter confusion, as did the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yup...I'm definitely feeling a brain cell or two calling it quits here,\" muttered Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Rocket sighed, and a bit more somberly, said, \"...It ain't easy bein' different, kid.  People look down at ya, make ya feel like less than ya are.  I guess, ya spend so much time thinkin' y'er nuthin' that when someone says ya ain't, ya don't...really...believe 'em, or maybe, ya just get tired'uh tryin'.  I dunno...all I know is, I acted like an ass' ass...and, I'm...I'm sorry.  Really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mixed looks of confusion and anger subsided, softening a bit as the raccoon seemed genuinely apologetic...and not about to smash a vase into anyone's face.  Meanwhile, Kurama; still admittedly hurt, nodded softly and fiddled his front paws together as he looked back at Rocket warmly and said,  \"I'm sorry too...no one should ever look down on someone for being different.  That's not fair.  Because...i-if a person is good, then that's all that should matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's previously angry expression, became a bit more sympathetic, like Rocket, he too, knew that pain all too well, but to hear Kurama say that, so genuinely to someone who had verbally lashed him out earlier, brought a warm smile to his face, along with Groot, who nodded at the kit approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the kit smiled a bit warmly at the raccoon and; to Rocket's surprise, held his paw out as he said, \"I heard the Old Man say this once...errr, <i>l-let beegones be...gones</i>...I think.\"  Despite himself, Rocket chuckled, nodding as he reached out and shook the kit's paw.  \"Swing'n uh miss, but...thanks, kid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then glanced back at the others.  \"Look, I'm sorry I acted the way I did.  I was...kinda outta line, and-well, i-if there's any way I can make it up to you run-errr, kids, and ol' wolfy there, just, say the word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group thought for a moment...</span></div></div>",

Couldn't tell...\" Kurama said nothing, but poked at his belly through his flame spiral shirt, giggling at its roundness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled warmly at the kit, before turning his attention back toward Rocket. \"...but since it'll probably take a while, what kinda desserts can you bake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket raised an eyebrow at the question, having just noticed their rounded tummies (and wondering if he'd need to do a Milk Bar run,) but nonetheless smirked. \"Pffft, you serious? Compared to cooking, baking's the easiest damn thing in the world!\" Rocket folded his arms and looked at the ceiling. \"Now let's see, what can I make...oh yeah! There's cakes, pies, souffles, cookies, muffins...\" He looked back at the others and smirked. \"Take yer pick; I can bake damn near anything ya want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kiba, and Kurama's eyes all lit up. \"R-really...? An-anything we want...?\" Naruto said in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket nodded. \"Yep; you name it, I'll bake it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Naruto opened his mouth to answer, but Kiba beat him to it. \"How about some pies?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket nodded. \"Pies; sounds goo--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on just a second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket raised an eyebrow as Naruto  shouldered up next to Kiba and glared at him. The dog-nin pulled back, scowling. \"What the hell's your problem, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto slugged Kiba in the shoulder. \"My PROBLEM is that you just butted the hell in without seeing what any of us wanted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shoved Naruto back a bit. \"Well, what the hell's wrong with pie?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shoved Kiba back. \"MAYBE I feel more like cake!\" Scowling, the dog-nin shoved Naruto back. Then Naruto shoved Kiba, Kiba shoved Naruto...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama watched the two go at it, a bit concerned, but not overly so; he'd gotten to know them well enough that this was just how they interacted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Groot?\" Ears perking, Kurama looked up at Groot, who was looking at the two boys with a mixture of befuddlement and concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nine-Tails giggled. \"Nah, it's OK, Mr. Groot; they do this all the time...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tree-man still looked a bit confused, but nodded and continued watching the boys. The two continued arguing and shoving each other, earning a worried look from Hunter and, surprisingly, a smile from Rocket. <i>Heh, I mighta misjudged these kids; I like 'em better already...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, he chose this moment to speak up. \"Um, kids?\" Naruto and Kiba, fistfuls of each others' shirts (or sleeveless hoodie, in Naruto's case) clenched in their hands, glanced back toward Rocket. Seeing he had their attention, the raccoon cleared his throat. \"You <i>do</i> realize I can make both, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the both of them blinked, then looked back at each other. \"...Oh,\" Naruto finally said, releasing Kiba's shirt. Laughing nervously as Kiba did the same to his hoodie, he turned back toward Rocket and laughed nervously, rubbing the back of his head. \"S-sorry; didn't think of that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba rolled his eyes, even as he straightened his shirt out. \"You're such an idiot...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket scoffed. \"Hate to break it to ya, kid, but you ain't exactly a genius either; I saw ya arguin' just the same as he was.\" Kiba glared at Rocket, face reddening a bit, but a whine from Akamaru got him to stand down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Rocket continued. \"Alright, so cakes and pies...anybody else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter tentatively raised a paw. \"Erm, now that you're asking...maybe some cookies and muffins? Don't really care which flavors they are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket nodded. \"Mmhmm, so cakes, pies, cookies, muffins...\" As the small creature rattled off the list, Groot looked at him curiously. That sounded like an awful lot....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill looking at the others, Rocket looked toward the kit. \"So, erm, kid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me Kurama,\" the young creature replied cheerily, beaming at the raccoon. A bit taken off guard, Rocket shook his head and continued on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Kurama,\" the raccoon continued, \"anything in particular ya want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama thought for a moment. \"Umm...I know it's not really something that's baked, but could you maybe make something with ice cream?\" The kit brightened, his tails swishing eagerly. \"I really like ice cream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Groot's surprise, Rocket nodded. \"Ice cream; got it!\" He looked amongst the five travelers. \"Any more requests?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised that the previously grouchy creature was being so agreeable, Akamaru nonetheless decided to take a chance. <i>Umm...I dunno if you can understand me, but could we maybe have some donuts too?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his relief, the raccoon nodded. \"Gotcha!\" He held a hand up. \"Alright, so lemme see if I got this right...\" He ticked off each request on a digit. \"Cakes, pies, cookies, muffins, somethin' with ice cream, and doughnuts. That sound about right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than a bit surprised that Rocket wasn't complaining or snarking at them,  Hunter nonetheless managed a nod. \"Y-yeah, that's everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blinked, tilting his head. \"A-are you sure you're OK makin' all that, Mister Rocket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket shrugged. \"Eh, place is pretty dead anyways, and I didn't have any real plans for the night, 'cept maybe hittin' the Milk Bar...ain't no big deal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned. \"Thanks, Mister Rocket!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket recoiled a bit, taken a bit off guard by the thanks and just how <i>sincere</i> it sounded, but quickly recomposed himself. \"Yeah, well...\" He shook his his head. \"A-anyways, its probably gonna be a while, so feel free to screw around, look around town, whatever the hell you feel like doin'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled, patting his still-rounded belly. \"Well, its probably a good idea to work off the Cuccoos while we have the chance.....\" He looked down at his young companions. \"What do you kids feel like doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama waved a front leg in the air. \"Ooh! Ooh! Can we go play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed, ruffling the kit's head. \"Sure! I think there are a few parks here in Clock Town, too; nice and spacious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kurama looked toward Naruto and Kiba. \"You guys OK with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Yeah, I'm always up for runnin' around.\" Akamaru eagerly barked his agreement. Naruto grinned back at Kurama. \"Sounds good, buddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama beamed. \"Great! I'll race you guys!\" Then, before any of them could react, he rushed toward the exit, running out the door. A bit befuddled, Naruto and Kiba nonetheless grinned and rushed after him, laughing merrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju, Rocket, Groot, and Hunter watched as they left. \"Soooo....\" Rocket began, scratching his ear. \"How long ya think it'll take 'em to figure out they don't know where the hell they're going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled. \"Hopefully we won't have to find out.\" Smiling, he strolled toward the exit after the youths. Before he exited, though, he looked back at the others. \"By the way, Rocket, thanks; that's really nice of ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket shrugged nonchalantly. \"Eh, like I said, I don't got anythin' better to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled to himself. <i>Sure, that's it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut loud, he said, \"Well, see ya later, Rocket!\" With that, he headed off, following the shouts and shrieks of laughter from the youths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the wolf was gone, Anju turned toward Rocket, more than a bit confused. \"Mr. Rocket, what was that all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot nodded in agreement, looking down at his diminutive companion. \"I am...Groot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket smirked. \"Eh, like I said, I kinda owed that kid after yellin' at him like that.\" He shrugged. \"Plus, it'll give me an excuse to hit the Milk Bar afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot tilted his head. \"I am Groot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket rolled his eyes. \"So I won't hafta watch them stuffin' their guts, that's why!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot blinked quizzically. \"I am Groot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket scowled. \"I don't <i>care</i> that their guts go back to normal afterwards! It's. WEIRD.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju, though only catching half of the conversation, nonetheless spoke up as something occurred to her. \"Mr. Rocket...exactly how much were you planning on making?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Rocket turned around, looked up at her...and gave a rather alarming grin. \"Groot,\" he began, still grinning at Anju, \"bring a few tables in here.\" His eyes gleamed. \"We're going all out!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hunter continued wandering down the town and smirked as he saw his young pals chasing after each other, and heading straight into North Clocktown; a section practically DESIGNED for youths, with its' ample playfield, mini-hills, sizable trees, grassy spots, and more important than any of that...a rather large slide.  Hunter glanced up at it and smirked to himself.  \"Oh ho ho mama...now if only I had a Goron Mask...that'd launch me into rolling around for <i>hours.</i>..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Hunter, the boys continued racing in a close neck race, eventually reaching the center of the small field, panting and laughing merrily.  \"Heehee!  Wow wee, that was fun!\" young Kurama exclaimed merrily, catching his breath as he did.  Naruto; whose face was particularly dirty, smirked and gave the kit a friendly nudge in the shoulder.  \"Heh, you said it, buddy!  I forgot how fast you are on all four!\"  The kit simply giggles and rubbed the back of his head bashfully.  Then the blond turned his attention to his dog-nin pal and grinned mischievously.  \"But you?  Man, those birds must'uh added some pounds, cause you were slugging around like a...slug!\"  Kiba scowled and barked, \"Oh, shut up!  Least I didn't trip over my own two feet!\"  Naruto scowled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey!  There was a stinkin' branch in the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There weren't any trees, you bonehead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?  W-well, that didn't stop me from beating you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We.  TIED...again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stopped for a moment and tilted his head.  \"..<i>.Again</i>...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moment passed, then the two boys burst into a fit of exhausted sounding laughter.  Akamaru snickered to himself as he playfully nudged Kurama.  <i>Yeah, they tied all right...tied for last place, cause I smoked them too!</i>  Kurama giggled as well, until the sight of the slide caused his eyes to widen with wonder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping his face, Naruto turned his attention to Kurama, and was about to open his mouth when he saw what his fox kit buddy was 'whoa-ing' about.  Kiba and Akamaru looked up and immediately gaped at the sheer size of the slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is that...?\" Kurama asked, still gaping.  Grinning, Naruto wrapped his arm around the kits shoulder as though an older brother to a little brother and said, \"<i>That</i>, my friend, is called a slide.  You climb all the way up, and it slides you all the way down.  Wanna see?\"  The kit immediately bobbed his head as Kiba grinned and stepped forward, picking up Akamaru and sticking him atop his head as he turned to Kurama and said, \"Observe, fuzzy.\"  He proceeded to climb the ladder, going higher and higher until reaching the very top.  \"Ready, boy?\"  asked Kiba, earning a happy and eager bark from the pup as they plopped down towards the edge, and slid right down, landing softly into the sandy part at the end, laughing all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked and said, \"Pretty sweet, isn't it.\"  Kiba, still beaming, nodded happily at the anthro and said, \"Wow, I ain't EVER been on a slide that long before...but I'll be damned if that ain't a blast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Naruto turned to Kurama and asked, \"Wanna give it a go?\"  Nodding eagerly, the kit immediately trotted over towards the ladder, climbing higher and higher...and higher and higher.  Looking down for a moment, the kit realized that, this slide really was a lot higher up than it looked, almost immediately his smile lowered a bit, almost looking a bit nervous as his climbing began to slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, upon reaching the top, he nervously stepped forward and looked down at the slide, and immediately, the sheer distance caused his four legs to quake as he inched away from the slide.  Seeing this, Naruto glanced up a bit curiously.  \"Hey, Kurama!  You okay?\" the boy asked from afar.  The kit smiled nervously and nodded, but his shaking was quite apparent.  Seeing this, Hunter frowned.  \"...The kid doesn't have a thing with heights, does he...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer his question, a soft kind of whimpering could be heard faintly from above.  Akamaru tilted his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yup...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I got this,\" Naruto told the others and proceeded to climb up the ladder as well.  Looking down, Naruto's eyes widened a bit.  \"Wow, this thing really IS high up,\" he said, but nonetheless smirked and reached the top, seeing a shivering Kurama trying to inch further away from the slide.  Naruto smirked a bit then cleared his throat, startling the kit as he immediately turned around and smiled somewhat sheepishly at Naruto.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  H-hi, Naruto!  I-I was just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a thing with heights, don'tcha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened as he immediately shook his head.  \"W-what?!  N-no!  Heh, t-that would be silly!  O-only b-babies are scared uh...\" then the kit gulped nervously and nodded.  Chuckling, Naruto playfully patted the kits nervous back and said, \"You don't have to pretend.  Everyone's scared'uh SOMETHING.  You wanna know something?\"  The kit nervously nodded ever so slightly as Naruto rubbed the back of his head and said, \"First time I tried to go on a slide...?  I almost wet myself...\"  Despite himself, Kurama couldn't help but snicker just slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep...\" Naruto said, knowing deep down that 'almost' didn't quite describe it, but still, he shook it off and added, \"That's just how things are, y'know?  Sometimes, things seem big and scary and you just wanna run as fast as you can.  Then you take 'em on anyway, and you see...things ain't so scary.  That's just how it is.  You never know unless you try, cause if ya do, ya might find what's scary, can actually be really fun and pleasant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tailed-Beast thought for a moment then glanced back at the slide, still fearful, but nodded firmly at Naruto's encouragement.  Immediately, he sat down, looked back at Naruto who smiled and gave the kit a thumbs up, and, after some internal pep talking, slid down.  The kits eyes widened as the speed and momentum picked up, filling his heart with a strange rush of adrenaline as the ground seemed nearer and nearer...however, once he'd reached the bottom, he'd leaned back just slightly, and rather than land into the sand patch, LAUNCHED in the air like a boulder from a catapult.  The eyes of Hunter, Kiba and Akamaru widened as they watched the little orange kit fly in the air, looking absolutely stunned...and landing straight into the grassy patch, disappearing completely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened with horror as he leaned down on the slide.  \"Oh crap!  Kurama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the boy slid down and rushed towards the grass as the others immediately joined him.  They found a rather dirtied and dazed looking Kurama laying in the grass, and immediately, Naruto helped the poor creature up.  \"A-are you okay?!\" the boy asked, expecting the worst, but at least thankful he appeared to be intact.  To his surprise however, a smile began to form over the kits muzzle as his mouth burst open with a loud...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya-HOOOOO!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others jerked back as the kit hopped merrily in the air, pumping his fists excitedly and joyously.  \"That was AWESOME!!\" Kurama exclaimed as he beamed happily and turned to Naruto and the others.  \"Didja guys see me?!  Everything was moving faster and faster and then WHOOSH!  I was up in the air...like a BIRD!\"  The others immediately sighed with relief before Naruto wiped some sweat from his brow and smiled back at the kit.  \"Heh, told'ja!\" he said, still incredibly relieved Kurama hadn't gotten hurt, or been terrified.  Then, the kit glanced around at how high the grass was and glanced back at the others, grinning almost mischievously.  \"Say, Kiba...remember that game you were playin' earlier...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba glanced curiously, then said, \"Oh!  You mean t-AHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish, Kurama leaped upward and pounced atop the young dog-nin, immediately rushing off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're it!\" the kit exclaimed merrily as he ran off.  Kiba hopped up to his feet and dusted himself off.  \"Oooh, that was dirty, you little...\" Naruto couldn't help but snicker at Kiba's pouting...what he didn't see was Kiba's impish grin as he swept Naruto onto his rump and raced off with Akamaru yipping and trotting happily besides him.  \"Now, YOU'RE it, bonehead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scowled as he saw Hunter snickering.  \"Ugh, falling for the same cheapshot twice in a row...?  Well, the hell with that!\"  Immediately, the boy hopped up to his feet and raced after the dog-nin and fox kit.  From afar, Hunter watched and smiled warmly as the youths continued playfully chasing and pouncing at one another like a bunch of cubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, surprisingly, his attention turned to the slide.  Shifting his eyes left and right, seeing the boys were far too distracted and no one else was in sight, Hunter smirked impishly to himself.  \"Ah, what the hell...\"  Nonchalantly, the anthro strolled towards the slide as the others continued playing, and upon reaching the top, he took in the sights for just a moment, put his glasses in his pocket, took a deep, refreshing breath, and slid down, doing his best not to cheer.  And; like Kurama, towards the bottom, he leaned back just enough to get launched into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...UNLIKE Kurama however, the poor anthro landed face first in the grass with a resounding THUD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost comically, Hunter laid sprawled, face first into the dirt, then slowly pulled his head out of the dirt, face conveniently covered in grass and dirt as he spat out a huge chunk of grass; like something out of an old cartoon, then sighed to himself.  \"Note to self...never slide again...<i>without a Goron mask</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, no one was around to laugh, though he's sure Rocket would have definitely gotten a kick outta that.  Nonetheless, he rose to his hind legs, dusted himself off, put his glasses back on...and started chuckling.  \"That WAS pretty epic...\" he muttered to himself, wincing just slightly as he rubbed his still tender muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time had passed as the boys continued playing without a care in the world...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hunter sat against a tree, arms folded behind his head and headphones secured in his ears. He bobbed his head slightly to the tunes blaring through the device, but his attention was focused on the others. He smiled as he saw Kiba tackle Naruto to the ground, only for Kurama to pounce on top of Kiba and send the three of them tumbling in a ball of arms, legs, and tails. <i>Damn,</i> Hunter thought as all three youths laughed joyously, <i>They've been at this for a while, and they've STILL got energy to spare!</i> He chuckled, adjusting his headphones a bit. <i>They're like three little bundles of energy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as that last thought left his head, he saw a small, white blur leap up and latch onto one of Kurama's tails. The kit yelped in surprise as Akamaru's sharp puppy teeth latched onto the appendage, but it quickly turned to happy giggles as he finally disentangled himself from the pile, rushing about and tails waving, even as Akamaru clung on. Hunter snorted a bit. <i>Make that four little bundles of energy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Kurama continued rushing about, Akamaru still latched onto his tail and the boys in hot pursuit. Kurama laughed uproariously, waving his tails about faster and faster, and Hunter could not help but raise his eyebrows. <i>Kurama had better be careful, or Akamaru's gonna go flying...</i> Indeed, Akamaru waved about more and more, evidently starting to lose his grip. Kiba seemed to notice, because he bellowed, \"Get ready to stick the landing, boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinked, giving an amused smirk. <i>'Stick the landing'?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had he thought that than Kurama gave a strong wave of his tails, finally breaking Akamaru's grip, The pup went flying through the air, straight toward Kiba...but the dog-nin simply grinned, tensed his legs, and <i>leapt</i> into the air, holding his arms out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's eyes widened. <i>Oh wow, look at that height. Then again, regressed or not, they're still ninja...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a happy bark, Akamaru oriented himself in the air, making it so that he was soaring directly at Kiba. Beaming, Kiba grabbed the pup as he neared him and held him close to his chest, grunting as he hit the ground, only to roll upon impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter tilted his head. <i>Oh wow...that was pretty impressive...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, having felt Akamaru release his grip, skidded to a halt and turned his head to double check. However, this was exactly the sort of opportunity Naruto-having rushed ahead while Kiba tumbled with Akamaru- had been waiting for. As Kurama looked at his tails, Naruto closed the distance and pounced upon Kurama, eliciting a gleeful yelp of surprise from the kit as they both crashed to the ground. \"Gotcha!\" Naruto exclaimed triumphantly, arms pinning the little Nine-Tails to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled, squirming under Naruto's grip. \"Oh no! Help! Help!\" Both youths burst into joyful laughter at that. Then, without warning, Kurama maneuvered one of his tails upward, reaching toward Naruto's armpit. The boy's eyes widened as he felt the fuzzy tip brushing against the area. \"Oh, come on, Kurama, that's loHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" The boy dissolved into helpless laughter as Kurama swished his tails about faster and faster, the blonde's arms shaking faster and faster...that is, until Naruto lost his balance and dropped right on top of the young Nine-Tails. The creature gave a small \"oof!\", but as Naruto composed himself, he seemed none the worse for wear. In fact, as Naruto plante=d his arms on the grassy ground to right himself, he looked up at the boy. In turn, Naruto stared down at the young Tailed Beast. This went on for a couple seconds...before massive grins split their faces and they one again burst into uproarious laughter, Naruto allowing himself to collapse back down atop his fuzzy buddy. Still shaking with mirth, they wrapped their arms around each others' torsos and rolled about a bit, giggling and generally looking as though they were having the time of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled warmly. <i>Aww, lookit them; can't believe how tight they've become...</i> The anthro's smile deepened as he thought about their interactions over the past few days: Naruto had been incredibly supportive of Kurama, and had been more than willing to explain things to him in the friendliest way possible. Not only that, but he had been the first to defend the kit when Rocket had yelled at him. And the fact that they had started throwing their arms over each others' shoulders a lot, well... <i>Looks like Naruto's got himself a little brother...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two rolled to a stop, panting and giggling in equal measure. Disentangling themselves from one other, the shakily got to their feet (and paws,) Naruto helping Kurama up. Panting, they looked at each other, smiling warmly. Kurama, in particular, looked back at Naruto with something undeniably like admiration<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded, smiling and leaning back against the tree. {i{And it looks like Kurama's found himself a big brother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two spent some more time standing and catching their breath, before, finally, Kurama eased up. Getting a little closer to Naruto, he said something to him, but since they weren't shouting, Hunter couldn't tell what they were saying at this distance. Naruto, also speaking normally, replied, to which Kurama smiled, nodded...and pointed right at Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro tilted his head in confusion. <i>Are they talking about...me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at Hunter, then back at Kurama, giving the kit a huge grin and a thumbs-up. Giving a cheer, Kurama thanked Naruto, turned around, and began running toward Hunter. \"Mister Hunter! Mister Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of himself, Hunter chuckled at the kit's enthusiasm. \"Yeah, kiddo?\" he asked as Kurama skidded to a stop before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama spent no time getting to the point. \"Do ya wanna come play with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter jolted in surprise, his headphones tumbling out of his ears. \"Y-you want me to play with you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama bobbed his head. \"Yuh-huh! I mean, you helped get me outta that scary place, treated me to one of the yummiest things I've ever eaten, taken us to this fun place...\" The kit looked up at him, beaming. \"I gotta thank you somehow, don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChest hitching a bit at the eager expression on the kit's face, Hunter's face reddened. \"W-well,\" he began, somewhat flustered, \"I-I'm flattered, I really am, b-but I don't know i-if I'll be a good playmate, and, well, wolves play kinda rough, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Mr. Hunter!\" Kurama urged, grabbing his paw and tugging at it. \"Please? It'll be really, really fun!\" The kit stared straight up at the wolf, eyes wide and pleading, his smile toothy and hopeful. Hunter could only stare back, jaw slack and eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh geez...how can something be THIS cute and not be deliberate?! If the kid ever thinks to use his cuteness to 'persuade' people, there are gonna be a lot of people with mush instead of hearts...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright,\" Hunter finally conceded. \"Suppose it can't hurt...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama beamed widely at him, wrapping his forelegs around his middle in a joyful hug, \"Thankyouthankyouthankyou!\" the kit exclaimed. Releasing the shell-shocked wolf's torso, he turned around and rushed back to the others. \"Hey, Naruto, Kiba, Akamaru! He said yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stared after the young Tailed Beast, eyes still a bit dull as he pocketed his MP3. <i>W-well...guess I better get in there...</i> He slowly got to his hind paws and walked out into the field....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hunter approached the small field, towards little Naruto and Kurama, once again removing his eyeglasses and tucking them away safely.  However, the closer he got, the more something seemed off.  Both boys were unable to retain what appeared to be a rather impish look on their faces.  The anthro was about to open his mouth to speak, when another dreaded thought entered his mind.  \"Wait a second...\" the wolf began, \"...where is Kib-AAAAAHHHH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Kiba leaped from the pushes and pounced atop the wolf, causing him to tumble backwards into the grass.  In no time at all, however, Hunter gained the upper hand, pinning a squirming and laughing Kiba down with with hand paws and grinning equally mischievously as he did.  \"Sooooo, like surprisin' people, do ya?  Well, I daresay, I'm quite...'tickled' by your surprise attack, Kiba...\"  Hearing that, Kiba's eyes immediately widened.  \"Uh-oh...\" the dog-nin muttered.  Resisting even more to no avail, Kiba was unable to prevent the anthro from pulling up his shirt enough to expose his bare stomach...and immediately begin ticklishly fluttering his digits against the boys exposed tummy, making him burst into a hysterical fit as he squirmed helplessly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-noo faAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  C-come ohohohahahahahaHAHAHAA!!!!!!!\" Kiba rambled incoherently, making Hunter's grin deepen as the tickling intensified.  Watching, Kurama snickered then turned to his blonde friend and asked, \"Shouldn't we help him?\"  But surprisingly, an impish grin grew over Naruto's face as he nodded innocently and said, \"In a bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Akamaru wasted no time intervening as he hopped atop Hunter's head and forced him off as he stumbled just a bit, allowing Kiba to recompose himself and pull his shirt back down.  Grinning, Naruto nodded and said, \"NOW!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru immediately hopped off Hunter's head, leaving him befuddled and bewildered for a second or two, leaving him open enough for a two pronged pounce, courtesy of Naruto and Kurama.  As he fell back down, he quickly managed to wrap his larger arms around Naruto and Kurama as the trio rolled about, all laughing merrily as they did.  However, Hunter had forgotten Kurama's nine advantages, all of which immediately started brushing and fluttering against his armpit, making him laugh; albeit more contained due to being (currently) older than the rest, but enough to loosen his grip on the two as Kurama moved in on the offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, kiddo,\" Hunter began, grinning mischievously as he did, \"but I'm not THAT ticklish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama yelped suddenly as Hunter grasped the little fox kit and pinned him down as well.  \"...Are you?\"  In no time all, the wolf began tickling beneath the kit's tummy similarly to how he had done with Kiba, and like Kiba, Kurama was unable to contain a hysterical burst of giggles as hind and front paws squirmed around merrily.  UNLIKE Kiba however, Hunter hadn't taken into consideration just how positively adorable the innocent little creature looked, flailing around with a big grin on his face and his eyes clenched shut, and the merry laughter emitting from him.  It was all too much for Hunter to disregard, even in the head of roughhousing.  For just a moment, he stopped and gaped at the little creature, feeling his heart practically melting at the seams.  Catching that, Naruto grinned confidently and charged.  \"Don't worry, buddy, I got your back!  Or should I say...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH!\" yelped Hunter as he felt Naruto latch onto his back firmly and shout, \"...I got YOUR back!\"  Laughing, Hunter got up, only to fall right back down as Kurama pounced back against the wolf, causing him to fall to his side, leaving Naruto unscathed as they rolled about.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally rising back to his feet, Kiba saw the scene and turned to Akamaru.  \"Pffft, as if they're gonna have a dog pile without US...?\"  The pup barked happily in agreement and in unison, the two leaped upward and jumped into the pile.  There was an immense amount of rolling and struggling, but finally, Hunter maneuvered himself and managed to stand up with all four still firmly latched onto his body comically, even as he pumped his fists upward in victory...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha-HAaaaaawwww no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...A rather short lived victory as the anthro tilted backwards like a falling statue and caused all five to tumble about in a massive pile.  Their roughhousing, pouncing, and occasional weaponized tickling had continued for quite some time until they all eventually rolled back into the tree Hunter had previously been lying under.  Upon landing, all five detached from the pile and landed besides each other on their backs, all breathing heavily and eventually, laughing merrily; if exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...man...\" gasped Hunter, still catching his breath as he grinned down at his four younger companions and grinned toothily, \"You kids don't mess around, do ya...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaming, Kiba shook his head.  \"Nope!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru panted heavily, tail wagging merrily as he did, then climbed atop Kiba's rising and falling chest, licking the boys face and yipped happlily  <i>That's what the 'big bad wolf' gets when he takes on a team like us!</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed and playfully ruffled the pup's little fuzzy head.  \"You said it, boy!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill catching their breaths and laying besides each other, Naruto and Kurama turned to each other and laughed.  \"That was awesome!\" exclaimed Kurama gleefully as he turned to Naruto and happily said, \"We make a pretty good team, don't we?\"  the kit asked.  Naruto smiled warmly and held his fist towards the kit, who saw and; smiling back at the boy, once again pounded it playfully with his fist.  \"Damn right, we do!\" the boy said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the two, once again, the wolf smiled warmly at the sight, then rested a hand against his stomach, feeling it had once again reached its flattened state.  \"Whew, guess we've been playing around longer than I thought!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama tilted his head curiously, then pressed a paw against his own belly, giggling to himself.  \"Wow!  I can't believe our tummies are already back to normal!\"  Kiba just smirked and said, \"Well, it ain't too surprisin', those birds were great, but we didn't fill up on 'em the way we usually do.\"  Naruto grinned impishly and nodded in agreement, \"Oh yeah...just wait til dessert kicks in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru turned to Hunter curiously.  <i>Think your grumpy pal's about done getting things prepped up?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned and nodded as he placed his glasses back on.  \"Could be.  You boys ready to head back?\"  They all turned to each other, grinning, then back at Hunter, nodding in unison as Hunter smirked then rose to his hind paws, along with Kiba, who once again, picked up his puppy pal and placed him atop his head, earning a happy bark from Akamaru as they began heading towards the inn, figuring Naruto and Kurama would follow shortly after.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quickly hopped to his feet, then reached down to help Kurama, but noticed a warm look on the kits' face as Kurama stared at something in the distance.  \"Everything okay, Kurama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit just nodded then pointed back at the object in the distance.  Naruto turned, then immediately smirked, seeing it to be that massive slide from earlier.  \"Liked it, huh?\"  Kurama bobbed his head then, turned to the boy and smiled almost gratefully at him.  \"I wouldn't have liked it if you hadn't helped me see how things don't have to be so scary.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just smirked then rubbed the back of his head.  \"Ah, it's no biggie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just with the slide,\" Kurama said, earning a curious glance from Naruto.  \"When Mister Rocket got mad at me, you stood up for me.  You helped me understand things better.  When I felt like my tummy was gonna burst and made me feel weak, you had confidence in me, told me I could keep goin'.  And when I was stuck in that scary place...you helped me feel like...like I wasn't alone anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto recoiled a bit, not expecting such praise all at once from the young Tailed-Beast, but nonetheless, smiled a bit nonchalantly and said, \"Well, I can't take ALL the credit, I mean, the guys helped a lot too!\"  Kurama nodded, well aware. Nevertheless, his smile softened a bit as he glanced more solemnly at the boy and added, \"I...I know, eventually, I hafta go back to that scary place...but for everything you've done for me...I just...I wanna say, thanks.  It might'uh only been a lil while, but, y-you're the bestest friend anyone could have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all so overwhelming, yet, so sincere.  Naruto didn't know how to respond.  But then, an idea occurred.  \"Whadduya say we go down that slide one more time before we eat?\"  The kit tilted his head curiously.  \"We?\"  Then, almost hopefully, he added, \"You mean together?  Ya mean it?\"  Naruto smiled warmly and said, \"Friends stick together, don't they?\"  The kit immediately beamed as Naruto smiled and helped him up to his paws.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading the way, he and Kurama climbed up to the top once more.  The height was still overwhelming for the kit, but he wasn't afraid this time.  Instead, he smiled confidently as he sat by the edge of the slide, as Naruto sat directly behind him and patted him on the shoulder.  \"Ready?\" the boy asked, earning a confident nod from Kurama as he leaned back into the boy for support and exclaimed, \"Ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the boy and kit pumped their fists in the air and slid down the ever high slide, both cheering merrily as they slid all the way down at delightfully rapid speeds, and managing to land safely into the sand patch this time with a soft THUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Naruto and Kurama wrapped their arms around each others respective shoulders in a brotherly manner as they laughed gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to them, Hunter and the others were watching from afar, and all smiling warmly at the sight, even Kiba.  \"Dummy or not...Naruto knows what the hell he's doing, when it comes to being a true friend...\" remarked Kiba, earning nods from the pup and wolf alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, the boy and kit rejoined the others and headed back to the inn...</span></div></div>",

Never woulda guessed...\" to emphasize this, he poked Kurama's belly, causing a few giggles to come forth from the kit. He got back on all fours and resumed walking alongside his blonde friend. \"'Course, its nothin' to be embarrassed about...\" he winced as his own tummy growled, and he rubbed it through his sleeveless hoodie and t-shirt. \"I'm feelin' kinda famished myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked and folded his arms behind his head, even as his belly (and Akamaru's) growled audibly. \"Heh, same here.\" He licked his lips. \"Can't wait to taste some of those pies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I can't wait to dip into some cookies and muffins,\" Hunter added, putting his hands in his pockets. Suddenly, his nostrils expanded, and he grinned. \"And we probably won't have to wait long, either; take a whiff, fellas!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, the youths snifed the air...and grins subsequently bloomed across their faces (and muzzles).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oh wow!\" Kurama exclaimed, once again coming to a stop. \"That...that smells...\" He tilted his nose high in the air, taking deep whiffs. \"I just wanna <i>eat</i> them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Naruto sniffed the air as well. \"Oh man, you're not kidding!\" He licked his lips. \"Don't think I've ever smelled smells that awesome before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, having a heightened sense of smell, was too busy salivating to say anything, but a huge, dopey grin was plastered across his features. Akamaru wasn't too much further behind. <i>Oh man...I can smell the donuts...they...they smell great!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled a bit, even as he took in a few of the delectable scents. There were all sorts of scents in there: thick smells, sweet smells, warm smells...<i>Can't wait to see what Rocket's got in store...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost on cue, Naruto turned to the others. \"Well, I dunno about you guys,\" he began, grinning impishly, \"but I don't wanna wait around just smellin'...\" Curious, Kurama turned to him to ask what he was thinking....but he'd already taken off for the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Heh; idiot actually has a good idea for once...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that statement, Kiba took off after the blonde, Akamaru holding onto his head for dear life (and enjoying every second of it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widened, Kurama nonetheless grinned. \"Hey, wait up, you guys!\" he called, taking off after them on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter watched the boys rush off, a smile on his muzzle. <i>Heh, eager little fellas, aren't they?</i> He quickened his pace. <i>Can't blame 'em, though; if Rocket's baking is HALF as good as his cooking, we're in for a real treat....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, the boys reached the inn first. Kurama, leading the pack, skidded to a stop in front of the door, the others coming up behind him (and Hunter following at a brisk pace not too far behind.) Eagerly, he reached a paw/hand up to open the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...only for it to swing open and a massive, wooden foot to almost come down on top of the boys. Yelping, they scooted back as Groot stepped out, looking about and smiling...only for him to look down and see the boys pressed up against one another. It didn't take long for him to put two and two together. \"....I am Groot,\" the tree-creature intoned, his tone apologetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Kurama beamed up at Groot. \"Aww, it's OK, Mister Groot; I know we're kinda small.\" The tree man said nothing, but simply nodded and smiled warmly at the three. Naruto, for his part, glanced at Kurama, his expression befuddled. \"You really get all of that from 'I am Groot'?\" the blonde asked, scratching the back of his head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama looked back at him, equally befuddled. \"He didn't say 'I am Groot'. He said, 'My apologies, little ones; I didn't see you there.' \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba raised a skeptical eyebrow. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama noddded. \"Yuh-huh! Mister Groot actually talks like that a lot. Like, when we first met, he said, 'Salutations, little one. I am called Groot; what might your name be?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gaped at Kurama, then at the simple-seeming tree-man. Maybe there was more to him then he'd thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Hunter came up behind them, smiling when he saw Groot. \"Hey, big guy,\" he waved. \"Rocket almost finished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot nodded. \"I am...Groot,\" he affirmed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He frowned as his ears twitched. That music sounded awfully familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvercome with curiosity, Hunter shouldered past Groot, muttering an apology as the young ones followed behind him. Groot, for his part, actually looked a little worried. \"I-I am Groot,\" he protested, raising a hand, but it was too late; the others were already headed for the kitchen. His shoulders slumped. \"I am Groot...\"  Shaking his head, he followed after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group reached the kitchen, the music grew louder, and Hunter could have sworn he could hear a couple lyrics:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...ome and...ove....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears shot straight up as realization dawned on him. <i>No way. Is he....</i> Suddenly, he snorted. The boys loked up at him in concern, but before they could ask, the door swung open, allowing Rocket to come out...dancing, his eyes clenched shut. As he did, he sang along to the music that was now clearly emanating from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Come and get your love...Come and get your lo-ove...</i>\" the raccoon sang as he did a little twirl, bobbing his head to the music. The youths gaped at the sight of the surly critter merrily dancing and singing (quite well, actually) along to the tunes emanating from the kitchen. Hunter? Well, Hunter's paw was clamped over his muzzle, evidently doing his damnedest not to bust a gut. Groot, meanwhile, came to a stop behind Hunter, throwing a worried look at the anthro. Rocket, somehow, remained oblivious to all of this.<br>\r\n\"<i>Y-eah, Y-eah,</i>\" he continued, doing another twirl and finaly opening his eyes. \"Come and...get your....ah, crap...\" he muttered, as he slowly looked up to see the others gaping at him. His eyes widened as they flittled to Hunter, then the kids, then back again. There was a noticeable silence in the air. Then, Rocket lifted a digit, pointed it at them, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saw nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Kurama tilted his head. \"B-but, Mister Rocket....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. Saw. No-thing,\" the creature repeated firmly. Kurama, still befuddled, opened his muzzle to protest, but before he could...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BAHAHAHAHAHA!\" Hunter exploded, bending over and clutching his middle. \"Th-this is too freaking priceless!\" He opened an eye and looked at the raccoon. \"Heh...enjoying your--SNORT---yourself there, Rockehehehee...\" Whatever else he said was lost as he dissolved into a fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket gave him the stinkeye. \"Oh, shut up,\" he snapped, folding his arms irritably. \"It helps me create...\" <i>Quill, I hate you so freakin' much right now...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Hunter was still busy laughing, and Rocket was a little upset, Naruto cut in. \"So, uh...is everything ready yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Rocket seemed to perk up a bit. \"Funny you should ask, kid...\" Winking, he made for the door. \"Follow me....\" He pushed the door open and walked inside. Naruto, Kiba, and Kurama looked at each other, curious, before they followed him. Hunter, still fighting to restrain his snickers, followed them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-gotta say, Rocket,\" Hunter gasped, getting himself under control, \"Whatever ya made, it smells...really...good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trailed off as he came to a stop behind the boys, each gaping out at the kitchen with shocked, overawed expressions on their faces. His face mirrored theirs as they beheld what the room held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround each side of the kitchen, several tables were set up next to one another, forming lines that encircled the entire area. Upon these tables....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, upon these tables was the biggest collection of sweets any of them had ever seen, the tables creaking under their weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassive cakes and pies, bigger and more numerous than any of them had ever seen, were stacked upon one another, massive towers of cookies and donuts beside them. Elsewhere, there were literally <i>mounds</i> of brownies, muffins, and cupcakes piled on top of one another, filling the room with a truly amazing aroma. In addition, there were gallons of some thick liquid that, judging by the empty ice cream containers next to them, were some kind of ice-cream based dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them said anything for a moment. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...\" Kurama whispered, eyes wide as saucers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...it's <b>beautiful</b>...</i> Akamaru murmured, tail wagging slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket, for his part, just smirked at the sight of them in their trance. \"Eh? Not too shabby, if I do say so myself...\" The others could only nod numbly in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that was all he was going to get out of them, Rocket continued. \"So, ya jackasses wanna bring these beauties out to the cafeteria, or do ya just wanna dig in right here, right now?\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon hearing his inquiry, Kurama turned to the others, fiddling his paws together a bit nervously and turned back to Rocket and said, \"W-well, you went through the trouble of setting them all up so nice and neat here.  I don't wanna mess that up, how about you guys?\"  Naruto and the others turned to each other and smirked as Naruto raised his shoulders innocently and replied, \"Nah, me neither.  Plus, carrying <i>this</i> much all the way over to the cafeteria?  Hehe, noooo thanks.\"  The kit giggled at that then glanced back at Rocket, smiling as he added, \"Besides, this way, once we finish up, it'll be easier to put dishes away so Ms. Anju won't have to carry them all the way from the cafeteria!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Rocket couldn't help but smirk just a bit at that.  \"Heh, awful considerate'uh ya, squirt.\"  Groot nodded approvingly and added, \"I am <i>Groot.</i>\"  To that, Kurama just rubbed the back of his fuzzy head bashfully and added, \"Aww, now you're just being too nice, Mister Groot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba leaned in towards the others and whispered, \"Didn't realize there was a nicer way to say, 'I am Groot,' live'n learn, huh?\"  The others snickered at that as Hunter rubbed his paws together and said, \"Well, I dunno about you guys, but I; for one, believe that this bounty isn't gonna eat itself.  So, let's get some chairs, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and the others headed into the cafeteria and grabbed four chairs, (seeing as how Akamaru was just gonna be on the table anyway) and set them down into the kitchen, pulling one of the empty side tables in the center for them to sit, completely surrounded by the bounty of desserts the raccoon had baked for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in no time at all, Hunter had grabbed a plate and set upon it a large pile of cookies and muffins, its' fresh baked aroma still treating the anthro's nose with an overwhelmingly delicious smell of the many flavors he was about to engulf.  Likewise, Naruto had set down an entire chocolate cake, smothered with milk chocolate frosting, all layered evenly and perfectly.  Naruto's mouth watered as he saw the treat, but his eager expression became one of confusion for a moment when he glanced at the top.  Atop this beautiful chocolate cake was a picture drawn with frosting of Rocket and Groot...and several money bags behind him.  The blonde raised an eyebrow and turned to the raccoon who immediately took notice and smirked nonchalantly as he muttered simply, \"True story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Naruto couldn't help but chuckle at the surprisingly well drawn caricature, mouth still watering with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with the others, Kiba too, had grabbed an entire cherry pie, still warm and steaming as he set its' pan down before him and grabbed a plate of several donuts and placed it down besides him for his little canine pal who yipped merrily at the sight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, on the other hand, had a slightly befuddled look to his face, but eager all the same as he examined the creamy looking liquid in the many pitchers waiting for him.  Catching this, Rocket approached the kit and asked, \"Somethin' wrong, kid?\"  The young kyuubi shook his head and added, \"Oh, n-no, nothing at all, Mister Rocket!  But, errrm,\" the kit's expression became a bit sheepish as he added, \"...I d-dunno what this is.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket immediately raised an eyebrow and said, \"Y'er jokin'...ya never had a milkshake before?\"  The kit tilted his head curiously at that and added, \"W-what's a milkshake?\"  To that, Rocket gaped, but after an insisting glance from Groot, he regained composure and explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, squirt...see, a milkshake is ice cream in drink form.  Not just MELTED ice cream like some uninformed jackasses might tell ya, but Ice Cream mixed with milk, vanilla extract, some sugar, and all blended into a creamy ice cream drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama listened attentively, but was completely lost and befuddled, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ice cream I can d-drink...?\" he asked, bewildered.  Rocket nodded and held his paws towards the creamy beverages set for him and added, \"And I set 'em up in all kindsa different flavors, so ya don't get bored...orrrr in case ya wanna share with y'er friends since, well, ya seem like the sharin' type...y'know, not that sharin' ever made a crap'uh sense...buuuuut hey, to each their own, right?  Tell ya what, grab a pitcher'n give it a sip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the kit trotted over to the table with the shakes and grabbed a basic vanilla shake.  It felt nice and cool just like ice cream, that much was certain.  However, he was about to take a sip when his nose accidentally dipped into something white and fluffy on top of the beverage.  Glancing at it curiously, Rocket took the hint and added, \"That's whipped cream.  I topped off all the shakes with 'em, and occasionally, sprinkled some chocolate flakes or cherries on top cause I'll be damned if I ain't gonna kill it with presentation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the kit licked the fluffy cream-like substance from his nose and muzzle and smiled at the taste, before taking a cautious sip of the beverage at hand.  The others watched curiously to see how the kit would react while Rocket watched with an all-too-confident grin on his face.  Sure enough, the kit pulled the pitcher from his muzzle, smacking his chops slightly as Naruto leaned in and asked, \"So?  How's it taste, Kurama?\"  To this, the fox turned to the others and was about to reply, but instead, simply went silent, eyes wide with astonishment.  Hunter just smirked and said, \"<i>That</i> good, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...this...so...so very...I...I can't even...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket just smirked at the young Tailed-Beasts inability to properly express the delicious creaminess that was the Rocket-Brand-milkshake and raised his shoulders.  \"Well, if that ain't a positive review, I dunno what is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit; still overwhelmed, simply carried the pitcher over to the table and sat down besides his friends, eyes still wide as saucers, much to the amusement of the three other youths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, boys?  Wolfy?  S'pose I don't gotta really say it since I made 'em'n know how perfect they are, buuuuut, hope y'all enjoy!\" Rocket declared as the wooden besides him raised a wooden finger and added, \"<i>I am Groot</i>,\" he said, as though reminding, causing the raccoon to snap his digits.  \"Riiiiiight!  Yeah, since you guys apparently liked Red's special homemade soda'er whatever, she left a few more pitchers for you guys too, in case ya want some.  Me?  I'll stick with the milk, thank ya very much...aaaaand on THAT note...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon had slyly turned on one foot and did a complete 180 degree spin, as he headed towards the door, but just then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!  M-Mister Rocket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the raccoon stopped, exhaled a small, mildly disgruntled sigh and turned right back around.  \"Yeah, kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I just wanna say...thank you so much.  This all looks so delicious'n...it was really nice of you to take the time to bake all this for us.\"  Rocket's expression softened slightly, a bit taken back at the genuine gratitude, moreso when Naruto nodded and said, \"Yeah, we really appreciate you actually makin' all this for us.\"  Kiba smirked and said, \"Eh, I'd 'uh been happy with just the pies, but SOME people seem to think cake is better...still, thanks, man!\"  Akamaru barked his gratitude as per usual and Hunter just grinned back at the raccoon and said, \"Ya heard the kids, this was damn decent'uh you, pal.  Thanks for showing these kids part'uh what makes this place and the people in it so great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot smiled warmly at them and nodded back as he turned back to Rocket who was looking away, clearing his throat, a bit befuddled himself.  \"Errr, y-yeah, hey, no biggie, right?  Just...uh...s-showin' off how killer my desserts are, heh...y-yeah...w-well, enjoy!  And uh...yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stammered, Groot leaned down and whispered, \"I am Groot?\"  Rocket, snapping out of his bewildered state, shook his head at the creature.  \"Why?  I know my bakin's good, I don't gotta see 'em enjoy it...n-no matter how genuine'n happy my stuff makes 'em...besides, they're gonna be swellin' up like water balloons and I AIN'T gonna be 'round for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am Grooooot...\"</i> the tree-man said, almost insistingly...</span></div></div>",

It's just, well..\" he laughed a bit, rubbing the back of his head. \"...Rocket kinda gets a little skeeved out when people stuff themselves like we did with the sundae?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blinked, tilting his head in confusion. \"Skeeved out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Naruto patted Kurama on the back. \"It means creeped out, basically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit's eyes lit up in understanding. \"Oh, I get it!\" Then, his muzzle screwed up in confusion. \"But...why does it creep Mister Rocket out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged. \"Eh, I dunno; guess that sort of thing just isn't for everyone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama nodded, but he still seemed a bit confused. But as he looked over at Rocket and Groot, still going back and forth, a smile slowly came to his muzzle as an idea occurred to him. \"M-Mister Rocket?\" the kit spoke up, catching Rocket's attention mid-rant. Spinning around on his feet, Rocket folded his arms. \"Yeah, kid, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama scratched the back of his head. \"Erm, sorry to ask this, but...how come you get creeped out when people eat a lot and get big tummies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket's eyes flew wide open. \"W-well, kid, see, the thing is...\" The raccoon stammered a bit, trying to find the right words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisinterpreting this as not knowing what to say, Kurama smiled. \"It's really not that bad, Mister Rocket. I mean, heck, just yesterday, me n' the others ate a HUGE sundae! Our tummies got as big as boulders, Akamaru looked like a beach ball, Naruto busted all the buttons on his shirt, their underwear was showing, and my belly button even...are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was said as he'd noticed that Rocket had turned a slight shade of green, and had swallowed rather queasily. Naruto, Kiba, Akamaru, Kurama, and Groot looked at him with some concern. Hunter, on the other, was doing his best not to give into a fit of snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mister Rocket?\" the kit repeated. \"A-are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few deep breaths, Rocket shook his head a bit. \"Y-yeah, I'm fine, kid,\" he muttered. \"Just threw up in my mouth a little...\" He burped rather queasily, and Groot put a soothing hand on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grimaced. \"Ewww....\" he muttered, sticking his tongue out. Then, a bit more concerned, he asked, \"you want me to get you some water so you can wash the icky taste out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon started, both at the unexpected offer and just how sincere it sounded. In spite of his nausea, he smiled. \"Th-thanks, kid, but I got a stronger constitution than that; I'll be fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Groot?\" the tree-man cut in, deeming it safe to remove his hand from his friend's back. Rocket's head whipped up toward him. \"What, are you kiddin'? If they're gonna get anything like THAT, I sure as hell ain't stickin' around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Ah, c'mon, don't ya wanna see if we like your stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rocket could protest, Naruto spoke up. \"Yeah, and its not like our guts are gonna start growing right away; can't ya stick around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket, flustered, scratched an ear. \"W-well, I guess I COULD...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Mister Rocket?\" Kurama piped up, smiling. \"Like Naruto said, our tummies aren't gonna start growing right away, and Im sure you wanna see how your stuff came out...\" He grinned widely at the raccoon as he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back a bit, Rocket shook his head. \"W-well, I, erm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot looked down at him, smiling. \"I am Groot....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket looked up at his tall friend, then at the others. He said nothing for a moment. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fine!\" he snapped. \"I'll stay here for a bit to watch you jackasses, just to make sure you can process how friggin' great my desserts are!\" He scowled. \"But lemme make something clear: the <i>millisecond</i> I see the <i>tiniest</i> bulge under your shirts, I'm hitting the Milk Bar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnperturbed, Hunter shrugged. \"Fair enough,\" he replied, smiling. Turning to the others, he asked, \"Well, boys,\" he began, picking up a blueberry muffin. \"Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of cheers answered him as Naruto and Kiba picked up their forks, Akamaru walked closer to his donuts, and Kurama grabbed a vanilla milkshake and an oatmeal cookie. \"I'll take that as a yes,\" Hunter chuckled as he opened his muzzle wide to take a bite....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rocket stood besides his wooden pal and simply observed the faces of his 'taste testers' as it were.  In unison, each one's face lit up, the more they chewed; even Hunter, as they all gulped down their tasty baked good, and leaned back slightly, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket held his paws out to his sides curiously.  \"And survey says...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sputtered for a moment, trying to process what he'd just taken a bite out of, utterly bewildered; his (currently) younger companions not much further off.  Finally, he said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...R-Rocket...that...that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Naruto quickly blurted out, \"Holy CRAP, that's good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded in agreement, utterly amazed by the flavor of his pie as he licked some cherry sauce residue from his lips.  \"You ain't kiddin', bonehead...I swear, this thing tasted perfect!  Just a burst of warm, sweet flavor...and the crust...!  It's so soft yet flaky!  A-and it absorbs so much cherry sauce that bit of crust has like...a mini burst of cherry goodness to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru simply stared wide eyed at his doughnut, tail wagging as he did.  <i>If this is what a REAL doughnut is supposed to taste like...then what the HELL have I been eating all this time...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kurama licked his chops of all crumbs and just beamed merrily at the taste.  \"A-and I thought the milkshake was yummy!  This cookie taste...taste...like MEGA yummy!  It's like, like, if yummy, could double its' yumminess...then double its' double yumminess!  THAT'S how yummy this tastes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Hunter...?  Well...the bewildered athro was simply gaping down at his muffin, as though staring into the eyes of divinity itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Rocket...this muffin...it's...CRIMINALLY moist...and the berries...I...I can't even...wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket smiled a confident, just slightly smug smile as he brushed his paw against his chest proudly and said, \"What'd ya expect from the master, kid?\"  Groot, for his part, just smiled and rolled his dark eyes.  \"<i>I am Groot...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that, Rocket glanced up at the walking tree and said, \"Whaaaaat?  C'mon, I'm the freakin' PERSONIFICATION of humble!\"  To his surprise, when he turned back, the others still had amazed expressions on each of their faces.  Then, his expression softened just slightly as he asked, \"You guys really like 'em <i>that</i> much...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd immediately, Kurama bobbed his head excitedly, tails swishing about happily as he said, \"Yuh-huh!  These are the most bestest, yummiest desserts I've ever tasted, Mister Rocket!  You hafta be the greatest chef in the world, er' something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Rocket's smirk also softened a bit warmly for a moment.  \"You...really think so...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another big bite of his chocolate cake, Naruto gulped down his mouthful and wiped his mouth of chocolate frosting.  \"I sure as hell think so!\"  Kiba joined the blonde and took another huge bite himself, smiling gleefully as he savored the surge of flavor emanating from the pie.  \"Yep!  Same here!\" Kiba said between chews.  Akamaru, simply barked in agreement and proceeded to chomp into his doughnut merrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at this point, if Rocket and the others didn't know any better, they'd swear Hunter was speaking a completely different language at this point.  But the general gist of his bewildered rambling; if Rocket could make anything else out, was that he seemed quite fond of the muffins Rocket had baked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, at that, Rocket cleared his throat and said, \"W-well...err, g-glad you mugs like 'em so much, heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Groot smiled and almost playfully yet gently nudged the raccoon and held his hand out to the table for emphasis.  \"I, am <i>Groot?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Rocket smirked a bit and said, \"Y-yeah, guess it's...KINDA nice, seein' first hand how much people like my work...like...seein' peoples faces light up...the s-smiles on all their faces...and-\" immediately, he sputtered and shook his head.  \"Uh!  I-I mean, y-yeah!  No surprise, heh...c-course they like my bakin'...a-as if there was any doubt, right?\"  Groot just smiled back at the raccoon and shook his head with amusement as he and Rocket watched the others immediately dig back into the desserts.  Rocket, occasionally having to force back an impending smile of pride and gratitude.</span></div></div>",

And, if their eager smiles and enthusiastic eating were any indication, the answer was: a hell of a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Heh; would ya lookit that,</i> he mused, doing his best to keep a smile forming on his face with mixed results. <i>Seem like they're enjoyin' themselves...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was taking huge bites of of his muffins, his tail wagging as he chewed, often taking a muffin or cookie in each paw and taking alternating bites of each until they were gone. He must have been pretty eager, too, since he would barely be down swallowing when he'd grab a couple more and start the whole thing over again, licking his chops of crumbs all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde kid-Naruto, or something-was still eagerly diving into his chocolate cake, forking mouthful after mouthful into his waiting mouth until his cheeks bulged with the dessert. At that point, he would grin, swallow, lick his lips (still leaving some chocolate frosting on them, Rocket noted with some amusement) and dive right back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette kid and his dog-Kiba and Akamaru, wasn't it?- were likewise engaged, the boy forking mouthful after mouthful of flaky crust and cherry filling into his waiting mouth, with the pup taking large bites of the doughnuts (none of which contained chocolate, of course), his tail wagging merrily. Like his blonde friend, Kiba stuffed his mouth to capacity before swallowing, licking his lips, and getting right back to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Kurama...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the little fuzzball seemed to REALLY be enjoying himself; whether it was cramming cookies into his mouth or picking up a milkshake and guzzling it down, he always did so with a joyful smile on his muzzle, eyes clenched shut, and giggle after giggle effusing from the young creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Heh,</i> Rocket thought, scratching one of his ears. <i>Guess the kid really DOES like my cookin' a lot....</i> In spite of himself, he smiled a bit as Kurama grabbed a pitcher of chocolate milkshake and proceeded to guzzle it, hind legs kicking merrily...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his eyes widened suddenly. <i>Whoa, what the hell?</i> Looking down at his chest, he frowned. <i>Coulda sworn my heart stopped for a second there...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, he looked up and back toward Kurama. This time, he noticed, the young fox was dipping a few chocolate-chip cookies into both the vanilla and chocolate milkshakes he'd grabbed and taking big bites out of each, squirming happily even as his muzzle gradually became ringed with ice-cream drink...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket winced a bit. <i>Oh wow; that's, uh...</i> He staggered slightly as-yes!-his heart stopped beating for a few seconds, only to resume its business as though nothing had happened. <i>The hell's wrong with me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kurama burped wetly. Blushing, he rubbed the back of his head. \"H-heh, 'scuse me...\" Then, without another word, he grabbed the pitcher of vanilla, which was halfway-depleted at this point, and leaned back in his chair, chugging as much of it down as he could. After a bit, he lowered it, his muzzle practically covered in milkshake, and giggled. \"Oh wow, this is so <i>yummy!</i>\" Then, he burped again, rubbing his tummy and licking his chops, kicking his legs happily all the while...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnngggghh....\" Rocket groaned under his breath, earning a concerned glance from Groot. <i>Damn it,</i> he thought, wincing as he felt his heartbeat slow dramatically. <i>Gotta...keep...heart...going...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end, he turned away from the others...and began pounding his chest, much to Groot's confusion. \"I am...Groot?\" The tree-man inquired. Rocket, still thumping on his chest, held up a digit as though to say \"wait a minute\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did not escape Kurama's notice; lowering his pitcher, he looked over at the raccoon. \"Mister Rocket?\" he asked, his tone concerned. \"Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over at Kurama, Rocket nodded, but did not stop pounding his chest. \"Really? You don't look alright...\" This caught Hunter, Naruto, and Kiba's notice, and they all looke over at the raccoon furiously thumping his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru tilted his head. <i>What's wrong with him?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shrugged. \"Hell if I know; maybe he grabbed somethin' from the tables and it got stuck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, however, upon clapping eyes upon Rocket, knew <i>exactly</i> what was going on, and his paw flew to his muzzle as he tried to stem the explosive tide of snickers that threatened to burst forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, oblivious to Hunter's amusement tilted his head. \"Mister Rocket, what's wrong?\" Looking down at his stomach, he felt it through his shirt; then, taking a paw, he lifted it up to reveal his still-flat orange-furred tummy. \"Our tummies haven't even started growing yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, kid,\" Rocket finally managed, his heart starting to get back into rhythm. \"I-it's not that; just, uh, got a little dizzy for a second there...\" Coughing, he stood back up, his heart finally having resumed its normal pace. \"I'm OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, blinking, nonetheless pulled his shirt back down. \"Well...if you say so...\" Then, without further ado, he turned back to his cookies and milkshakes, licked his chops, and resumed diving back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket breathed a sigh of relief. <i>Phew; glad that's over...</i> A snicker suddenly caught his ears, and he fixed his gaze on Hunter, who was doing his damnedest not to burst out laughing. \"The hell are you lookin' at, wolfy?\" the raccoon demanded, narrowing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly getting himself under control, Hunter managed a \"Nothing,\" then quickly turned back to his cookies and muffins. The boys and Akamaru, likewise, got back to their desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket shook his head. <i>Well, that was...somethin' else...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's like I'm eatin' 'em for the first damn time over here!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Rocket chuckled at the sight.  <i>Are these kids SERIOUSLY arguin' over which dessert tastes better...?  Ain't the answer obvious?  They all taste amazin' cause I'm amazin' and so is every-freakin'-thing I cook!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to the self-praise from the racoon, Hunter was about to open his mouth when Kurama beat him to the punch and said, \"Well, why don't we all share?\"  At that, everyone glanced at the little creature rubbed his front paws together bit to himself as he glanced back at Rocket with a smile, then back at his friends.  \"Mister Rocket made everything extra yummy, so no matter what we eat or drink, it'll taste yummy, right?  Plus, we have tons of each yummy dessert to go around!  So we won't be missing out either.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the others glanced amongst themselves as grins started forming across their faces and muzzles.  \"Heh, y'know somethin'?  That doesn't sound like a bad idea,\" remarked Kiba as Naruto nodded and added, \"Yeah, smart thinkin', Kurama!\"  Hunter; despite having the same notion, just smiled back at the young creature and remarked, \"Follow by example, right, kiddo?\"  At that, Kurama giggled and rubbed the back of his fuzzy orange head bashfully.  \"Aww, it's nothin',\" the kit remarked, as he proceeded to pass pitchers of shakes down to everyone at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Any shake that's not chocolate'll do...buuuuut are there any strawberry shakes, per chance...?</i> mused Akamaru eagerly, as Kurama giggled back and nodded.  \"Here ya go, Akamaru!\"  The pup barked his thanks as Naruto, Kiba and Hunter proceeded to pass along some of their own respective treats down to everyone else at the table, all with plenty more to go around.  Kurama then held a paw up, like a toddler in school and said, \"Oooh!  Oooh!  Mister Hunter?  Can we have some soda too?  Miss Anju said she made some for us, and I'd feel bad if I didn't have some.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Hunter just smirked and ruffled the kits head.  \"Heh, sure thing, lil guy,\" he remarked, as he got up, grabbed a couple of cups for himself and the others, and carried the pitchers Anju had left for them and set them on the table.  Kurama beamed up at him, then giggled a bit to himself as he turned to the others.  \"Plus, drinking milkshakes and soda sounds REALLY yummy!\"  The other youths snickered to themselves as they each took a respective bite of a new treat.  Naruto took a nice big bite of blueberry pie.  Kiba a fairly sizable chunk of vanilla cake.  Kurama bit into a nice warm muffin.  Akamaru slurped down some milkshake and Hunter wolfed down a donut in a single go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as all five gulped down their new treats; as one, all of their faces lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-holy crap!\" exclaimed Naruto as he licked his lips of blueberry syrup from the pies innards.  \"You weren't jokin', dog-breathe!  This is the best damn pie I've ever tasted!\"  Kiba smirked and added, \"Well, now that'cha mention it, bonehead...this cake ain't half bad either!\"  Akamaru, licking his chops, barked happily as he smacked his chops of strawberry shake residue, and Kurama being Kurama....beamed joyously at how positively delicious that delectable first bite of muffin was.  \"Mmm-mmm!  Why haven't I ever heard'uh these things before?  It's all so warm and soft and buttery and just...tastes soooooo yummy!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket couldn't help but chuckle a bit at all the praise, rubbing the back of his head as he looked away, (trying desperately not to make another scene by watching the kit express his joy) and said, \"Heh, what can I say...I aim tuh serve, boys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot glanced down at his fuzzy friend and just smirked.  \"<i>I am</i>, Grooooot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Rocket smirked and raised his shoulders.  \"Ey, tips're one thing, but, what can I say...?  Actually SEEIN' how much people like...how much people <i>appreciate</i> what I make 'em...?  Feels...kinda nice, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his chops some more, Kurama glanced back at the anthro wolf and tilted his head curiously as he saw the wolf thumping his chest, almost similarly to how Rocket was earlier.  \"Are you OK, Mister Hunter?  You're not feeling dizzy like Mister Rocket was, are you?\"  Hunter shook his head, and after one final thump against his chest, burped loudly, earning a few chuckles from the gang.  \"Guess you REALLY liked those donuts, huh,\" remarked Naruto, still snickering.  Chuckling a bit sheepishly, Hunter smirked and said, \"Heh, sorry, I probably shouldn't have gulped down an entire donut in one go, but damn, I couldn't help it!  These things really DO taste incredible!\"  Hunter then turned his attention to Rocket and gave him a thumbs up.  \"My complements to the chef!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket smiled back, somewhat warmly for a moment, then immediately shook it off with a more casual smirk.  \"Eh, you know where the tip jar is, Wolfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, all five proceeded to dig right back into their new treats, with Rocket glancing back periodically, undeniably touched by all the praise.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The five continued digging into their treats, eagerly gulping down their respective courses. They had each already demolished their second courses, and had moved onto a third, then fourth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, they were each on their fifth courses each; Hunter was tearing into a warm, crispy apple pie, and doing all he could not to moan in sheer delight at the warm, syrupy apples or the flaky crust, Naruto was scarfing down a towering stack of donuts, Kiba was cramming cookie after cookie into his waiting mouth, Akamaru was eating his way to the middle of a large pound cake with vanilla frosting, and Kurama was scarfing muffin after muffin, grinning even as crum began encrusting his muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Rocket had watched the five go at it, the thoughts of the impending size of their stomachs gradually slipping from his mind. <i>Damn...fifth paltes, and they're still not lettin' up!</i> the raccoon thought, scratching the back of his head a bit. <i>Guess they really DO like my bakin'...of course they do, I made it....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a giggle caught his ears, and he looked up to see the Keaton kid-Kurama, he corrected himself (Kurama? The hell kinda name was that?)- grinning widely, rubbing his stomach with one hand even as he bit into a particularly large chocolate-chip muffin, his legs kicking happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket sighed, unable to help the smile that came to his face. <i>Still, to see them enjoyin' it so much...I hate to say it, but it kinda gives me the warm 'n fuzzies..</i> Rocket blinked, surprised he had just thought that, but he never let the smile leave his face. Groot, knowing full well what his small friend was thinking about, simply smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kurama rubbed his stomach, though, his eyes widened. <i>Huh?</i> Blinking, he set his muffin down on the table, and examined his stomach more closely. His face split in a grin. \"Hey, Naruto, lookit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm?\" the blonde mumbled, gulping down the last of a jelly donut. Licking the sugar off his lips, he turned to his nine-tailed buddy. \"What is it, Kurama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering, Kurama beamed and pointed to his stomach. It had taken on a noticeable round shape, bulging out and pushing against his shirt noticeably (and pushing the flame symbol out a bit in the process.) The blonde's eyes widened. \"Wow, your gut's started growing...\" Something occurred to him, and he looked down at his own stomach. Sure enough, his was bulging as well, pressing against his sleeveless hoodie. He smirked. \"Heh, so's mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket's smile promptly fell from his face. <i>Aaaaaand fuzzy feeling's gone...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to the raccoon's disgust, Naruto looked across the table at his dog-nin pal. \"Oi, Kiba! Check out your stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting, Kiba scarfed down what was left of his oatmeal cookie. \"Stomach? The hell are you...\" his hand wandered down to his belly, and his eyes widened as he looked down and noticed that it, too, was rounded and bulging against his shirt. \"Heh, well, whaddaya know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoting Kiba's reaction, Hunter looked down and rubbed a paw against his own belly, which was bulging as well. <i>Wow, growing already? Then again, we ARE on our fifth dessert courses...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the hint, Akamaru glanced down at his own belly, noticing that it had taken on a rather concave appearance. However, to his surprise, he found he didn't mind at all. <i>If looking like I'm carrying puppies is the price for scarfing these desserts...</i> the pup licked his chops. <i>Well, I'll let myself become a bowling ball again if it means I get to eat more of these yummy treats!</i> And, to his own surprise, he meant every 'word'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled, and was about to open his mouth to say something, when he saw something out of the corner of his eye. Turning his head, he titled his head as he saw Rocket tossing off his chef's hat and stained apron, revealing himself to be wearing an open vest over a shirt much like Hunter was, except the shirt was sleeveless as well, in addition to a pair of trousers. \"Mister Rocket? Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket looked back at him. \"Hey, I said I'd stick around 'till those feed bags of yours started growin',\" the raccoon groused. \"And lo and behold...\" The creature turned a bit green, and Groot rubbed his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter couldn't help but smirk. <i>Heh; ya big baby...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut loud, the anthro said, \"So you're hittin' the Milk Bar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of himself, Rocket smirked, all while looking everywhere except their midsections. \"Yeah; probably gonna down so much milk I'mma forget my own name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Kurama turned to Naruto. \"How can milk make you forget your name?\" he asked the blonde. Equally confused, Naruto just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter caught this on the edge of his vision and chuckled. <i>I'll explain to 'em later,</i> he decided. Focusing his attention back on Rocket, he continued, \"Well, just don't make yourself sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivately touched by the wolf's concern, Rocket snorted and shrugged, attempting to brush it off. \"Eh, thanks for the concern, wolfy, but I've downed three Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters in a row and still managed ta' stand; I think I'll be fine.\" He jabbed a thumb at Groot. \"'Sides, I'll have Groot; I end up passing out, he can just carry me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroot smiled. \"I am Groot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon turned back toward the tree man. \"Oh, quit pretendin' ya mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he headed toward the door, Groot following close behind. Opening the door, he turned back toward the group one more time. \"Feel free 'ta stuff yer craws all ya want; plenty to go around.\" With that, he walked through the door, Groot ducking under to get through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the odd pair had departed, the group all exchanged glances. \"I gotta say,\" Hunter started, rubbing the back of his head, \"I'm surprised he stuck around that long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to continue when Kurama piped up, \"Um, Mister Hunter? How come he was sayin' the milk would make him forget his own name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and how come he said it'd make him pass out?\" Naruto piped up. \"I mean, yeah, I've had a ton of milk at once before, and I felt sick, but I didn't feel like fainting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled. \"Well, boys, the thing is, the milk they serve at the Milk Bar is...special.\" At the confused looks from the youths, he continued, \"See, even though they don't add alcohol or anything, the milk they serve has something done to it that makes ya a little tipsy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked. \"Wait...so he's gonna get himself drunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed. \"That he is, Kiba, that he is.\" He rubbed the back of his head. \"Personally, though, I don't blame him. I mean, it's the cool, refreshing taste of milk coupled with the pleasure of getting drunk without the bitter alcohol taste; kinda hard to walk away from that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, he blushed. <i>I should know...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing, he regained his composure. \"Well, then, boys? Shall we continue to partake of this lovely bounty of tooth-rotting sweets?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, all four of the young ones grinned and dove back into their treats. Smiling, Hunter did the same with his pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight out side the door, Rocket couldn't help but smirk as he heard them continue to dig into his desserts. <i>Heh, it's still disgustin' that they're gonna be swellin' up...</i> He burped a bit queasily at the thought, but composed himself. <i>...but hearing how much they like my stuff? Gotta say, it feels...nice...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmacking himself in the face to compose himself before his thoughts went all sappy, he motioned for Groot to follow him, and together, they made their way toward the Milk Bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious, the five continued digging into their desserts, enjoying every minute of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more time went on, and their stomachs slowly but surely continued to grow....</span></div></div>",

It had gotten to the point where both Naruto's hoodie and Kiba's shirt had been stretched so far that a silver of flesh had now been exposed at the very bottom of both their shirts.  Hunter fared about the same as well, with a small sliver of brown fur exposed.  And as Akamaru continued chomping away, his own white furred belly continued to balloon up from the size of a grapefruit to the size of a melon, with no signs of slowing down any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting a hand on his belly, Naruto smirked as he felt his stomach's flesh peaking from the bottom of his shirt, before glancing back up.  For just then, something else had clicked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" remarked Naruto, as he glanced back at the young tailed beast, \"heh, guess you really ARE enjoying yourself, eh, Kurama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even trying, young Kurama's tummy seemed to have bloated up even more than others, with more of his orange furred belly exposing itself than the others.  Not that it mattered even remotely.  The kit was so caught up with the sheer burst of warm, buttery flavor emanating from his muffins that he hadn't even caught wind of how much faster he was eating his meal than everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, until Kurama's eyes opened, and the smile dropped from his fuzzy face.  Catching this, Naruto frowned and rested an arm on his buddies shoulder.  \"Hey, everything cool, Kurama?\"  Glancing back at his blonde friend, Kurama smiled slightly and nodded assuredly as one hand drifted atop his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh, yeah, I'm OK.  But my tummy kinda feels weird...like, something's pushing into it,\" the young fox kit replied.  Almost immediately, Akamaru stopped mid bite and whined to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Heeeeeere we go...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama tilted his head curiously, but Kiba snickered and said, \"Hehe, check out your pants, fuzzy.\"  Only more befuddled, the little kyuubi nonetheless complied, then immediately felt what the dog nin boy was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhhh...w-what do I do...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Naruto leaned back for a moment and folded both arms behind his head.  \"Weeeeeell, you COULD just unbutton it so your gut has more room to breathe...\" and naturally, just one moment later, the boy's grin grew ever more impish as he leaned in and said, \"Orrrrrrr...you could fight through the tightness and blast that button right off!  Y'know, like yesterday, when my shirt buttons started snapping off one at a time?  Just like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes immediately lit up, and grinned a little impishly himself, recalling that moment from last nights 'sundae escapades.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching those buttons just snap off and fly around the room WAS incredibly entertaining to the young kit; despite getting nailed by one.  But then, he frowned, feeling how uncomfortable his pants were getting already.  Pant buttons are a lot tougher than shirt buttons.  For all he knew, popping his button off could take a lot longer, and odds are, the tighter and tighter his pants became, the more his tummy would likely start to hurt...and he and his friends were having so much fun, enjoying Rocket's baking immensely.  The absolute last thing Kurama would want to do is spoil everyone's fun by crying like a baby if his tummy started hurting too much, again, like he did yesterday...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, actually, Naruto...is it okay if I...j-just unbutton my pants...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at his orange furred friend curiously for a moment, Naruto immediately nodded, and replied.  \"W-well, yeah, heh, not like ya need my permission'er anything, but why wouldn't you wanna-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's just...my tummy might start hurtin' like yesterday'n I might start cryin' like a baby again, and-and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Naruto wrapped his arm around Kurama's shoulder and nudged him both playfully and assuredly.  \"Hey, hey, don't worry about it, pal.  Ya don't gotta explain yourself like that.  If you wanna do somethin', go for it, and if not, then ya don't gotta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But doesn't that make me a spoiled sport...or a chicken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked and said, \"Nah, we're in Termina, remember?  They're called Cuccoos here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Kurama snickered a bit, then Naruto smiled warmly and said, \"Nah, it doesn't make you either one.  And you damn sure ain't spoilin' no ones fun, as we saw with that gallery awesomness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled a bit as he rubbed the back of his head sheepishly.  \"Heehee...yeah, I still can't believe I got that carried away either...\"  He then glanced back at Naruto and smiled warmly right back.  \"Thanks, buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked happily at something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...My backside would just like to thank you for agreeing not to accidentally shoot a pants button into it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama snickered then turned to Hunter and added, \"'Sides, Mister Hunter was nice enough to let me wear these neat looking clothes.  I wouldn't wanna wreck 'em.\"  At that, Hunter just chuckled.  \"Ohhh, don'tchu worry 'bout that, kiddo...Midna definitely definitely doesn't, hehe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that, Hunter couldn't help but admire how considerate the young creature was to everyone.  To the point where it almost baffled the anthro how ANYONE could ever be so pure and innocent...especially considering where Kurama would eventually end up in his later years...but now wasn't the time for such thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, after some fumbling, Kurama fumbled around for a bit, squirming and wiggling a bit comically for a moment as he reached and reached for his button over his bloated belly, until eventually, the kit grabbed a hold of the button and undid it.  No sooner than he did that, did his tummy immediately expand outward, causing more of his shirt to ride up and expose more orange fur, as well as press the zipper teeth downward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh, much better!\" exclaimed Kurama with immense relief in his voice as he gave his belly a few hearty pats of relief, burping suddenly shortly after, causing him to giggle a bit, before tearing right into his muffins yet again.  Kiba glanced at the kits expanded stomach for a moment, then back at his, then Naruto's, then Hunter's, even Akamaru's.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap,\" Kiba muttered, \"fuzzball's really takin' us to school here, ain't he...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to everyone's surprise, the kit's tummy was rather notably larger than everyone else's.  At that, Naruto playfully punched Kurama's arm, much to his amusement.  \"Pffft, and you're worried 'bout bein' a spoiled sport...as if!\"  Kurama simply giggled and said, \"Heehee, I can't help it!  Mister Rocket's gotta be the bestest cook ever!\"  Hunter just smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Heh, that big softy would be turning to mush if he heard that...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Naruto's grin once again grew mischievous as he turned to the others and said, \"Welp...I dunno bout you guys, but I think it's time we upped our game...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru scoffed to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Was bound to happen sooner or later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than he said that, did Naruto, Kiba and even Hunter proceed to hasten their devouring of Rocket's baked goods.  Despite himself, Akamaru snickered and joined in on the fun, rapidly devouring his pound cake, yet savoring every ounce of flavor in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moments just flew by...along with the occasional crumbs splattering every which way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as more and more time had went on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before long, the group had demolished their fifth plates and had moved onto their sixth ones. This time, Hunter was scarfing down doughnut after doughnut, Naruto was cramming all manner of muffins into his mouth, Kiba was tearing into a rather large pile of cookies, Akamaru was eating his way to the center of a sizable blueberry pie, and Kurama was gleefully cramming mouthful after mouthful of chocolate cake into his maw, spattering his face and muzzle with frosting and crumbs. Every now and then, one of them would take a gulp of a milkshake pitcher that Kurama had been thoughtful enough to bring over to the table. Owing to the already-filled state of their bellies, their midsections had continued to grow as they'd finished their previous courses, and only continued to swell as they tore into their six plates. Hunter, Kiba, and Kurama's shirts continued to slide upward, exposing more of their tummies. In particular, the stylized flame spiral on Kurama's shirt was starting to distort and scrunch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, though, Naruto's sleeveless hoodie and, by extensions, the short-sleeved blue t-shirt underneath it, had not seemed to rise much higher than it currently was, even as his stomach inflated further and further. Noticing this and frowning, the boy had picked up his pace, savoring the flavors of the muffins even as he kicked into overdrive, eager to get his hoodie and shirt rising once more.<br>\r\nInfuriatingly, it refused to rise any further. However, as Naruto crammed baked good after baked good into his waiting mouth, his stomach continued pushing against his hoodie, sticking out more and more in front of him and putting more and more pressure on the garment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winced a bit as he felt his hoodie starting to constrict his tummy, but shook it off and pressed on; he had a lead now, and he sure as hell wasn't gonna lose it if he could help it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for some time; all parties involved continued stuffing their faces, slowly inflating their stomachs further (and, in Kurama's case, slowly pushing his fly down further and further). Naruto, in particular, ate at near-breakneck speed, causing more and more strain on the front of his hoodie, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pop</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened as he heard the noise, accompanied by a slight release of pressure around his belly. <i>Huh?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the muffin he had in his hand down for the moment, he felt around the area where he had felt the release in pressure, and looked down. Sure enough, a few of the teeth of his hoodie had pried themselves apart, exposing a tiny bit of the blue-shirted tummy underneath. <i>Huh, whaddaya know...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, gulping down a rather large mouthful of strawberry milkshake, glanced over at his friend, somewhat concerned. \"Naruto? Is everything OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked, turning toward the young kit. \"E-eh?\" At the concerned look on Kurama's face, Naruto laughed, rubbing the back of his head. \"Ah, yeah, I'm fine. It's just, well...\" he chuckled sheepishly, scratching his cheek. \"...your pants ain't the only thing that's giving up the ghost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama tilted his head. \"Huh? What're you...\" the kit faltered as Naruto, grinning, gestured to his belly, and the spot where a few of the teeth of his hoodie had pried themselves open. \"Ohhhhh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto giggled. \"Heh heh, now I know why my hoodie has hardly been going up.\" He smirked. \"But if I manage to bust this open...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled at the mental imagery. \"Hee hee, that sounds like it'd be awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked, placing a hand on Kurama's shoulder and gently rocking him a bit. \"Of course it does; I'm the one doing it.\" Kiba, still stuffing his face, rolled his eyes, but never stopped shoveling the tasty treats into his mouth. Ignoring the dog-nin, Narut turned back to his muffins, though he still looked at Kurama out the side of his vision. \"Keep a lookout, Kurama; you're about to see something awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObligingly, the kit watched with rapt attention, even as he resumed cramming forkfuls of cake into his mouth. Naruto was now practically cramming entire muffins into his mouth, his cheeks bulging until he chewed them enough to gulp them down. Wincing, he nonetheless kept his pace up, swelling his stomach more, and slowly but surely beginning to pry apart the teeth of his hoodie...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto was like a machine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffin after muffin, Naruto seemingly wolfed the whole thing down, stuffing them straight into his eager maw as he chomped away relentlessly.  Just chewing as quickly as he could, just enough to get them to go down before he'd move onto more.  Even as he winced visibly with each and every sharp gulp, he pressed on, trying to get his hoodie to bust open and liberate his stomach of this confounded pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the others continued wolfing down their own baked goodies, Kurama watched eagerly as he ate his cake.  Slowly but surely, the zipper teeth at the bottom of Naruto's hoodie began to pry themselves free from one another.  Bit by bit, just a little brief bit of Naruto's blue T-Shirt as well as a sliver of flesh from Naruto's stomach began to expose themselves from beneath the hoodie, as the zipper teeth had broken off one another past the point below Naruto's waist, and were now beginning to work upward towards Naruto's stomach as he continued greedily scarfing down his muffins.  Kurama smiled gleefully all the way, so distracted that his forkful of cake would occasionally miss his mouth and instead, accidentally smear a bit of chocolate cake on his muzzle, much to the amusement of the others.  But Kurama simply giggled and licked it off as he continued watching his blonde pal eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after one particularly forceful gulp, Naruto stopped for a moment, and leaned back in his chair, groaning just slightly.  Seeing that, Kurama's smile faded as he glanced at Naruto with a bit of a concerned look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, Naruto, you OK?\" the young kit asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut much to his alarm, the boy groaned a bit more audibly as he rested both hands against his bloated belly and clutched it with a notably discomforted look on his face.  \"Ohhhh, my stomach...\" complained Naruto, \"...think I might'uh overdone it with that last bit...\"  Kiba simply snorted and said, \"Well, that's what'chu get for bein' cocky, bonehead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Naruto paid no heed to the dog nin, instead, his groaning grew a bit more audible as he rubbed at his belly tenderly in an effort to coax the pain away to no avail.  Seeing this, Hunter frowned slightly and said, \"Y'know, it's no competition, Naruto, if ya gotta take a break, there's no harm in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Naruto frowned a bit and glanced back at Kurama.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, s-sorry, pal...guess the reveal ain't gonna be so awesome afterall...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, Kurama stopped eating and placed an arm atop Naruto's shoulder in a brotherly assuring manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, don't give up, Naruto!  Remember when I got that really bad tummyache trying to push my belly button out?  I was being a big baby because I didn't think I could do it.  But you said I could.  You said I could push through the pain and I did!  Since we met, every time I didn't think I could do something, you always knew I could.  You believed in me.\"  Then, he smiled warmly at Naruto as he said, \"Well, I believe in YOU, Naruto!  I know you can fight through the pain, not cause you're awesome, but cause you're strong!\"  His smile grew a bit more impish as he added, \"Heehee...'sides, once you bust your hoodie, think'uh all the room y'er tummy'll have more more goodies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after wincing a bit in pain, Naruto glanced back at the kit, thought for a moment and said, \"Rgh, y-y'know what?  You're damn right!  I ain't about to let a lil tummyache keep me from all this good stuff!\"  He then glanced a bit more thoughtfully at Kurama and rested a hand on his shoulder.  \"And if YOU think I can do it, then I know I can!\"  He then proceeded to ruffle Kurama's head playfully as the young kyuubi beamed happily and giggled as he rubbed the back of his fuzzy head and added, \"Awww, thanks!\"  But Naruto just smiled back and said, \"No, thank YOU, Kurama.  You're a great friend.\"  At that, Kurama smiled warmly, as did the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Heh, oh man, now he's got the fuzzball rootin' for him to stuff his craw?</i>  Kiba thought, unable to suppress a smirk at the genuine warmth the two had for each other.  <i>Well, bonehead, better not let your pal down then.</i>  He then resumed eating, now glancing back occasionally at the sight as well, as did Hunter and Akamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just glanced back at the table, still wincing a bit from the discomfort his stomach was causing him.  He needed to find a way to bust his hoodie as fast as possible.  On one hand, the muffins were definitely getting results, but on the other, his tummy was in agony as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after some thinking, (a feat Akamaru still didn't believe possible for Naruto) the boy decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With newfound vigor (and an odd warmth in his chest that intensified whenever he glanced at Kurama's gleeful, encouraging expression,) Naruto continued scarfing down his muffins even faster than before. Crumbs flew every which way as he crammed one after the other into his waiting  waiting mouth, his cheeks bulging as he chewed just enough to gulp them down. He winced as they plopped into his already-stuffed belly, but he ignored the pain and kept on shoveling the baked goods into his maw. Kurama had faith in him; he couldn't give up now! As he ate, Kiba, Hunter, and Akamaru all watched; they still ate their desserts, of course, but they had slowed down a good bit, their attention focused on Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, it wasn't long before his tummy started growing again, bulging outwards ever so slightly with every muffin consumed. And, of course, it wasn't long his hoodie began showing the effects of this continued growth. Starting from right above the sliver of blue shirt that was exposed, the teeth once again began popping apart. Naruto, feeling this slight release in pressure, grinned and redoubled his assault, cramming muffin after muffin into his mouth. And, as he did so, the teeth of his hoodie continued breaking apart, releasing a slight <i>pop</i> every time a few ripped apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama watched with rapt attention, his eyes following the hoodie's zipper upward as each set of teeth pried themselves apart. \"Woooowww....\" the kit muttered, eyes gleaming. \"Keep going, Naruto! You're doing great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Naruto smiled warmly at the young Tailed Beast, and promptly began going even faster. Slowly, more and more of the teeth of his hoodie pried themselves apart, revealing more and more of the blue-shirted stomach underneath. At this point, every part of the hoodie underneath the middle of his belly was popped apart....but Naruto, never one to rest on his laurels, didn't let up for even a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate and ate, wincing and fighting through the pain as his tummy continued to bulge. To his annoyance, he hadn't managed to pop any more teeth apart; at least, until he crammed a couple more in, at which point the teeth started popping again...though oddly enough, the teeth holding themselves together right at the center of his belly still held, the teeth above those starting to go instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter raised an eyebrow, even as he took a huge bite of a cream doughnut (and marveled inwardly at the wonderful taste). <i>Huh...that's kinda weird...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, he grinned; once those few teeth in the middle went...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to Hunter's inner musings, Naruto continued his gorging, the teeth of his hoodie continuing their inexorable march upward as the teeth above the middle of his belly pried themselves  apart, revealing more and more of his shirt. This went for for several minutes, the boy continued to stuff his face and the teeth continuing to pop apart, piece by piece. All the while, the teeth that were still holding up the fort in the middle of his belly grew tighter and tighter, constricting his tummy rather uncomfortably...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as Naruto downed a blueberry muffin, he groaned and leaned back in his chair, clutching his tummy. \"Oh man... my gut feels so tight...\"<br>\r\nAs the others looked at the blonde boy, they could certainly believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the teeth of his hoodie, save for the ones in the middle of his belly and the ones covering his chest, had popped apart, revealing his swollen, shirt-clad tummy above and below the holdouts. His shirt had started hiking up a bit further, but seeing as it was still being held back by his hoodie, it hadn't gone that far up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winced as another bolt of pain shot through his belly. \"Owwww.....\" He clutched his belly tighter, squeezing his eyes shut as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened. \"N-Naruto? A-are you OK...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening one eye, he looked over at Kurama. \"Y-yeah, I'm fine,\" he assured the kit. \"Just, uh, just kinda a tight fit is all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinked. \"Naruto, you sure you don't wanna take a break?\" the wolf asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Yeah; last thing I wanna hear is you bitchin' about how much your tummy hurts.\" In spite of the harsh words, Akamaru could clearly see the concern in his best pal's eyes and hear it in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sat up a bit, glaring at the dog-nin. \"L-like I'd give you the satisfaction, dog breath...\" Suddenly, he groaned, once again leaning back in his chair and massaging his tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, seeing this, whimpered a bit. \"C-c'mon, Naruto,\" the little Nine-Tails piped, \"you can't give up now!\" He gestured to NAruto's belly. \"I mean, lookit how far you've come already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winced. \"I-I know, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it hurts a lot,\" Kurama cut in, \"but it really hurt when I was eating that sundae too! I was ready to give up, but you told me I could do it, told me my tummy hurting would be worth it...and it was! When my belly-button popped out and the pressure went away, it...it was the most amazingest thing I've ever felt!\" Grinning now, Kurama placed a paw on Naruto's shoulder. \"But I never coulda done it if you hadn't believed in me!\" He gave Naruto a little shake. \"So now I'M believing in you, and I'm telling ya, once you break your hoodie...\" Kurama giggled and winked at the blonde. \"...it's gonna be worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, fighting back the pain, looked over at the young fox, eyes widened. <i>Kurama...do you...do you really have that much faith in me...?</i> His eyes started misting up a bit, but he forced it back; the last thing he wanted to do was start crying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's and Akamaru's eyes widened. <i>Wow,</i> Akamaru yipped. <i>That's...that's really sweet...</i> Kiba, unable to repress a goofy smile, only nodded. <i>Man, they really ARE tight, aren't they...</i> thte dog-nin thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stared at the two, his chest hitching a bit. <i>He's...he's such a sweet, genuine little fella...</i> he thought. Scowling a bit, he clenched his paws over his trousers. <i>It's not fair...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at Kurama a few seconds longer...before he broke out in a huge grin. \"Well, when ya put it like that...\" Thumping Kurama playfully on the shoulder, he went right back to his muffins, ignoring the pain as he ingested more and more baked goods. Bigger and bigger his tummy bulged, and tighter and tighter the few remaining teeth on his belly grew....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grunted. <i>Just a...little...more...</i> Determination gleaming in his eyes, he grabbed a banana muffin, opened wide, crammed it in his mouth, chewed, swallowed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and that was the final straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>POP!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an explosive pop, the remaining teeth on his belly finally burst apart.  As this happened, the bursting of the teeth had started a chain reaction that went up to the teeth on his chest, causing them to rip apart as well. Subsequently, both sides of his now-broken hoodie flew out to either side of him (and whapped Kurama in the face.) His belly, now freed from the constraint of his hoodie, surged forward, his blue t-shirt sliding up a good deal and exposing a considerable amount of skin, stoppping just below his belly-button. His hoodie, having broken apart down the middle, now framed his tummy like a long vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto let out a gasp. \"Oh...oh MAN!\" He exclaimed, slumping back in his chair and contentedly patting his belly. \"That felt amazing...\" Grinning, he looked over at Kurama. Puzzling a bit at why Kurama was rubbing his cheek a bit, he nonetheless asked, \"Well? What didja think, Kurama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping his massage of the spot where the hoodie had whacked him, Kurama stared at Naruto...before breaking out in a massive grin. \"That was AWESOME, Naruto!\" The young kit exclaimed, beaming. \"I knew you could do it!\" Then, before Naruto could react, he leaned forward and wrapped his arms around Naruto in a big hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit taken off guard, Naruto nonetheless smiled and returned the embrace. \"Hey, I couldn'ta done it if you hadn't believed in me.\" Kurama giggled a bit bashfully, but continued the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinked dully at the sight, not sure whether he should be gushing at how awesome Naruto busting his hoodie apart was, or melting at the sheer warmth the boy and young Tailed Beast exuded as they hugged each other. <i>Awwwwww......</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, unable to help himself, smiled at the sight. <i>Well, doesn't that just give ya the warm n' fuzzies?</i> Akamaru, of a similar opinion, barked and wagged his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Naruto and Kurama disengaged their hugged, though they still grinned at each other. \"Well,\" Naruto spoke up, rubbing his tummy. \"I dunno about you, buddy, but I feel like I could eat WAY more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama squirmed and giggled. \"Heh heh, me too!\" Then, before Naruto could reply, he promptly dove back into his cake. Naruto, a bit taken off guard, nonetheless grinned and resumed devouring his muffins.  Taking  the hint, Kiba, Akamaru, and Hunter resumed tearing into their desserts as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was as though everyone had been given newfound vigor.  For all five tore into their baked delights with extreme speed and glee, purely on account of the sheer amount of flavor emanating from every bite.  With Naruto's belly liberated from the confines of his now busted hoodie / vest, his stomach was free to expand outward with each muffin wolfed down.  So much so, that between the five, it was now Naruto whose tummy had expanded to the biggest, and it seemed to stay the biggest as he continued to pack away one muffin after another, no longer showing any signs of flagging like before.  Much of which; if not all entirely, he owed to his little orange furred friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he seamlessly consumed one muffin after another, he couldn't take his attention off of young Kurama, watching him just oh so happily tear into his cake with this undeniable innocence and downright adorable glee on his merry mug.  He was such a kind, caring creature, and an absolutely wonderful friend.  And the more apparent that became, the harder it was...knowing it wouldn't last.  It was maddening, and tore Naruto up inside, much like it did Hunter.  But, for Kurama's sake, he wasn't about to let that sadness get the better of him.  Rather, he was gonna have the most damn fun he could possibly have with his new pal, making the absolute most of their time together...however painfully brief it would eventually be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, he ate, and ate with a gleeful smile on his face.  More and more, each passing muffin caused Naruto's belly to swell up, pressing firmly against the front of his pants, and raising up his shirt enough to show a bit of his belly button.  Kurama fared near the same, his own spiral flame symbol shirt rising up and exposing more and more of his orange furred tummy, now free from his pants button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grunted for a moment, resting a hand on his own immensely bloated tummy and said, \"Oh man, damn pants're gettin' snug like nobodies business...\"  Hunter winced for a moment as well.  \"Ngh, h-heh...same here...\" he remarked, as the two reached over their massive bellies, trying to undo their pants...unable to reach over their massively swollen guts.  Seeing this, Naruto grinned toothily and said, \"Pfft, what, you two're tryin' to take the easy way out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Kiba rolled his eyes and said, \"No, bonehead...we just don't wanna have to run around this place holdin' our guts AND our pants up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned back and patted his belly proudly as he said, \"Hehe, sorry, but I think our guts're a LITTLE too big for us to reach over at this point.\"  He then turned to Kurama and playfully nudged his arm.  \"Cept for Kurama here, who was smart enough to think ahead.\"  At that, Kurama giggled and rubbed the back of his head bashfully.  His grin grew more impish as he turned back to the others and said, \"For us?  I'm thinkin' we only got one option for gettin' rid'uh the tightness our pants're causin'...if ya catch my drift...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Kiba and Hunter shared a glance, then, smirked a bit more impishly themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching that, Akamaru whined to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Greaaaaaat...whelp, it was nice not having a welt on my rump when it lasted...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to Akamaru's musing, Naruto glanced down at a pitcher of cola and pulled one closely to his side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing too, cause all those muffins've got me parched!\" Naruto exclaimed.  Both Kiba and Hunter raised an eyebrow in unison, and nevertheless, grabbed a pitcher of cola each as well.  Before long, the trio held their pitchers up (Naruto and Kiba needing to hold theirs with two hands while Hunter only held his with one), and once Hunter had exclaimed, \"Cheers, boys!\" the trio; in unison, brought their pitchers to their lips, and proceeded to chug away heartily, causing their guts to continue bloating forward against their pants, much to Kurama's amusement as he stopped eating cake, and decided to join in, grabbing a pitcher himself, about to chug away...when he stopped, and thought for a moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...He then proceeded to grin a bit mischievously himself...forming an idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to this, the trio continued onward, chugging heartily, until they lowered their pitchers to catch their breath, and in unison, let out tremendously loud belches each.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, that hit the spot!\" Naruto exclaimed merrily, patting his belly heartily and letting out another loud burp as a result.  He giggled and was about to bring the pitcher back up, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone jumped back in their seats (or table top in Akamaru's case) utterly startled as a truly massive belch rocked the table and everyone sitting at (or on) it.  Immediately, all parties turned their attention to the source of said noise, and found Kurama, giggling as he wiped his mouth of what looked like...foam...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, GOOD-\"  Again, Naruto stopped mid sentence as his eyes drifted towards Kurama's beverage, \"...one...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Kiba was about to ask Naruto what was wrong, when he saw where Naruto's eyes were directed.  Suddenly, he too, was befuddled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr...Kurama...?\" Naruto began as he pointed to his pitcher, \"...what is that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's pitcher was a light, foamy and fizzy brown, with light brown foam rising at the top.  Smiling, he held his pitcher up; with both hands, much to Hunter's joy, seeing how damn adorable the little fella looked doing so, then explained, \"Oh!  Uhh, well, see, Miss Anju's soda tasted so very yummy, right?  And I wanted to chug with you guys too, even though my pants aren't holding my tummy back!\"  His grin grew somewhat more mischievous as he pointed to one of the milkshakes.  \"But THEN...I remembered how ultra super duper yummy Mister Rocket's milkshakes tasted...and I didn't know which one I wanted to drink more, so I just...mixed 'em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys stared deadpanned for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mixed 'em...?\" they asked in unison, unsure how to feel about that.  Hunter, however, smiled warmly and reached over to ruffle the kits' head, much to his amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, this kid's on a roll, ain't he!\"  He turned to the others and said, \"You see, boys, what young little Kurama here has done, is improve on the classic 'ice cream float'...and created....a milkshake float!\"  Much like Kurama had been doing earlier, the two boys just tilted their heads, utterly lost.  Rolling his eyes, Hunter instead, smirked and poured some of his soda into a pitcher of milkshake, offering it to the boys.  \"See for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit cautiously, Naruto reached over and grabbed the pitcher, taking a brief sip as he put the pitcher down and let Kiba take a sip as well.  The dog nin put the pitcher down as well, giving him and the blonde some time to process the taste, which clearly didn't take long as smiles began rising over their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap...\" Kiba remarked, smacking his lips.  \"That's...that's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the best drink I've ever TASTED!!\" blurted Naruto, much to Kurama's amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kit giggled some more and said, \"Awww, it's no big deal, I just couldn't decide-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-So you made two things that were already awesome even AWESOME...er!\" replied Naruto as he wrapped his arm around Kurama's neck brotherly and playfully ruffled his head, making him giggle and squirm equally playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I dunno bout'chu, boys, but I think I've found a tastier way'uh bustin' our buttons.  Agreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in unison, the trio poured more soda into milkshake pitchers, until they foamed over into milkshake floats as well.  \"Once again, the trio held their pitchers up, but waited as they all turned to Kurama, who smiled warmly and raised his right along with them merrily, and in unison, all four proceeded to chug away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Akamaru's tail wagged happily at the sight, seeing all four getting along so well...but shuddered nevertheless as he continued to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ugh...three outta four...that's still gonna hurt like hell...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to this, the four continued chugging away relentlessly as their tummies continued to swell and swell...</span></div></div>",

As he did so, he glanced down at his orange-furred tummy and grinned. <i>Oh, wow!</i> the kit thought excitedly. <i>Not only is this yummy, but it's makin' my tummy grow really, really fast!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, his midsection had swollen up even further, pushing further out and forcing his flame spiral shirt even further up, the spiral getting noticeably scrunched up and distorted. Throwing glances around at the others, he giggled. <i>Hee hee, and it's makin' everyone else's tummies get really big, too!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's furry belly had also swollen up noticeably, forcing his shirt up noticeably, starting to reveal his furred-over belly-button. Kiba's shirt had also risen as well, showing a little more of his navel than Hunter's. And Naruto...well, considering he'd gotten further than any of them, his shirt was now well above his belly-button, and was noticeably rounder and larger than any of theirs, pushing out past his opened hoodie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned. <i>Oh wow, they're all doing so good, even if Naruto's ahead.</i> He sighed happily. <i>Not surprised Naruto's furthest along, though. He's the coolest...</i> Giggling a bit, he lifted the pitcher back up to his muzzle, chugging away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo engrossed was he in the flavors and creamy texture of the float, he did not realize that his pants zipper, already pushed all the way down by his ever-growing belly, was starting to feel increasingly tight as the appendage continued to grow and push against it. And, as Kurama chugged away, that pressure only grew more and more, the front of his pants creaking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Kurama lowered his pitcher (still at least a quarter full) and looked down at his swollen tummy. <i>Huh, why do the front of my pants feel so tight? I mean, they're already unbuttoned and unzippered and everything?</i> Shrugging, he lifted his pitcher back up to his muzzle, and continued chugging, chugging, chugging...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rrrrrriiiiiip.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes flew wide open at the sound cutting through the air, and at the release of pressure in the front of his pants. <i>Huh?</i> The others, having heard the noise, lowered their own pitchers and glanced over at the young kit. Hunter blinked. <i>Was that...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Kurama set his pitcher down, scooted back from the table a bit, felt around where he'd felt the release in pressure....and his fuzzy face promptly turned as red as a tomato. <i>Oh no...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, though his own engorged tummy prevented him from seeing much, he was sitting in such a position that the rest of his friends could clearly see that, yes, there was a rather sizable tear down his zipper, clearly exposing some of his undergarments, which appeared to be some sort of light blue boxer-briefs dotted with two different patterns: one of regular leaves, and another of what appeared to be a rather styilzed drawing of a leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kiba, and Akamaru all squinted at the symbol. <i>Wait, is that...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to all of this, Kurama frantically moved his hands over the tear, concealing it as best he could. \"U-um,\" he stammered, his face reddening even more. \"S-sorry about that; I-I mean, I felt my pants getting tight, but it twas so YUMMY, a-and I couldn't stop, a-and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened as Naruto slugged him lightly in the shoulder, laughing. A bit confused, Kurama looked over at his friend. \"N-Naruto, what's so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickering, Naruto replied, \"S-sorry, pal; just seein' ya get so flustered at ripping your pants....\" Coughing, he gave the kit what he hoped was a warm smile, even as he continued to chuckle. \"A-heh.. but I told ya, ya don't gotta be embarrassed about that stuff around us. Ain't like we haven't ripped our pants before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blinked. \"Y-yeah, but...\" Flushing a bit, he felt around his exposed undergarments. \"...n-now you can see my underwear. A-and I know this is my first time wearin' ANY kinda clothes, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba gave a dismissive snort. \"What, like the bonehead and I haven't seen each others' before during these sorta things?\" He smirked. \"'Sides, they're pretty cool lookng, 'specially, those symbols...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked, wagging his tail. <i>Yeah; that's the symbol of our village.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened as he looked at the pup. \"I-it is...?\" Laughing a bit nervously, he scratched the back of his head. \"Heh, I-I just thought they looked cool...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled, patting his pal on the back. \"Well, I gotta say, you've got really good taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama turned to Naruto, smiling widely. \"Ya really think so?\" Naruto said nothing, but gave a big, enthusiastic nod in response. \"W-well gee, I didn't think you guys would like it THAT much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled. \"Eh, don't sell yourself short, kiddo; like Naruto said, ya got good taste in clothes, 'specially considering you've never worn 'em before.\" Kurama beamed widely at this. Hunter smiled at this. <i>Ah, much better.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the others, he grinned impishly. \"Well, boys, I dunno about you, but I think it'd hardly be fair if we didn't try to push our pants as far as Kurama did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked at the wolf-person. \"You mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded. \"Yep! After we bust our buttons, I say we do our damnedest to bust our pants, too!\" He smiled warmly at the little Nine-Tails. \"Let's not leave the little guy alone, eh?\" Then, before any of them could reply (he could guess what their answer would be, anyway), he picked his pitcher back up and started chugging. Spluttering at the head start, Naruto and Kiba glared at Hunter and began chugging away themselves. Kurama, watching, giggled. <i>Well, they're giving it their all, too; guess I should too!</i> Kicking his legs a bit in glee, he continued chugging as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru shrugged. <i>Well, so long as they're doing it...</i> Wagging his tail, he continued lapping up his float with relish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to chug, the three biped's pants buttons continued to strain until, finally, they started to fray...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In unison, all five sitting at the table (or sitting ON the table in Akamaru's case) were chugging (and lapping) away at their delightful pitchers of milkshake floats.  Both Naruto and Kiba were grinning competitively as they chugged and chugged away as vigorously as the two youths possibly could.  Hunter; though a bit competitive in his gaze himself, had a more impish look on his face, even as he powered through his shake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd little Kurama?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young fix kit continued chugging merry as can be, with his hind legs kicking happily, his eyes squinted shut and a big, ample smile across his muzzle as more and more of his milkshake float continued to fill his already rounded and orange furred tummy up considerably.  And all the while letting out a sweet little giggle of sheer delight as he did so.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a good while, it seemed as though Hunter had taken the lead, with his brown furred belly pushing against his pants further and further.  However, the moment he took his eyes off the shake and paid notice to the young Tailed Beast squiggling and kicking in sheer joy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, great Odin's raven...!!  Being that adorable isn't friggin' fair...!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought to himself, unable to chug away at full vigor, with such a positively adorable sight distracting him and once again causing his heart to skip a beat or two...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to this, both Naruto and Kiba soldiered on, chugging away to their hearts content as both their tummies continued to swell up more and more to rather obscene proportions, pressing firmer and firmer against their pants.  Eventually, the two found themselves wincing a bit in discomfort as their bellies began to feel constricted by the front of their respective pants, at about an even pace, both with strained expressions as they pressed on and on and on and on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil finally, Kiba stopped for but a moment to catch his breath, wiping his mouth with his forearm as he saw the especially strained look on Naruto's face and grinned confidently; if somewhat weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh, having trouble there, bonehead?\" he taunted.  Surprisingly, however, Naruto didn't stop to respond with a \"witty\" comeback.  Rather, with a strangely confident grin, he leaned back a bit as some of his milkshake frosty began to spill a bit to the sides of his mouths, and chugged more vigorously than ever.  Even Hunter, Akamaru and Kurama especially stopped to take notice of this, watching almost in awe as the blonde boy chugged away ever relentlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Woooooooow, lookit him go...!</i> Kurama thought, giving his friend his undivided attention, wanting to cheer him on with every fiber of his being, but opting against it, in case he inadvertently distracted his buddy like he 'thought he did' last time with their soda chugging contest.  Instead, he watched silently but eagerly.  Akamaru, on the other hand, watched rather cautiously, whimpering slightly as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Notmybacksidenotmybacksideoh PLEASE not my backside...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken back, Kiba was about to grab his pitcher and catch up with him, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*POP!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe button to the front of Naruto's pants snapped clean off, bouncing off a vase in the distance, and followed by another, and another...ricocheting almost without end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, in that singular instance, Naruto's already ample belly, now liberated by the constraints of his pants button, surged outward exponentially as the zipper teeth of his pants tethered to make more room for his bloated tummy, which caused his shirt and hoodie to hike upward a good few inches above his belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, there we go!\" exclaimed Naruto with a hearty sigh as he practically went limp in his chair, before letting out a tremendously loud belch and chuckling as he gave his belly a few hearty and proud pats before wiping his mouth clean of frosty residue, all the while, the button still shot from place to place, much to everyone else's bewilderment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...that is...until it bounced off Naruto's pitcher and pegged Kiba square in the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH!\" yelped the young dog-nin as his head snapped back and his hands immediately clutched his forehead, rubbing it tenderly and grumbling angrily shortly after.  Akamaru snickered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hehe, sorry, buddy...buuuuuuuuut better you than me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Hunter gave Naruto a thumbs up.  \"Heh, not bad, kiddo.  Not bad at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, on the other hand, was beaming so much, one would think it was HIS button flying off again.  \"Not bad?  That was AWESOME!  Just when it looked like it could have been either one'uh you, you just kept goin' and goin' and goin' until your pants button just went WHOOSH!  And did'ja see how long it was bouncin' all over the place?  And lookit how big your tummy is now!  That was...that was just amazing, Naruto!  I knew ya could do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his attention to his young fox kit companion, Naruto smiled warmly at Kurama's excitement and joy for him.  \"Heh, you're somethin' else, Kurama,\" the boy exclaimed, reaching over and playfully ruffling Kurama's head, earning a giggle from the young creature.  Even Kiba; despite a button-like welt on his forehead, was unable to suppress a smirk at the orange fuzzball's happiness for his blonde friend.  And Hunter...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Must...keep...heart...GOING!</i> thought the wolf as he thumped his chest again and again with each passing beat, only to stop and realize the four youths had stopped what they were doing and were now gazing curiously at the anthro, with all their respective heads tilted in confusion.  Stopping for a moment, he chuckled, rubbing the back of his head sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh hehe...sorry, thought I...had heartburn for a second there...er something...\" he stumbled to come up with a response.  But luckily, he shook it off and turned to Kiba.  \"Err...a-anyway, I dunno bout'chu, but I'd like to give my gut some breathing room here like those two got.  So how about we fix that and bust these buttons?\"  Kiba grinned confidently and proceeded to chug away at his pitcher without a seconds hesitation, earning a chuckle from Hunter as he did the same.  Once again, Akamaru recoiled, seeing their buttons tether little by little as both their bellies continued to swell out, getting more and more constricted to their lower attires...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*POP!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*POP!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn unison, both Hunter's and Kiba's buttons snapped clean off and ricocheted mid air against each other before flying back at either side and just barely missing Naruto and Kurama, who ducked just in time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...only for them to bounce right back and nail them both in the back of their heads, causing the two youths to yelp at the same time, clutching their heads in pain while both Hunter's and Kiba's bellies surged outward in the same vein as Naruto, causing their shirts to hike up and their zippers to give way as their tummies had been released of their confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh mama Mia, that's so much better...!\" exclaimed Hunter merrily, tongue hanging from the side of his muzzle as he slouched in his chair right alongside Kiba who did the same.  Kiba burped loudly after and was about to excuse himself when he saw both Naruto and Kurama still rubbing the back of their heads tenderly, then, his grin widened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha!  Guess what goes around, comes around, don't it, bonehead?\"  teased Kiba, earning a roll of the eyes from Naruto while Hunter glanced a bit more apologetically at the orange fox kit and said, \"H-heh, sorry about that, little guy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Kurama; still rubbing his head, gave Hunter a good natured smile and said, \"Awww, it's okay.  That was awesome too!  Heehee, did'ja see the way your buttons just hit each other mid air before bouncin' around and hittin' us?\"  Despite himself, even Naruto couldn't help but chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, yeah, that actually was pretty cool,\" the blonde added, earning some soft chuckles all around while Akamaru sighed tremendously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'd like to thank all of your heads for taking the button instead of my rump...seriously...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the anthro, the dog-nin and fox kit all laughed heartily, earning a confused glance from Naruto...who eventually...just shrugged and laughed along with his pals for a good while until they all began to wind down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, whelp, I dunno bout'chu, boys'n pups, but now, I feel like putting all this freed up space to some good use...and what better use than stuffin' our craws with as much of these bad boys as we possibly can?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrins all around, no one needed to be told twice before digging right back in for more baked goodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as this carried on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As one, Naruto, Hunter, Kiba, Kurama, and Akamaru continued ripping into their baked goods, cramming as many into their mouths at a time as they could. Not due to any haste or sense of competition, mind; the treats were simply THAT delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mmmm...man!</i> Hunter thought gleefully as he popped a doughnut into his mouth, chewing the whole thing (and grinning at the wonderful taste). <i>Who'da thought Rocket was such a kick-ass baker?</i> Then, as he gulped down that mouthful and went for another doughnut, he grinned as another thought occurred to him. <i>Wonder how Quill and the others would react if they found out their resident grumpy, gun-toting raccoon was a master chef?</i> He sniggered a bit, even as he filed that thought away into his brain in the 'possible future blackmail' department. Thankfully, the others didn't notice, as they were too preoccupied with stuffing their faces with Rocket's wonderfully tasty baked goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to dig into the baked goods, their stomachs swelled up more and more. Naruto, Kiba,  and Kurama's shirts continued to slide upward as their bellies, no longer constrained by their pants buttons, pushed forward, growing with every baked good inhaled. Akamaru's tummy, in the meantime, rounded out and reached further and further beneath him, getting very close to the table. <i>Huh, gettin' pretty big,</i> Akamaru thought offhandedly as he tore into a peach pie. <i>Probably gonna look like a beach ball by the time I'm done....</i> To his shock, he found he didn't mind in the slightest; at least, not so long as that was the price for being able to wolf down these heavenly concoctions....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, however, winced as he continued to eat; though he wasn't slowing down, and in spite of the fact that his button was gone and his pants were unzipped, he could feel something hard and unyielding constricting his furry tummy. <i>The hell?</i> the anthro thought, frowning as he maneuvered one of his paws down to his waistline. <i>Why does my stomach still feel...</i> His eyes widened as his paw contacted the cold meta of his belt buckle, and the hard leather of the belt itself. <i>...oh. Almost forgot about that...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scratched the back of his head, even as he grabbed a cookie and began munching on it. <i>But how the heck was my button able to fly off the way it did?</i> He shrugged. <i>Eh, probably loosened it at some point, and that gave it some room...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, his belt was extremely tight now, and loosening it probably wouldn't do much good. <i>Besides,</i> Hunter thought, absentmindedly patting his bulbous furry tummy, <i>size my gut is now, there's now way in hell I'd be able to reach it...</i> He scowled a bit, cramming a muffin into his mouth so the others wouldn't see. <i>Damn it! I wanna eat as much of this stuff as I can, but if this belt's in the way, there's no way I can...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly snapped bolt upright, eyes widening. <i>Wait,</i> Hunter thought, a smile slowly coming to his muzzle. <i>Yeah, that might work...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter was having his little epiphany, Kurama noticed that Hunter wasn't eating. Gulping down a mouthful of pound cake, he looked up at the anthro, tilting his head. \"M-Mister Hunter?\" the kit asked tentatively. \"A-are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the young fox's voice, Hunter shook his head and looked at him, smiling warmly. \"Yeah, I'm OK, kid. It's just....\" He smiled mischievously at this, intentionally stopping at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blinked quizzically. \"Just what, Mister Hunter?\" At this, Naruto, Kiba, and Akamaru slowed down a bit, looking at the anthro curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirkred. \"Weeeelllll....\" he began, eyes gleaming. \"You enjoyed it when the three of us busted our buttons, didn'tcha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama beamed, nodding eagerly. \"Yeah! It was so awesome! I mean, the way they just flew off, and were flying all over the place, like ZOOM...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled, even as his heart skipped a beat. \"W-well, how would you like to see something even cooler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened in surprise; what could possibly be cooler than Mister Hunter busting his button?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing he had the kit's attention, Hunter continued.on. \"Tell me, kiddo; you ever seen someone bust their belt before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama tilted his head. \"Th-their belt...?\" he questioned softly. At this, Naruto, Kiba, and Akamaru exchanged glances; they'd almost forgotten the wolf had been wearing a belt, much less that it was still intact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter beamed, his tail wagging. \"Trust me, kid; you're in for a treat.\" Then, before Kurama could reply, the wolf dove back into his baked goods, shoveling as many as he could chew at a time into his mouth. The youths all continued eating, albeit at a slower pace than before. Not due to any flagging, mind; they were focusing on Hunter. Naruto, Kiba, and Akamaru simply wondered if the wolf could really bust his belt like he'd said. Kurama, though, was watching with a huge grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow,</i> the kit thought, squirming in his seat from anticipation, <i>This is gonna be so cool...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking as he saw the kit's eager face, Hunter shoveled ever more treats into his muzzle, going faster and faster. Occasionally, he would pause to catch his breath or take a swig of milkshake float, but was otherwise completely relentless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime drew on, and Hunter's stomach only continued to swell, pushing more and more against his belt. <i>Grrr...</i> Hunter growled inwardly. <i>Come...on...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting his teeth, he took a particularly large bite of blueberry pie...and was rewarded with the sound of a slight tearing in his belt. <i>Yes! Finally!</i> Grinning, he renewed his assault, shoving ever more treats into his maw, tail wagging as more tears slowly began to ring through the air as the leather continued to finally succumb to the pressure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four youths leaned forward (or at least, as much as their engorged tummies would allow them), watching with anticipation. <i>Oh boy,</i> Kurama thought, tails swishing in anticipation, <i>Mister Hunter's really doin' good!</i> He beamed. <i>Oooh...I wonder what its gonna be like when his belt finally gives...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting in determination, Hunter powered on, not wanting to let Kurama down. More and more his belly grew, and more and more his belt tore, until, finally, he started to hear the metal of his belt cracking. Grinning, he ate faster and faster, shoveling more and more sweets into his mouth. His belt buckle continued to crack, beginning to give under the pressure his fuzzy belly was exerting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter winced. <i>Just...a little...more...</i> Steeling himself, he leaned back in his seat, shoved a particularly large muffin into his mouth, chewed, gulped the whole thing down....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*SNAP!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...until, finally, with a splintering of metal and a tearing of leather, his belt buckle <i>SHOT</i> off his waist, flying straight over Naruto and Kurama's heads, and impacting straight into the opposite wall, sending up a shower of splinters and dust...and staying wedged there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the exact same instance, his already engorged belly SURGED forward, pushing closer to the table, hiking his shirt up even further...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiip.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n....and, with a loud tearing noise, the front of his khaki pants ripped wide open, exposing his black, crescent-moon emblazoned boxers for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kiba, and Akamaru gaped at Hunter, unable to believe exactly how much force his belly had exerted upon being freed. Kurama, on the other hand, had a huge, toothy grin on his face. <i>That. Was. Awesome.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with sweet relief, Hunter slouched back in his chair, resting his paws on his bulging tummy. Then, looking up at the others, he smiled, licked his chops, and said, \"So, boys? What didja think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four youths exchanged surprised glances. Then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a moment of silence, Kurama beamed with an ample abundance of excitement and exclaimed, \"That.  Was.  AWESOME!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how absolutely packed his overstuffed orange furred tummy was, Kurama was giddy enough to practically hop up and down in his seat; albeit just slightly, much to the amusement of the other youths, while Hunter couldn't help but gush internally at how precious the little fella looked doing that.  \"Did-didja SEE that?!  Your belt buckle was strapped TIGHT on your tummy!  B-but then!  Your tummy just got bigger and bigger and bigger until KABOOM!  It just SHOT right off your tummy and then went FOOM through the air!  And then!  And then...BAM!  RIGHT into the wall!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama raved on and on, all the while, physically motioning with his arms to accentuate each point, until he stopped and noticed Hunter biting on his fist and turning away.  Confused, the young fox kit tilted his head curiously and asked, \"S-somethin' wrong, Mister Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HNNNNNNNNG...n-no...n-nothinwrongkiddo!\" was all the wolf could sputter externally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So...freakin'...cute...!  Brain...force quitting...relaunching...relaunching again...!  Oh dear sweet beard of Santa...relaunching again!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys simply gaped deadpanned and dumbfounded, until both Naruto and Kiba snickered to each other as something else once again caught their attention...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, wolfy!\" interjected Kiba, snapping Hunter out of his state of delirium as he cleared his throat and turned to the young dog-nin.  \"What's up, kiddo?\" asked the wolf.  Rather than respond verbally, however, Kiba pointed downward beneath Hunter's immensely swollen belly.  Confused for a moment, Hunter reached down; best as he could over his rounded tummy, until his eyes widened, having felt what Kiba was addressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh...\" he muttered, face reddening beneath his fur as the two young ninja boys began to snicker a little bit, much to Hunter's embarrassment. Kurama on the other hand, caught this and after a moment, giggled aloud, but not at Hunter's expense, rather, it was something of a more playful laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee, you don't hafta be embarrassed because ya tore your pants, Mister Hunter!  Remember what'cha told me?  It happens all the time!  Besides, I actually think that moon pattern looks pretty neat!\"  Embarrassment dissipating a moment, Hunter couldn't help but smirk a bit at the young fox's remarks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, ya think so?\" asked the wolf, to which the young Tailed-Beast instantly bobbed his head up and down affirmatively, and with a smile on his fuzzy face, earning a more relaxed smile from Hunter's own muzzle.  \"Heh, thanks, kiddo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Naruto couldn't help but smile back at Kurama's kind words as he playfully nudged the young creature in the arm and added, \"He's got a point, it WAS pretty damn awesome!  I mean, that thing was freakin' METAL...I can't believe you managed to eat so much so fast your gut managed to bust it!  Hell, I don't think even I could do that...\"  Then the boy's smile grew more impish as he rubbed his own bloated tummy eagerly and said, \"Buuuuuuuut doesn't mean I can't try sometime...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just rolled his eyes at Naruto's remark and added, \"Hate to say it, but bonehead DOES have a point...\" and to that point, Kiba literally pointed back to where the metal buckle had been lodged in the wall behind them.  \"Look at how damn deep that thing went in!  I mean...even I gotta admit that that's pretty badass, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if to add on this, Akamaru yipped happily in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't even WANT to imagine how bad it would'a hurt if that thing had pegged me...</i> he pipped, shuddering at the mental image of getting just SLAMMED by that buckle at top speeds... <i>...b-but...it DIDN'T!  Sooooo...thank you!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Kiba playfully ruffled the top of his pups' fuzzy white head, causing his tail to wag vigorously, earning a laugh from Hunter, Naruto and Kurama.  Sighing a bit from relief and a larger bit from satisfaction, Hunter patted his belly happily and said, \"Well, now that we've ALL got room to tear into these goodies, whadduya say we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped mid-sentence, face reddening immensely again as he stared distantly towards the entrance of the kitchen.  Confused, Naruto and the others turned, then; like Hunter, immediately went silent as they saw Anju standing by the entrance, carrying a couple more pitchers of her homemade cola...staring at the buckle lodged into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeaaaaah...about that...aaaaand the mess-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to Hunter's surprise as well as the surprise of the others, Anju simply smiled a good natured smile as she approached the table and placed the pitchers down for the others, while taking the empty ones away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about all that.  Mr. Groot can have that fixed in no time at all.  He's actually quite handy around here!  Besides...\" she added, smiling down at the gang and ruffling the heads of little Kurama and Akamaru, earning a giggle from the kit and a happy tail wagging from the pup, \"...it's very seldom we get such happy faces here!  Usually, people come in tired, cranky, or...constantly counting to ten on a moment to moment basis...or break our vases for one reason or another...but see you all enjoying yourselves here, reminds me why I love working here so much!  So please, go nuts, and have fun!  And of course, if you need anything else, don't hesitate to let me know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the red headed woman nodded and took her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee, she's such a nice lady...\" Kurama said, smiling fondly as Kiba snickered and added, \"Ya SURE ya don't have a thing for her, fuzzy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Kurama's face reddened redder than a tomato as he sputtered.  \"W-what?!  N-no!  I-I-I just said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Naruto wrapped his arm around Kurama's shoulder and rocked him playfully.  \"Hehe, don't worry about it, buddy.  He's just playing with'cha.  Besides, you're right!  She's a swell lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining composure, Kurama smiled tentatively but genuinely eventually.  Hunter just laughed and said, \"That she is, boys, that she is...SO...without further adieu...let's eat...again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too eager to comply, the four youths grinned and immediately dove right back in for more, shifting between various treats, guzzling down more cola or just savoring the flavor of every delectable treat on the table.  All the while, their bellies continued to swell and swell and swell and swell...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Groaning lightly as he licked some powdered sugar from his muzzle, Hunter slumped back in his seat, arms hanging at his sides. \"Oh man...I don't think I've ever eaten so many sweets at a time in my life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba burped queasily, though he nonetheless had a rather content smile on his face. \"Yeah, same here...\" He rubbed his engorged belly with both hands, licking his lips. \"...but everything's so damn good, I don't care....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, lying on his back, nonetheless agged his tail a bit. <i>I feel like I'm gonna burst....but everything's so yummy, I don't wanna stop....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama let out a little burp, giggling groggily. \"Me neither...these are summa the yummiest things I've ever eaten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked, wrapping an arm about Kurama's shoulders as the other one happily smacked his belly. \"Heh, you're tellin' me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five had continued digging into Rocket's delicious baked goods, savoring the tastes and textures even as their bellies had continued to swell up. They had begun to feel the first stirrings of fullness as they'd downed the cakes, pies, cookies, muffins, and assorted other goodies, but they were simply too delicious to let go. And so they had eaten and eaten, and their tummies had gotten bigger and bigger. By the time they'd finally decided to take this current rest, they'd barely polished off half of the baked goods, and once their stomachs had settled, they were fully intent on finishing off the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, their stomachs had grown to even more obscene proportions, forcing their respective shirts even higher above their belly buttons, to the point where they were practically resting on top of their engorged bellies. Hunter and Kurama's pants had ripped even further, exposing more of their undergarments (when Kurama had realized this while they were eating, he had blushed a bit, but had reached through the opening in his pants and felt the fabric of his boxer-briefs, giggling at how much more was showing than before). Naruto and Kiba's pants, on the other hand, were still intact, but their flies were completely open, exposing their undergarments (blue, ramen-patterned boxers for Naruto, and red, fang-marked briefs for Kiba) for all to see. And, though none of them could particularly see it, the seams of the sides of their shirts were starting to look a bit taxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFace lighting up, Kurama placed his hand-paws on either side of his belly, giving it a little shake. \"Heehee...lookit how big my tummy is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Naruto reached over and poked the young fox's belly playfully. \"Heh, not bad...\" Yawning a bit, he leaned back in his seat and patted his own stomach. \"But look at mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned as he took a look at Naruto's belly. \"Wooooowwww...yours is really big too, Naruto!\" Unable to help himself, he poked Naruto's gut, eliciting a giggle from both youths, even as they both leaned further into each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scowled playfully. \"What're we, chopped liver?\" the dog-nin groused, massaging his own belly with one hand and massaging Akamaru's near-bowling-ball sized tummy with the other (causing the pup to wag his tail and burp.) Hunter merely chuckled at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the sheer amount of food in their bellies, they soon stopped talking and eventually lapsed into a companionable silence. Hunter, wagging his tail, leaned his head back and shut his eyes. Sleep beckoned, but he willed himself to stay awake; after all, Rocket's goodies were too delicious, and he wanted to down as many of them as he possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, this is the life, eh, Kiba?\" Hunter muttered, licking his chops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, leaning back with his eyes shut as well, grinned. \"Heh, you're tellin' me; no chores, no missions, playing and eating all day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru kicked his legs a bit. <i>Yep; it's the life, alright...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuffling Kiba's hair, Hunter smirked. \"Heh, ain't that the truth.\" Eyes still closed, he spoke up again. \"Naruto, Kurama, what about you guys? Is this great or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, nothing answered him. A bit confused, he sat up in his chair, blinking his eyes open. \"Guys?\" Still focusing his eyes, he looked over at where the two were sitting. \"Did you guys...\" He ground to a  halt as he saw the sight that greeted him...and a warm smile spread across his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kurama's eyes were shut as well, but rather unlike Hunter, Kiba, and Akamaru, they didn't appear to merely be resting  their eyes. Indeed, the two youths were leaning against one another, one of Naruto's arms flung about Kurama's shoulders, and their breaths were slow, deep, and steady. Naruto's muzzle was slightly open, a tiny bit of drool visible at the side of his mouth. Naruto, on the other hand, was placidly sucking his thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's warm expression intensified, even as he felt his heart beginning to take on the consistency of mashed potatoes. <i>Awww....little guys are all tuckered out...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze lingered on Kurama for a few long seconds, taking in his peaceful expression, the tiny bit of drool that somehow made him even MORE adorable, the way his ears twitched occasionally...<i>It should be a crime to be that cute.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, his gaze shifted over to Naruto. The little blonde boy was holding Kurama tight, smiling even as he sucked on his thumb.Privately, Hunter was struck by just how <i>innocent</i> he looked like that. <i>Awww...he's awful cute, too...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, his smile became a scowl. <i>I don't care if he had a monster inside of him; how could ANYONE see THAT as anything other than a normal little kid who just wanted friends and family?</i> Now, Hunter was very much a 'people' person...or wolf...who tried to see the best in others, human or otherwise...but the things that people did out of fear and irrational hatred sometimes tended to REALLY piss him off, especially when the recipients of said hatred and fear had done NOTHING to deserve it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's eyes popped open, and he looked up at Hunter, eyes widening. \"Hunter, are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...are you <b>growling</b>?</i> Akamaru finished, blinking his eyes open and looking at the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Hunter's eyes were narrowed, and his lips were peeled back a bit to expose his sharp teeth. Sure enough, a low, throaty growl was emitting from the anthropomorphic canine's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorriedly, Kibareached over and Tugged on Hunter's shirt. \"Uh...Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally noticing Kiba, Hunter glanced over at Kiba's concerned, confused face...and his eyes widened as he realized what he'd been doing. Letting his lips fall back over his teeth, Hunter gave Kiba his best apologetic smile. \"S-sorry about that, Kiba,\" he apologized, wincing. \"I just, uh, thought of something pretty unpleasant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru yipped lightly. <i>Musta been something pretty damn unpleasant to make you growl...</i> Kiba nodded in agreement; in the admittedly brief time they'd known the wolf, they had never seen him lose his temper, or even get angry in any way, save for his brief stormy mood when they'd been trying to decide what to do about Kurama...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged. \"Eh, no point dwelling on it now.\" His eyes went back to the dozing Naruto and Kurama, and his smile returned. \"'Specially not when we're all having such a good time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Akamaru followed his eyes, smirking when they saw Naruto and Kurama dozing away. \"Heh...idiot looks hilarious like that...\" Kiba muttered, snicerking at the sight of Naruto sucking his thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, rolling upright, wagged his tail. <i>No denying that. Still, ya hafta admit they look awfully peaceful...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded in agreement. \"Yeah; almost seems a shame to wake them...\" His eyes roved over all the goodies still left. \"...but then they'd miss out on the all these goodies...\" His eyes went to the ceiling. \"Hmm... what to do...?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then get all competitive and huffy'n annoying and all that crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so?\" asked Hunter, a bit disappointed that he had to disturb such a remarkably adorable and peaceful sight.  However, Kiba nodded firmly and added, \"I KNOW so.\"  And so, with a shrug, Hunter was about to reach over and gently rock the two youths back into consciousness.  When suddenly, the young kit being held tight by Naruto yawned a hearty and adorable sounding yawn in his sleep, before smacking his chops subconsciously, and snuggling right alongside Naruto, as he reached over and grabbed a few tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Immediately, Hunter's eyes widened as Kurama's mouth opened nice and wide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, please don't do what I think you're gonna-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuuuure enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the anthro could even finish his plead, the young Tailed Beast inserted the tips of those tails into his mouth and gently clamped his mouth shut, as though sucking on a pacifier...a few fuzzy ones...but pacifiers nonetheless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, both Akamaru's and even Kiba's eyes widened at the sight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this state, Kurama wasn't THAT much younger than Kiba and Naruto, but even still, given the young kit's nature, appearance and current state, Kiba couldn't help but gape at how positively adorable the young creature looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Holy crap...\" muttered the young dog nin.  Akamaru simply nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...And I thought puppies in cups were supposed to be the cutest things in the world...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Hunter...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Kiba and Akamaru glanced over, seeing the wolf's bottom lip trembling as his eyes widened almost comically at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Errrrr....y-you okay, wolfy?\" asked Kiba, cautiously nudging the anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....S-so...cute...\" was all Hunter could mutter, desperately not wanting to spoil the moment.  Then, an idea occurred...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oiy!  Where're you goin'?\" asked Kiba as Hunter got up from the table and stepped out of sight for a moment, much to the young dog-nin and nin-dog's confusion as the two glanced at one another, befuddled.  This confusion was short lived however, when Hunter returned once again with his strange device...a 'cell-phone' as he called it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If ever there were a more picture perfect moment...I think my head would literally 'a splode'...\" muttered Hunter to himself as he adjusted the focus on his cell's camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Uhhh...'a splode'?</i> chimed Akamaru, tilting his head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Hunter stopped and chuckled, rubbing the back of his head sheepishly.  \"Oh, sorry, that's from this really old web series, it was called-oh...riiiiight, h-heh, sorry, ummm...it's a joke.  Like, my head would explode from how positively freakin' adorable these two look right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were totally lost.  Nonetheless, Hunter just smirked and once the frame turned green, took a picture perfect photo of the two; Naruto sucking on his thumb and tugging a young fox kit close, and the kit, nuzzled against his buddy and sucking on his tails.  Hunter stepped back and shared the image with Kiba and Akamaru, and; despite the teasing and confusing terminology, there was no denying how heart warming the sight truly was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Damn...\" muttered Kiba, unable to suppress a warm smile, \"...they really <i>do</i> look like...like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Like brothers...</i> finished Akamaru, tail wagging as he glanced at the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter said nothing.  He merely smiled warmly at the picture, placing the camera in his pocket, and glanced back at the two resting youths.  For a moment, however, he lowered his gaze and looked aside, somewhat distantly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...If only their friendship could stay as long lasting as the photo...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed softly to himself, internally cursed the fact that, sooner or later, this beautiful, heartwarming bond these two youngsters had formed in so short a time, would dissolve...but nonetheless, he shook the thought aside.  Afterall, there was nothing that could be done to prevent the inevitable, so rather, Hunter; not wanting to spoil the fun, instead...opted to just hope everyone could make the most out of the present, especially Naruto and Kurama...and as the smirk returned back to his muzzle, he reached over, and gently rocked Naruto and; by proxy, Kurama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeeey, little guys...\" Hunter spoke softly, as Naruto squinted and eventually began to rub his eyes with his forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mph...how long was I out?\" muttered Naruto groggily.  But before Hunter could answer, Naruto's eyes widened as he added, \"Wait, you guys didn't eat without me, did'ja?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba held his hands out towards Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" he said, earning a snicker from Hunter while Kiba chuckled and said, \"No, bonehead, we didn't eat without'chu guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good!  Cause I ain't done by-wait, us guys...?\"  Then, Naruto noticed he felt something warm snugged against him.  Sure enough, he glanced down, and immediately, his face lightened up at the sight of a snoozing Kurama sucking on his tails and nuzzling the young blonde warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, bonehead, y'er his pillow,\" remarked Kiba teasingly, though it was obviously good natured.  Naruto paid no heed.  Rather, he reached over and very lightly ruffled the young kit's fuzzy little head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, riiiiise'n shine, buddy,\" said Naruto softly to the young fox, who; like Naruto, squinted and slowly opened his eyes.  \"H-hmm?\" was all the young kit could say, before realizing his mouth was full of tails.  Eyes widening, he immediately spat them out and sat up, blushing beneath his fur as he grinned sheepishly.  \"O-Oh!  H-hey, guys!  H-heh....I err....t-think I may'uh dozed off for a second there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Naruto just chuckled and playfully ruffled the kits' head, earning a soft giggle from the young creature.  \"Hehe, you'n me both, so don't sweat it, buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with a bit of relief that no one was laughing at him, Kurama eventually beamed then glanced back at the others.  \"Boy, this stuff really IS super yummy, huh, guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Hunter nodded and patted his own bloated belly as he said, \"And then some, kiddo!\"  And with a somewhat impish grin, Hunter turned to the four youths sitting around him and said, \"So whadduya say we show Rocket just how much we appreciate that stellar baking talent'uh his?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the only way I can think'uh doin' that is if we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stopped mid-sentence.  Immediately, the four all turned to one another, grins slowly forming over all their mugs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Hunter smirked and nodded.  \"Yep...if we finished every...last...bite...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, astonished, rested both his paws on his bulbous tummy and giggled at its' sloshing about.  \"...I don't my tummy has ever even BEEN that full before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto playfully nudged his new friend and said, \"First time for everything, buddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned.  \"Took the words right outta my mouth, bonehead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, for his part, whined a bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm gonna be the biggest bowling ball ever...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Then, his tail started wagging...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Ah.  Worth it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in no time at all, all five were immediately tearing right back into their assorted sweets and beverages with vigor and a yearning to sink their teeth into as many of the goodies as they could possibly fit into their all-too-eager maws...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as time went on...</span></div></div>",

They shoveled cookies, slices of pie, slabs of cake, muffins, and more into their eager maws. Akamaru, on the other hand, eagerly dug his head into whichever sweets were closest, wagging his tail rapidly at just how tasty everything was. Every now and then, one of them would stop to take a swig of soda (or a milkshake float), pat their belly, belch to free up some room, and then dive right back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how absolutely overstuffed their bellies already were, it didn't take long for them to start swelling again. Naruto, Kiba, Kurama, and Hunter's bellies pushed out further and further in front of them, to the point where they had to start scooting back a little bit so as not to press against the table. In addition, the sheer size of their bellies began forcing their legs apart. Their shirts slowly slid further upwards, eventually coming to rest fully on top of the engorged spheres their bellies had become (something Kurama noted with a grin and a giggle), and the seams of the sides of their shirts became more noticeably taxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, Hunter and Kurama's already ripped pants tore open further, exposing more and more of their undergarments and, eventually, even a tiny bit of their furry legs. Naruto and Kiba's flies were already fully opened, but the fronts of their pants had begun creaking ominously, the intensity of which only increased as they shoveled more food and drink into their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, his belly having already swollen to near-bowling-ball proportions, tilted forward, steadying himself with his paws on whatever was closest even as he gulped down mouthful after mouthful of the delicious sweets. Inwardly, he winced as he felt his belly bulging bigger and bigger, gradually lifting him further up off the table, his legs being forced even further apart...but he pressed on, not caring in the slightest. After all, it wasn't too often he got too eat treats THIS good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they continued to eat and drink; the ripped clothes ripped more, Naruto and Kiba's opened pants creaked more and more, and the seams of everyone's shirts continued to strain. All the while, the goodies began decreasing noticeably in quantity, though there was still a far more than considerable amount to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidway through a rather large blueberry pie, Akamaru's eyes widened. <i>Huh?</i> Even as he leaned forward further on his belly and wolfed down the dessert, he furrowed his brow. <i>My stomach's feeling kinda funny...</i> Privately, he wondered if he should let Kiba know, but put the thought aside. It was a peculiar sensation, one that slowly grew as he ate, but it wasn't a particularly unpleasant one. <i>Eh, gut's probably just adjusting to how much I'm eating; I don't think I've ever gone THIS far before.</i> Satisfied with this explanation (though there was a nagging thought that he SHOULD know more about the strange feeling), he quickly resumed gulping down the pie, using his front paws to steady himself on the tin (since there was no way in hell any of his paws would even touch the table at this point).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, all five of them continued to eat and drink, their bellies grew ever larger, and their already taxed clothing creaked ever more noticeably. All the while, the strange sensation in Akamaru's tummy grew and intensified...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they dug in and continued to stuff their faces, with no sign of slowing down anytime soon...</span></div></div>",

In the process, however, they had all begun to notably flag in their feasting endeavors.  They would now find themselves eating at a much slower pace, taking more breaks to stop and rub their bellies in an effort to coax the strain away, or take more swigs of their drinks and belch more often in an effort to free up what little room was remaining in their respective tummies.  And yet, despite all that, the table was nothing but smiles as they soldiered on and on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as Akamaru felt that incredibly peculiar sensation in his steadily swelling belly; a sensation not yet felt before, he just chomped away at his pies and whatever else was in front of him.  The sheer taste of the goodies Rocket had been kind enough to bake for them was simply too good to stop eating, even for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Naruto and Kiba fared about the same.  The creaking in the front of their pants seemed to intensify more and more, but neither one let up.  Rather, the two; like everyone else, ate and ate and ate some more; pants creaking steadily and the seams of their shirts  growing ever more and more strained the larger their bellies got.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Naruto stopped for a moment, let out a particularly huge belch; which earned a giggle from Kurama, and leaned back in his already scooted chair to rub his stupendously bloated belly for a moment.  Seeing this, Kiba smirked and said, \"Aww, after we waited so you guys could join in on the fun?  Don't tell me y'er givin' up NOW, bonehead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scoffed and said, \"Pffft, dream on, dog-breath!  Just needed a quick breather for a second or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh, whatever you say...hey, ain't no shame in admittin' y'er full.  Just means more for us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Naruto raised an eyebrow.  \"Full?  Alright, dog-face, I'll show ya just how full I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a confident grin, he reached over to his nearest pie, cut out a slice, and almost immediately; rather than grabbing a fork and knife like he'd been doing, began greedily chomping the slice down straight from his hand.  Licking the blueberry fruit sauce from his lips, Naruto grinned, grabbed a muffin, and began just stuffing as much of it as he possibly could into his mouth, before taking a HUGE bite, and chomping down voraciously, all the while grinning that same, confident grin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter ate, he watched the blonde boy go on and on, and couldn't help but smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hehe, who else but Kiba knows how to get this kid going this fiercely...</i> Hunter thought, chuckling a bit as he watched Naruto press on.  <i>Just hope Naruto doesn't get a stomachache...or accidentally bite his own fingers...or choke...</i>  Hunter's smirk faded a bit as he realized just how much and how fast the boy was putting away, then raised a paw hesitantly.  \"Y'know, m-maybe you've proved your point, kiddo.  No harm in slowin' down a bit and savorin' the goodies, right?\"  But; Naruto being Naruto, just kept going while the others watched in rapt attention...until suddenly, the sound of a slight tear, caught everyone's attention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RRRIIIIIIIIP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seams to Naruto's shirt just tore wide open from side to side, causing the shirt already resting over the boys' globular orb of a belly, to become much less constricting as the sides gave way...allowing Naruto's belly to expand freely a noticeable amount, which caused the creak already in his pants to become a slight tear as well.  Almost immediately, Naruto sighed a tremendous sigh of relief and slouched on his chair, both hands rested atop his immensely swollen belly as he smiled a goofy smile and said, \"Ohhhhh yeah, MUCH better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting his belly happily with both hands, he glanced back at Kiba and said, \"Soooooo, what was that you were sayin' about being too full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba rolled his eyes and resumed his own meal with a scoff.  \"Point taken, bonehead...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, Hunter sighed with relief, then, chuckled softly.  \"Hehe, well...that's new...\" he admitted, while Kurama giggled, pointing at Naruto's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee, if ya keep that up, your shirt's start lookin' like a bib!\" the kit exclaimed with a giggle, before getting a closer look at his pal's rounded stomach.  His giggle then turned into a gape of astonishment.  \"Woooow, lookit how much bigger your tummy got in such a teeny tiny while!\" the young fox remarked, playfully poking Naruto's huge gut for emphasis, while Naruto smirked and patted his belly proudly, earning yet another giggle from the young Tailed Beast as he watched Naruto's stomach bounce and slosh visibly with each pat.  Then, the smile left Naruto's face as his eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching that, Kurama glanced at Naruto with moderate concern.  \"N-Naruto?  A-are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto didn't respond, Hunter glanced with worry.  <i>Oh crap, I knew he'd get a stomachache if he kept that up...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whimpered a bit when a look of strain and discomfort took the boys' face while Kiba was internally kicking himself for goating Naruto on.  But before he could open his mouth, Naruto opened his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPP !!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And out expelled a lengthy and titanic belch, which rattled the table and echoed throughout the entire kitchen.  The gang simply gaped for a moment as the burp went on and on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Until finally, the burp wound down, and a look of stupendous bliss overtook Naruto's face, as; once again, he slouched in his chair and let one arm dangle from the side of his chair, while the other rested atop his ample tummy.  \"Ohhh man, that felt good...\" muttered the boy, patting his belly with pride, while others continued to gape...until suddenly, the expressions of awe turned into smirks, and eventually, a fit of laughter all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, am I glad Rocket ain't here to see...or hear that...\"  said Hunter, chuckling as he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, how 'bout a lil freakin' warning next time, bonehead!' muttered Kiba while Akamaru barked in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others chuckled, but Kurama was laughing uproariously.  \"Heehaha!  Naruto...that was like the biggest, bestest burp ever!  I mean, I was worried maybe you got a tummy-ache or felt sick, but then, everything's just like KABOOM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto watched the kit go on, he couldn't help but chuckle himself at the young creatures just natural excitement and happy expression.  Nonetheless, he managed a smirk and wrapped his arm around the kits' shoulders as he tugged him playfully and said, \"What can I say?  I aim tuh please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the sound of footsteps caught everyone's ears as; in unison, they all turned around to the outside, and saw Anju walking towards the entrance and opening the front door as she looked up at the sky, much to everyone's confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing nothing, she scratched her redhead in confusion and stepped back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, everything okay, Ms. Anju?\" asked Kurama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the darnedest thing...\" Anju replied, still looking befuddled, \"...I could've sworn I heard the Four Giants returning to Termina...thought maybe another evil moon came back...\"  Then, with a surprising shrug, the smile returned to her face, and she went right back upstairs, leaving the gang positively stunned for a moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Before all five burst into a fit of laughter for a good merry while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhahahhh man...\" remarked Hunter as the laughter eventually died down, safe for a few chuckles.  \"Well then, I dunno bout'chu boys, boy I still have a sweet tooth to satisfy...\"  And with grins all around, the gang once again resumed tearing into their meal.  Naruto notably picked up the pace just a bit, having freed up a bit of room with his prior antics, while Kiba; not one to be outdone by his blonde buddy, picked up the pace as well.  Both Hunter and Kurama continued eating at the same laxed pace they'd been eating at thus far, and Akamaru could still feel that peculiar sensation in his rapidly growing belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Sure enough, as more and more time passed, and as more and more baked goods began to vanish in the bellies of everyone at the table...</span></div></div>",

It still wasn't painful, but it was beginning to make his stomach feel rather tight....and, if he was being honest, it was starting to feel a little uncomfortable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winced. <i>Ooh...that's gonna be smarting in a little bit, isn't it...</i> Finally coming to a decision, he looked up at Kiba and opened his muzzle to bark and alert Kiba as to his predicament...but stopped upon catching his expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog-nin was cramming all sorts of goodies into his mouth-cookies, muffins, you name it-and chewing them rapidly with a bright smile upon his face. As Akamaru looked around, he saw Hunter, Naruto, and Kurama with much the same blissful expressions on their faces, faces all smiles as they crammed as many of Rocket's delicious baked goods as they could squeeze into their mouths at a time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWagging his tail a bit, Akamaru lowered his head, continuing to wolf down his pies. <i>Ah, they're all having such a great time; no need to bother them.</i> He felt a surge of pride in his chest. <i>Besides, what kinda ninja dog would I be if I couldn't suck up a little bit of discomfort?</i> He licked his chops, getting some cherry residue off his muzzle. <i>Besides, no way am I leaving these pies out any longer than they need to be!</i> With that, he dove back in with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime continued to pass: Naruto, Kiba, Kurama, and Hunter continued shoveling as many sweets into their waiting maws as they could, and Akamaru stuck his head ever deeper into his pies. All the while, their tummies bulged bigger and bigger; Naruto's belly pushed out further and further, thankfully not taxing his ripped shirt any further. Kiba's shirt, on the other hand, seemed to be getting noticeably taxed, as did Kurama's shirt. Hunter, though his belly continued to swell thanks to his busted, ripped trousers, did not seem to be taxing his shirt anywhere near as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Akamaru?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup winced, even as he took a bite of apple pie. <i>Oooh, yeah, that's definitely starting to smart.</i> Indeed, his stomach had ballooned up a bit more, lifting him up higher off the table...but even more tellingly, the strange sensation in his tummy intensified even further. At this point, it had gotten extremely tight, and the pup almost felt like he was going to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ooh...</i> the pup whined. <i>Maybe I ate a little too much...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze went back to the pies on the table, practically tempting him with their delectable aromas. <i>...on second thought, maybe one last bite won't hurt.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought in mind, he maneuvered his way back over to the apple pie, opened his mouth wide (after all, stuffed or not, he still wanted to eat as much of the delectable deserts as he possibly could), took a huge bite of the pie, gulped it down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>POP.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and yelped in alarm as the pressure in his belly briefly elevated to the point where he thought he WOULD explode before it suddenly whooshed out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, midway through gulping down a shake, noticed this, and his eyes flew to his canine buddy. \"Akamaru? Are you OK?!\" At this exclamation, the others glanced up from their treats, staring at the pup in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Kiba's relief, the pup let out a little burp, wagging his tail. <i>Y-yeah, I'm fine. In fact...</i> The dog's eyes lit up. <i>I was feeling really full a minute ago, but now I feel like I can eat way more!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama tilted his head curiously. \"Really?\" The kit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru nodded eagerly. <i>Yeah! I mean, I kept on eating, and pressure kept on building in my tummy, but as soon as I took that last bite...WHOOSH! All gone!</i> Sticking his tongue out the side of his muzzle and wagging his tail, Akamaru flopped onto his back, almost looking a bit delirious. <i>Heehee, it felt funny, though, lemme tell ya...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen no one responded, Akamaru opened his eyes and lifted his head up to see the others gaping, wide-eyed, at him. <i>What? What're you all staring at? Not like I haven't ended up looking like a bowling ball before, 'specially since I'm probably gonna get a LOT bigger...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them said anything...but Kiba, still wide eyed, pointed to the top of Akamaru's bulbous white tummy. <i>Huh? What's wrong, Kiba?</i> Akamaru lifted his head up as far as it would go, attempting to peer at the top of his belly. <i>What are you...pointing...at...</i> The pup trailed off, his muzzle dropping open as he saw what his partner was pointing at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, right in the center of his swollen white belly, a small, white-furred nub stuck out for all to see, wobbling with the tiniest movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru continued to gape, shaking his head a few times to verify that yes, the nub was exactly what it thought he was. Once he'd confirmed this, he gave only one, low, deadpan bark:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both Naruto and Kurama nodded in agreement, also gaping...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, for all the times we've stuffed our craws, I never once saw you pop out your belly button like that, boy...\" remarked Kiba, a mixture of surprise and pride in his voice.  The pup, on the other hand, was flushing redder than seven dozen roses.  Catching this, Kiba smirked and asked, \"Oiy, what's the matter, Akamaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill whining in embarrassment, Akamaru finally answered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Y-you're right...I don't think I've ever...EVER eaten this much before...I used to always think that, yeah, I might overdo it, but when push came to shove, I still knew moderation...and hopefully, I'd, well, I'd be able to remind you of that on the occasions you guys REALLY overdo it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup then glanced down at his wobbling stub of a navel and whimpered some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But now?  Ah, jeez...b-bet I look really silly too, don't I...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to his surprise, Kiba burst into a fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet ya do!  And guess what?  So do I.  So does Wolfy.  So does fuzzball...and most of all, so does the ultimate bonehead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and the others glanced at Kiba for a moment, but eventually lightened their expressions and turned their attention back at the still red-in-the-face pup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hate to say it, but dog-breath is right on the money.  I mean, think about it, half the times we hang out, we stuff ourselves so packed full'uh food, we look like we're about to give birth to overweight boulders,\" said Naruto.  Kurama bobbed his head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuh-huh!  And lookit the rest of us!\"  Kurama said as he grabbed his rounded tummy and sloshed it around with both paws, giggling at the sensation as he did so.  \"We're all eating our fill, and before ya know it, we'll all pop out our belly buttons too!  So there's no shame in popping yours for the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked and nodded back.  \"Besides, you forget whose cookin' y'er wolfin' down there, lil fella?  Hell, I'd be surprised if Rocket's baking DIDN'T make ya pop out your belly button like that.  And he'd probably be offended...y'know...if the sight of it wouldn't make him pass out from disgust...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru processed that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Y-yeah, that's true...that little ball of anger DOES know his way around the kitchen...a-and yeah, I guess I shouldn't be too embarrassed.  I mean, you guys pop your navels all the time...but I always thought; like, no matter how bowling ball-esque I got, I still had SOME self control when it came to food...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kiba just chuckled and ruffled the pups' head playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, it don't matter if ya overdid it more than usual this time.  Trust me, it really doesn't.  I ain't gonna think any less of ya, and I damn sure won't respect ya less for 'not having discipline,' ya lil volley ball.  And do ya know why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked warmly and hoisted the pup up.  \"Cause y'er my pal.  My goofy, best pal...and when we're hangin' out, you don't gotta EVER worry bout me, or any'uh these guys judgin' ya or anything like that, ya got me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Akamaru felt a great warmth in his little puppy chest as he barked happily at Kiba and playfully licked the young dog-nin across the cheek, earning a chuckle from the boy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, ahhh alright, don't get all mushy on me, ya lil...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kiba stopped as he glanced down at Akamaru's navel.  Suddenly, Akamaru's expression became one of confusion as an impish grin grew over the boys' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saaaaay, Akamaru...since this is the first time ya ever popped y'er belly button like this...I don't suppose you know how THIS feels, do ya...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just before Akamaru could inquire what 'THIS' meant, Kiba immediately took a finger and began flickering the inverted stump protruding from the pup's bloated tummy.  And immediately, the little pup began snickering and wiggling playfully in Kiba's hands as he resisted to no avail against the onslaught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>HeehehehahahahaHAHAHAHA!!!  N-No FAAAAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAAAAAA!!!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, Kurama and Hunter all snickered relentlessly as Kiba continued his onslaught for a good while, until finally, he chuckled and set the pup back down before his set of pies, still panting from the tickling and wagging his tail merrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hehehe, gee that really DOES feel funny...!  No wonder you guys are always havin' such a good time whenever ya do that!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned to Kurama and beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And you weren't kidding!  The amount of relief you feel after y'er tummy feels so tight feels SOOOO good!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama simply giggled and nodded in agreement.  \"Heehee, told'ja!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, an impish grin grew over the pup's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And best of all?  I feel like I can eat WAAAAAY more...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup then licked his chops...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>....And, ehehehe....I intend to...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd immediately, the pup dove right into his pies, with the others grinning and promptly joining in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as time went on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite their considerably slower pace, none of them let up as they continued digging into their goodies; Akamaru taking bite after massive bite of his pies, and the others cramming goodies into their waiting mouths. They didn't discriminate between what they shoved in; after all, it was all so tasty they really didn't care what they were eating. And, predictably, their stomachs continued to swell, slowly but ever so surely. Kiba's pants, still un-ripped, were nonetheless being taxed to their breaking point, creaking audibly. Hearing this, the young dog-nin smirked. <i>Heh; won't be long now...</i> Spurred on by the knowledge that Naruto, Kurama, and Hunter had all already ripped theirs to varying extents, he powered on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kurama,for their part,were having a blast; whether it was cramming cookies and muffins into their waiting maws or taking huge swigs of their milkshake floats, they both appeared to be having the time of their lives. At least, that's what Hunter guessed by the huge grin on Naruto's face and the merry kicking of Kurama's legs....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, both their eyes widened, and they immediately stopped mid-bite. Hunter, noticing this, wiped his muzzle with a sleeve and looked towards them. \"Um....you two feeling OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the question, Kurama beamed, swallowing before answering. \"Oh yeah, I'm feeling great!\" Naruto, in the middle of swallowing a particularly large mouthful, only nodded his agreement. \"It's just....\" A playful little smirk lit up his muzzle. \"The middle of my tummy is feeling... kinda tight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, taking a deep breath, smirked along with him. \"Yeah...\" he added, patting his tummy and causing it to jostle a bit. \"Mine too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, though feeling a brief spike of jealousy (he hadn't begun feeling that familiar tightness just yet), smirked in return. \"Heh, figures you two would start feelin' that at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, no surprise there,</i> Akamaru added, lifting his head up from his pies (and revealing it to be splattered a variety of colors).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled, rubbing the back of his head. \"Heh, it IS kinda funny, isn't it?\" Turning to Naruto, he asked, \"So, Naruto...how do ya wanna pop 'em? You wanna just keep eatin' more of these yummy goodies, or do ya wanna try the milkshake floats?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Naruto folded his arms and closed his eyes, apparently deep in thought. After a few seconds, he opened them and smirked playfully at his young fox friend. \"Weelll, I wanna get back to eating as soon as possible without feelin' sick, so...\" his eyes fell on their beverages. \"...whaddaya say we chug these till we pop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama beamed. \"Sounds great! 'Sides,\" he added, rubbing his globular tummy and letting out a happy little belch, \"if we do it like that, it'll be easier for us to keep goin' and not hafta take a break and feel the tightness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winked. \"That's kinda what I was thinkin'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, both of them picked their floats up in both hands/paws, grinned at each other, and lifted their pitchers to their mouths, opening wide to let the cool treat/beverage in. A noticeable amount spilled down the sides of their faces as they chugged, but they paid it no mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked  at just how fast they were going. <i>Heh; those two must REALLY wanna pop their navels, huh?</i> He patted his own globular tummy. <i>Not that I blame 'em; it feels AMAZING....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, surprisingly, found himself transfixed by the sight....and just how quickly their stomachs were swelling up as their milkshake floats entered their gullets. A part of him urged him to chug his own and attempt to beat them to the punch, but the rest of him was too engrossed in what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, as Naruto and Kurama chugged away, their bellies continued to swell, pushing out further from them and forcing their legs further apart. The slight rip in Naruto's pants, subsequently, grew wider and wider, exposing more of his undergarments, and the seams of Kurama's shirt began to become visibly taxed, even as the young Nine-Tails' pants ripped even further. All the while, the tightness in the middle of their bellies steadily intensified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama winced. <i>Ooohh...my tummy's startin' to become tight...</i> He grimaced as he remembered just how unpleasant it had been the other day, when they'd been eating their sundae and he'd felt like he was going to burst. <i>It's really gonna start hurting, isn't it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought this, he glanced at Naruto, who was still eagerly chugging away. His stomach steadily swelled, a steady ripping noise revealing that, yes, his pants were continuing to rip. Catching Kurama's look, his eyes flitted over to his friend. Though he could not say anything at the moment, he nonetheless flashed Kurama a grin, before returning his attention to his chugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned determinedly. <i>B-but it's all gonna be worth it, and besides, Naruto has faith in me!</i> He giggled a bit, tilting his pitcher backf urther. <i>And I'm not gonna let him down!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two renewed their pace, pouring more of their milkshake floats down their waiting gullets and into their ever-expanding bellies, which pushed further and further outward. Naruto's pants ripped even further, and Kurama could have sworn he felt a slight release of pressure on the sides of his shirt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Kiba gaped, confirming that, yes, Kurama HAD just busted a couple of his shirt seams. It wasn't near as many as Naruto, but it was enough to spur Kurama on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more they chugged, and the bigger and bigger their tummies swelled. All the while, the middle of their bellies grew tighter and tighter. Kurama whimpered a bit as it began to grow painful, but he soldiered on, determined not to let up now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHewasn't the only one. Naruto, too, wincedas he felt his stomach growing tighter and tighter. <i>Oh man...it feels like I'm gonna explode!</i> He glanced at Kurama for a moment, then narrowed his eyes. <i>N-no way! I'm not giving up now, not when Kurama's trying his damnedest!</i> With that thought in mind, he returned to his float with full vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto and Kurama chugged, they felt the middle of their bellies grow tighter and tighter. They both let out little involuntary whimpers at the pain (causing Hunter to wince and raise a paw to urge them to take a break, but thought better of it), but never did they let up. All the while, the middle of their bellies grew tighter, tighter, tighter, and, when it felt as though their stomachs were going to explode, they tilted their floats further up to take one last, giant gulp...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>POP!</b></i><br>\r\n<i><b>POP!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pair of surprisingly loud, fleshy pops, Naruto and Kurama jolted back as their navels all but <i>surged</i> outwards, becoming large fleshy and furry nubs, respectively, that wobbled from the sheer force of it. As Naruto and Kurama set their greatly-depleted pitchers on the table and slouched back in their seats, Naruto's eyes crossed and Kurama's tongue hanging out the side of his muzzle, only one thought went through Hunter, Kiba, and Akamaru's minds:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dayum.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to the inner musings of their friends, Naruto and Kurama contentedly smacked their chops, the blonde sluggishly patting his belly and causing his navel to wobble slightly. \"Oh MAN,\" he almost moaned, giggling a bit deliriously, \"that...that was the best pop ever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama burped wetly. \"Well...it was only my second time popping my belly button...\" He grinned, sitting upright a bit. \"But it felt even better than yesterday!\" He wiggled his navel, giggling as he did so. \"This feels just as funny as yesterday, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, fiddling with his own navel a bit, glanced toward Kurama, grinning impishly. \"Really?\" he asked, sitting up as well. \"Does it feel funny when I do...this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Kurama stopped playing with his belly button and glanced over at Naruto. \"When you do wha--\" He scarcely had time to finish when Naruto reached over and began fiddling with the young Nine-Tail's fuzzy navel. At this, Kurama burst into giggles. \"N-Naruto! St-stoppit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto beamed even wider and continued wiggling the furry protuberance. \"Heehee, it's all fuzzy!\" He stopped to give it a better look, and whistled. \"Wow, is that a belly-button or a fist...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled uproariously. \"H-heehee, c'mon, it's not tha-ha-ha-ha-t big!\" At this, a a rather mischevious smile crossed his muzzle. \"Least, not as big as...yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this last word left his mouth, he reached over and began playing with Naruto's navel. The boy's blue eyes went wide....before bursting into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, c'mon, Kurama! No fai-haha!\" In retaliation, he wiggled Kurama's navel faster, causing the young creature to giggle even more and begin kicking his legs. In turn, Kurama wiggled Naruto's with greater intensity, causing the boy to laugh and begin kicking <i>his</i> legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're doin' it to me,\" Kurama replied cheekily. \"Only fair I do it to you!\" As the \"you\" left his muzzle, he heaved himself and his swollen belly around in the chair so he was facing Naruto. Grinning, he reached both arms out and began playing with his navel in earnest; poking it, wiggling it about, playfully squishing it, and pushing it back in only for it to pop right back out, much to his amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto roared. \"H-hahahaha! T-two can play at tha-ha-ha-t game!\" He adjusted himself  to face Kurama and began fooling around with his Kurama's navel, which only caused the young Kyubi to giggle even harder and renew his own efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Akamaru could only gape, wide-eyed, at the sight. Hunter, on the other hand, sat there, eye twitching violently...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mein GOTT, that's adorable,</i> the anthro thought, absentmindedly pounding his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hunter was still trying to 'restart' his chest...and speaking a strange sort of foreign language Kiba never heard before, just assuming it was the language of his people or something.  But as the dog-nin watched the two youths go at it, he couldn't help but smile at the merriment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I swear, it's amazing how tight these two've gotten in so short a time...</i>  Kiba thought, chuckling softly as he turned his attention to Kurama, who was giggling merrily and kicking his little legs about.  <i>Guess the fuzzball's bubbly personality helps...he's just so damn happy'n gentle all the time...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile faded for a moment as another thought eventually crept back into his mind, causing the boy to sigh to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...I'm gonna miss him...but...poor bonehead's gonna hafta let this go, and that's just...that's not fair...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Akamaru could catch this, Kiba forced that thought back and chuckled as the two ticklish youths continued to go at it some more before finally, they disentangled from one another and chuckled wearily.  \"Heehee, that felt so funny!\" giggled the kit, much to Naruto's amusement.  \"Gee, really?  I hadn't noticed,\" he added with a chuckle, playfully ruffling Kurama's head, causing the kit to giggle and squirm some more, before turning his seat back to normal and resting both palms against his tummy and sloshing it about, causing him to giggle even more.  \"Best of all, my tummy feels like it can take in WAY more now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just grinned, adjusting his own seat and giving his own belly a hearty slap, causing it to jostle and for his nub to wobble.  \"Good, cause we're gonna need all the room we can get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter finally composed himself and chuckled softly at the youths.  \"W-well, glad you boys had fun, h-heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just snickered.  \"Too MUCH fun!  Another few seconds'n I was gonna hafta jump in there'n break up that tickle showdown...\"  The dog-nin said, causing both Naruto and Kurama to turn towards one another and snicker.  \"Anyway, now that all that's done with...we gonna eat'er what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru needed no second heed before slugging himself towards a cherry pie...STILL somehow steaming with its' delightful aroma wafting into the pup's hypersensitive puppy nose, and immediately dug his head into the top, chowing down merrily.  Kiba just laughed and ruffled the pup's back as he said, \"NOW y'er talkin'!\"  Before long, Kiba grabbed a chocolate mousse pie of his own, and began scarfing it down with gusto, savoring the rich chocolate flavor merrily as his lips smeared with chocolate from such fast paced bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grabbed more slices of cake for himself and for Kurama, then stopped as an idea occurred.  \"Say, Kurama...\" the blonde began, causing the kits' ears to twitch curiously.  \"Hmm?  What's up, Naruto?\"  The young fox asked curiously.  To which, the boy grinned and said, \"you've tried ice cream floats, and just regular ice cream itself, and enjoyed them, right?\"  To which, the young kyuubi beamed and bobbed his head eagerly.  \"Yuh-huh!  It was all SUPER yummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde just grinned and grabbed a few slices of apple pie for Kurama, then scooped some Vanilla ice cream and lathered them atop the pies, causing Kurama's head to tilt curiously.  \"Huh?  What'cha doing, Naruto?\"  To which, Naruto grinned and said, \"I tried this once.  Basically, when ya got cold, frosty ice cream on top of warm, gooey pie, the two kinda...complement each other.  Like the apple sauce and cinnamon absorb into the ice cream'er whatever and...well, taste for yourself and see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama glanced down curiously, but nonetheless grinned eagerly and took a fairly decent sized bite, chewing and savoring the taste for a moment, until his eyes lit up like firecrackers.  \"Oh...oh WOW!\" the kit exclaimed, causing Naruto to grin.  \"Good, right?\"  As if to answer, Kurama immediately began taking more eager bites, face lighting up with each one.  \"Mmmm!  These two by themselves were already super yummy!  But this?  This is...yummy on TOP of yummy!  It's-it's like the two became one super DUPER yummy dessert, that's hot but cold, sweet but frosty and just so good!\"  The kit merrily began digging in some more, kicking his legs eagerly as he did so, causing Naruto to smirk and add, \"Heh, somethin' told me you'd enjoy that,\" before digging into his cakes merrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just chuckled.  \"Y'know, you'd be surprised how complementing tastes can really create a new flavorful experience.  Hot and cold are one thing, but one a lot of people love is sweet and salty.  Like chocolates with caramel and pretzels inside.  It's amazing how gooey yet crunchy are such a winning combo.  Or even chocolates with caramel and bacon inside.  I swear, first time I ate that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro wolf stopped midsentence, as he noticed all four youths staring back at him with blank expressions on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked dully for a moment before asking, \"...Did...did you just say...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...chocolate...and BACON...?\" finished Naruto, face and blank as they went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter scratched his head curiously, and with a shrug, said, \"...Errr...yes...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's ears twitched as his face screwed upward a bit.  \"...I...I like chocolates and bacon plenty...b-but TOGETHER...?\"  The kit clenched his eyes shut and stuck out his tongue at the thought.  \"...That sounds kinda yucky...\"  And judging by the nods from the other youths, the young tailed beast wasn't alone on that sentiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, for his part, just laughed.  \"Look, I get it, I had that EXACT same thought the first time someone offered me a bar, but I'm telling you, you'd be surprised how good it really tastes.  Mine was milk chocolate with maple syrup and bacon inside, and the contrasting flavors just made the whole thing taste...well...INCREDIBLE.  My point is, don't judge something too harshly til you've at least tried it.  Who knows?  You might like it even more than I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru blinked dully.  <i>Okay, this wolf truly IS crazy.  Watch, next, he's gonna say chocolates taste great with GRASSHOPPERS inside!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, Hunter snickered, but opted to simply shrug.  \"Food for thought, boys.  Speaking of which...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost comically, Hunter grabbed a few chocolate and some banana muffins and began greedily chomping down on their tops, savoring the flavors of both soft baked goods just melting in his mouth.  Before long, all chit chat subsided and everyone was chowing down relentlessly.  Naruto, Kurama and even Akamaru were trailblazing with no signs of slowing down due to their popped out navels freeing up whatever tightness remained in their guts.  As time went on, however, both Kiba and Hunter had begun to flag just a little bit.  The two continued soldiering on, and for a while, they both managed just fine.  However, as more time passed, both the anthro wolf and the young dog-nin began to feel a certain tightness in their bellies that kept them from REALLY polishing off their respective treats the right way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto reached up to grab more cookies, doughnuts and cake, he caught wind of Kiba and Hunter slogging through their baked goods and smirked slyly.  \"Hehe, s'wrong, guys?  Y'er not quittin' on us NOW, are ya?  There's still so much left to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba snorted and said, \"Fat chance, bonehead.  It's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...There's still one last thing me'n Kiba here have yet to pop,\" Hunter finished, before turning to Kiba and grinning.  \"Wouldn't wanna be left out, now, would we?\"  At this, Kiba grinned and shook his head.  \"Hehe, nope.  Question is, how're we gonna go about-\"  Kiba trailed off as he glanced nearby and caught sight of some of the pitchers of homemade cola Anju brought along after Hunter busted his belt...literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saaaaaay, Hunter...\" Kiba began, grinning impishly as he continued.  \"Since everyone else kinda just popped their belly buttons suddenly...whadduya say we make ours a lil more...interesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoting the competitive tone brewing beneath Kiba's voice, as well as how he was eying the soda pitchers nearby, it didn't take long for Hunter to put two and two together, smirking as he did so.  \"Soooo, ya wanna see who can pop their belly button first, do ya...?\" Hunter said in a mock tough guy voice.  Kiba grinned and nodded back before adding, \"Just don't feel too bad when I win.\"  Hunter smirked competitively.  \"Oh, it's on, kiddo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Hunter grabbed two pitchers of soda, setting one down for himself and the other before Kiba, who grabbed his with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers,\" Hunter said, raising his pitcher, while Kiba grinned and did the same.  And in no time at all, both the dog-nin and wolf pulled the pitchers back to their lips and began chugging relentlessly.  Both Naruot and Kurama, after gulping down their current mouthfuls, caught glance at the two, and watched attentively while Akamaru was still too busy practically DIGGING into his pie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, who do ya think is gonna win?\"  Kurama asked eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, tough call.  Had chugging contests with both...and SCHOOLED both, but they DID manage to keep up okay, so it could be a pretty even match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they're both awesome and can eat a lot.  Maybe they'll pop their belly buttons at the same time, so they'd both win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though that's not at all the way Naruto ever looked at any competition or hoped for any similar outcome, he couldn't help but smile at how thoughtful the kit was about even the most miniscule of things, causing him to wrap his arm around the young creatures' shoulders as the duo watched the boy and wolf chug and chug.  All the while, their already ridiculously swollen bellies continued to protrude more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as time continued to tick by...</span></div></div>",

First, he would be brought three of their largest milkshakes. Then, after he'd finished those, he'd be brought sixteen large dishes of ice cream, no toppings. Then, if he were to make it through those, he would be presented with his final obstacle: a monstrous sundae, at least three feet tall and loaded with every single topping the place had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter explaining all of this to Naruto (who looked a bit shocked), she sighed again. \"Again, are you really sure you want to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please say yes, please say yes, pleasepleasepleaseplease....</i> Hunter frantically thought to himself, tail wagging at breakneck speed and a huge grin on his muzzle; only the fact that he was still holding an ice cream cone kept him from rubbing his paws gleefully together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto remained in his position, as though contemplating his choices.

He merely smirked, saying, \"What did you guys expect? I'm pretty hungry after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter barely held in his excitement as the lady at the counter took Naruto to an empty table in the middle of the restaurant. A few employees, with nothing else to do, began to gather around Naruto, with most of them surprisingly excited. The others were just glad that they were alleviated from their boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause the place was small, there were only four employees gathered around, but they were all nice people, and they even began chatting with Hunter and Naruto. The hum of the milkshake machine could be heard, and Naruto's stomach growled in response, making Hunter all the more eager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Hunter had finished his cone, and Naruto was beginning to get a bit feisty, as he was pumped up for the impending feast. He would soon be satisfied, as another employee, who was about Naruto's age himself, walked in carrying three massive glasses that Naruto could probably fit his entire forearm in. Each glass was filled with a classic milkshake flavor, one with vanilla, one with strawberry, and one with chocolate<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe employee then hugged the lady from the counter, implying that he was probably her son. Either way, all six employees who were there at the time were now watching, wondering to see how he attacked his meal. An employee occasionally looked at the door to make sure that there were no customers waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter watched the most intently however, and stared in awe as Naruto took the vanilla, and sucked down the milkshake as fast as he possibly could. Hunter watched as the level of milkshake slowly wend down in the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough no one saw it yet, Naruto's belly was rapidly filling, and soon enough, his stomach began to expand quickly, almost like a balloon filling with water, his stomach area losing its flatness fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could continue, however, he winced in pain as a massive pang of brain freeze took over. Hunter chuckled a bit before receiving a glare from Naruto. Others smirked, while one smiled warmly saying to Naruto, \"Don't worry,...\"</span></div></div>",

Heh, I just assumed since it was an eating contest, it'd be timed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman they'd spoken to earlier-probably the store's owner- chuckled. \"A fair assumption. Still,\" she went on, smiling warmly at Naruto, \"We like to give our contestants as much time as they like; it lets them pace themselves, and it lets them relax and takes some of the pressure off them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinked. \"Huh...pretty thoughtful of you guys,\" he spoke out loud. Some  of the employees looked at him quizzically-after all, it wasn't every day an anthropomorphic wolf came into your shop-but they nonetheless smiled at the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. \"That's great to hear. Still...\" he returned his attention to the partially-finished vanila milkshake. \"...if I'm gonna let a little brain freeze stop me, I'm not fit to be the Hokage!\" With that, he grabbed the vanilla shake container and resumed violently sucking down its contents. His stomach swiftly lost what little flatness it had left, and his stomach had begun taking on a noticeably concave curve, one that only increased as he continued sucking down the shake. Finally, the last of the shake vanished into his gut. Naruto winced and clutched his head with both hands, gritting his teeth and trying to bear the brain freeze. After a few seconds, it had lapsed enough for Naruto to tackle the next shake; the strawberry one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter watched, fascinated, as Naruto sucked down the second shake. \"Wow, lookit him go,\" Hunter thought as the level of shake began to go down, and the concave appearance of his stomach continued to increase. \"Hope he lasts through the last round...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his own stomach rumbled; apparently, the medium cone he'd had earlier hadn't quite been enough.

Naruto, in the meantime, was already towards the bottom of his shake. By this point, his stomach was already pressing on his shirt, and by the time he finished the shake, his shirt had begun to lift off his belly. He finished the last drops of the shake, then he belched loudly, causing his stomach to rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, he took a breather, and he tried to make idle conversation with Hunter, now more willing to warm up to him. After all, he was given all the free ice cream he wanted by a friendly person. It wasn't so bad after all. The two began to tell each other stories, then the employee that Hunter talked to walked in with a mixing bowl-sized dish filled with ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's what I ordered!\" Hunter exclaimed. \"At least you can't complain about the portions!\" Naruto remarked. He then gulped, as he realized that something like that, or bigger, was going to come his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that thought, instead of being deterred, Naruto gained more determination, and instead of using the straw for his last shake, he took the straw out, put the giant glass to his lips, and took large gulps out of the milkshake, wincing a bit once the brain freeze hit him, but pushing through nevertheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the employees were astounded, and Hunter was very excited. While he watched, enthralled, he mindlessly scooped large spoonfuls of his sundae into his mouth, unaware of how much he was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Naruto finished his last shake, his shirt having risen up nearly to his belly button.

Well...\" He put the spoon into his mouth, moving it around in his mouth for a few seconds before replying. \"Well, I'm no good with locations, so I couldn't exactly tell you where...\" he laughed nervously as Naruto raised an eyebrow. \"...but I can tell you I live far away from here, in the woods.\" He scratched the back of his head and smiled. \"It's pretty nice; quiet, peaceful...except when I'm playing videogames.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tilted his head. \"Video...games?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf nodded. \"Yeah, and I dunno what makes more noise: the games, or me when I'm getting my ass kicked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's mouth dropped open. \"Uhhh...\" he muttered, not sure how to react.

Wheeling them in, the employees set four of them on the table, leaving the other twelve on the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gaped as he took in the size of the bowls; they were easily the size of Hunter's bowl individually, but filled even more to the brim with all sorts of different flavors.

Hunter grinned hugely and wagged his tail rapidly, even as he tucked into his own sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Naruto dropped the spoon, having picked the first bowl clean. At this point, his shirt was a good inch or two above his belly button; undeterred, he immediately pulled the second bowl close to him and, after a few seconds of fighting off the brain freeze, began digging into it.</span></div></div>",

Hunter's ears twitched, and he smirked. Naruto, on the other hand, merely stared at him. \"What...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter went on as though he hadn't been interrupted. \"...pretty short, a mechanical arm and leg...and a hell of an appetite.\" He grinned. \"He doesn't usually have much of an opportunity to really stuff himself, but when he does...hoo boy, he goes all out.\" Eyes lighting up, he held his paws up in the air, holding them apart from one another. \"We're talkin' shirt riding up, belt busting, pants button popping off, fly opening up....\" Hunter chuckled again, tail wagging. \"His brother had quite a time hauling him back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, surprised to find himself actually interested in what Hunter was talking about. \"Huh. Who else have you seen stuffing themselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Hunter went on, clearly warming to the topic, \"there's other guy, Natsu Dragneel with a heck of an appetite...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragneel?\" Naruto interrupted, scooping up more ice cream. \"Kinda a weird last name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled. \"Well, that kinda makes sense, considering he's from another land entirely; a place called Fiore, to be specific.\" He grinned widely. \"Plus, he's a wizard; a Dragon Slayer, to be specific.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragon Slayer?\" Naruto repeated. \"So he actually fights dragons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shook his head. \"Not exactly; see, rumor has it he was actually <i>raised</i> by a dragon, and he was the one who taught him that magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...he was raised by a <i>dragon</i>?\" Naruto exclaimed in disbelief. \"Then why the hell did he teach him magic that could probably kill him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You know, I really don't know,\" Hunter conceded. \"One of the universe's great mysteries, I suppose...\" His face lit up. \"Actually, you'll get a chance to meet him later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened, even as he continued scooping ice cream into his maw. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Hunter replied cheerfully. \"Although, I had to use a lot more tranquilizer on him; he's a good guy, but wherever he goes...\" he winced. \"...copious amounts of property damage tend to occur. It's actually that way with a lot of the members of his guild, actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...guild?\" Naruto repeated, a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain later,\" Hunter replied. \"Anyhow, this one time, his best friend, Happy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell kind of name is that?\" Naruto interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged. \"Eh, Natsu named him; actually pretty fitting, for a talking, flying blue cat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just stared back at Naruto. \"...what,\" he finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter waved a paw in the air. \"Like I said, you'll meet both of them later; I didn't have the heart to separate them, so I knocked 'em both out and brought them to town; they should be waking up pretty soon; by the time we get back, actually. Anyway, this one time, Natsu and some of his guildmates stopped at a restaurant to grab a bite after a job, and Happy dared him to order everything on the menu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked. \"Let's just say that afterwards, Mr. Dragneel needed a new belt, new pants...and the owner of the restaurant sued him for collateral damage caused by his belt buckle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto actually snorted a bit at this. \"Seriously? Man, I can't wait to meet this guy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned. \"Yeah, you and me both buddy.\" Something seemed to occur to him, and he looked at the ice cream on the table. \"Hey, ice cream's starting to get runny; better not wait much longer....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Naruto exclaimed, turning back to the ice cream. \"Damn it!\" Narrowing his eyes, he dug his spoon in, rapidly spooning as many mouthfuls into his maw as he could at a time. Soon enough, he'd fallen back into his groove, and his belly once again continued expanding, swelling outwards and pushing against his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, tail wagging, settled back in his seat, deciding to start on his second sundae. <i>Damn, he's not even on the final course yet, and his gut's gettin' nice and big! Can't wait to see what he'll look like once he's finished everything...</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Naruto came to the end of his last bowl of ice cream, a pair of employees were walking in, each holding one side of an immense dish that was easily the size of an entire sink. They finally plopped it down in front of Naruto, nearly breaking the table with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto merely scooped the last bit of his last sundae into his mouth, then immediately dug into the massive pile of ice cream in front of him. In the dish was every singly flavor, sauce, and topping that the shop served, in addition to a copious amount of whipped cream. It really did stack over three feet high, and Hunter and Naruto were amazed that the two employees kept it from falling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter watched, excited, and the employees watched, amazed, Naruto focused on the ice cream, going even faster in a display of gluttony that was even a bit grotesque. Hunter was having difficulty viewing Naruto, due to the massive dish, so he moved next to Naruto, barely dodging a popped pants button as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked down at Naruto's belly to see that it was now pushing on the table quite a bit, now that it was freed from the restraints of the pants button. It pushed down Naruto's zipper all the way to the bottom, and it started to strain the bottom of his shirt. Had there not been a table, or a massive stomach, Naruto's underwear would be showing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that he was way beyond full, Naruto was determined to finish the massive dish of ice cream. With the mere mention of other big eaters that Hunter mentioned, Naruto wanted to show Hunter that he could eat the most out of all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about a third of the way through the dish, Naruto's inseam began to tear. At this point, Naruto's belly strained the table so much that he had to scoot back and rotate himself, his belly wobbling ponderously as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother third, and Naruto's shirt began to tear at the bottom, and his inseam tore even farther. Now, his stomach stuck out about a foot, and it wobbled with each movement he made. Naruto leaned over to get more ice cream, and he felt a strange sensation in his navel. A curious hand reached down to find that Naruto's navel had indeed inverted, and now it stuck out from his massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he slowed down towards the end, Naruto was able to finish the entire feast of ice cream. The employees were all shocked, and Hunter was smiling giddily, patting Naruto in the back with enthusiasm, saying, \"I knew you could do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, however, was green in the face, but he managed to look up at the employees, saying, \"The ice cream was awesome!\" Because Naruto had finished the entire challenge, he got the ice cream for free. Moving was going to be a challenge, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tried standing up, but needed help from Hunter. Soon enough, while Naruto had one hand on his belly, and one on his pants to keep them up, Hunter had an arm draped across Naruto's shoulders, helping to keep Naruto in balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours, Naruto and Hunter finally arrived at the hotel, and they walked up to the room next to the one where Naruto woke up. Inside, Natsu was sleeping on the bed, with Happy curled up on his chest. Naruto and Hunter waited as Natsu snored loudly, sprawled messily across the bed. He was clad in his normal attire, vest and all, and he looked surprisingly peaceful in that position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sat in a small armchair in the corner, his belly taking up the entire space of the arm chair, and then some. Hunter found a chair, and he sat next to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the Natsu you've been talking about?\" Naruto questioned. \"Yeah\" Hunter replied. \"Let me do the talking, though. I don't want him to get too mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Natsu began to wake up, and Happy followed suit. He was very confused, and Hunter explained calmly, much in the same way he did with Naruto. He explained to Natsu how he captured Natsu. It wasn't hard, as Natsu was a fairly heavy sleeper, so Hunter essentially picked him up and took him to the hotel, laying him down on the bed that he woke up in. He balanced Natsu to make sure that Happy would stay in the same place on Natsu's chest, meaning that he would stay asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu was surprisingly calm about it. He talked about how he was bored back in Fiore, as he couldn't find any fun quests to do, so once he found out that Hunter was friendly, he was glad to finally have something to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter then introduced Natsu to Naruto, who had fallen asleep himself before Natsu woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's out now, but he's also a big eater, as you can clearly see!\" Hunter exclaimed. Natsu replied with, \"Holy crap! How much did he eat?!\" Natsu exclaimed, as Happy flew over and playfully prodded Naruto's massive belly. \"3 giant milkshakes, 16 bowls of ice cream, and an immense sundae!\" Natsu was at a loss for words as he walked up, poking Naruto's belly curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon afterwards, Natsu's belly growled this time, and he scratched the back of his head, saying, \"I think I could show you how much of a big eater I am right now. Can we get something to eat?\" with Happy adding in his trademark \"Aye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter then said, \"...\"</span></div></div>",

Hunter chuckled sheepishly and said, \"....Aaaaaaas soon as he wakes up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Hunter and Natsu continued chatting amongst themselves for a little while, until Naruto slowly but eventually awoke from his deep slumber.  Rubbing his eyes groggily, he turned to see Hunter standing in front of him eagerly.  \"Rise'n shine, Naruto!  There's someone I'd like you to meet!\"  Hunter stepped back, revealing Natsu and Happy standing behind him.  \"Natsu Dragneel?  Meet Naruto Uzumaki!  And of course, the little fella over there is Happy!\"  Natsu grinned a wide mouthed grin while Naruto, still tired and full, smirked as best he could.  \"Hey, man!  Heard a lot about'cha!\"  Natsu said as he offered a handshake, which Naruto accepted with a smirk.  \"Heard a lot about you, too.  Nice to finally meet ya.\" responded Naruto, still rather dazed.  \"So, Hunter here tells me you've got quite the appetite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned then nodded, as he patted his still relatively bloated belly proudly for emphasis.  \"As you can see, heh.  I hear you ain't half bad yourself,\" responded Naruto, to which Natsu grinned toothily and said, \"...Let's just say, I can close a restaurant or two if I'm hungry enough.\"  The two youths laughed, when suddenly a loud rumbling once again emanated from Natsu's bare stomach.  Chuckling sheepishly, the young Fire Mage rubbed the back of his spiky pink head and said, \"Was actually thinkin' of showing Hunter here just how much I could put away.  Feel like taggin' along?  Could give us a chance to get to know each other a lil better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Naruto wasn't feeling too hungry, he decided to tag along anyway.  So, he said, \"Eh, sure, why not?  You seem like a cool enough guy.  And plus...\" Naruto smirked a bit and continued with, \"...I'm kinda curious to see just how much you can really put away.\"  Natsu grinned as he rubbed his stomach eagerly and said, \"Hehe, that won't be a problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the four headed out in search of a restaurant still open for business.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto grinned, leaning back in his chair and rubbing his belly eagerly. <i>Ah, man!</i> he thought excitedly, licking his lips. <i>This is gonna be the best round yet!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days ago, Naruto had caught wind of a ramen-eating competition going down in some village a long ways away from Konoha, with a sizable cash prize for the winner. Never one to turn down free ramen (and being a little strapped for cash at the current moment), Naruto had eagerly asked Tsunade if he could leave the village for a few weeks. Reluctantly, Tsunade had agreed; after all, Naruto had been cooped up in the village for a little while with no missions, with little else to do than train, stroll through the village, or hang out at his apartment, and some travel might do him well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Tsunade had given him the OK, Naruto had rushed back to his apartment, packed his things, and headed out, eagerly anticipating the ramen to come. He'd considered asking Kiba and Akamaru to tag along-after all, for some reason, he and them had seem to had gotten really tight lately (though, for some weird reason, he couldn't remember exactly HOW)-but they were out on a mission with their team. Naruto had gotten momentarily disgruntled at this realization, but had shrugged it off; maybe once he won the cash prize, he'd treat them to something once they got back. A new steak place had just opened up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the village where the contest where the contest was being held, Naruto had found, to his surprise, that it was being held in a rather unique manner. Rather than competing at once with all the other contestants, each contestant would be paired up against another for a round of ramen-eating, and whoever won would compete the next day against someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked; unsurprisingly, he had totally demolished all the competition he had come up against. While the other contestant would, invariably, end up groaning and rubbing their aching stomachs, several bowls of ramen left uneaten, Naruto would be laughing, leaning back in his chair and smacking his stuffed belly, every single bowl he'd been given stacked up high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had been even better, Naruto thought gleefully, was that with each successive round, the amount of ramen bowls served had increased. During the first round, he had eaten enough to make his belly bulge noticeably against his jacket. The next day, the amount he had consumed had allowed his stomach to push further out. And, after the previous day's round, his jacket (and the black short-sleeved t-shirt with the red flame spiral on the chest underneath it) had been pushed far up enough to expose his belly button but not much else, and for him to have to unbutton his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wonder how much we're gonna hafta eat today?</i> Naruto wondered, rubbing his palms together eagerly. Seeing as how this was the final round, and the one that would determine the winner, doubtless there would be many more bowls than before; after all, if he and the other finalist had gotten this far, they'd have to be able to handle that much, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at space beside him, scowling a bit. <i>Speaking of which, where is he?</i> the blonde thought irritably as he took in the empty folding chair that sat to his side. <i>The final round's about to start! What the hell's taking him so long?</i> He folded his arms, slouching irritably. <i>Seriously, when that jerk gets here, I'm gonna give him a piece of my...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! This where the final round is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the high voice, Naruto turned, mouth opening in an angry retort...but stopped short as he saw the individual-no, the contestant, he realized-that had made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, the contestant was a young boy, no older than 12 or 13 years old. He was about the same height as most other kids his age, with short, messy reddish hair, a few freckles across his face, and bright green eyes. He was clad in brown khaki shorts, sandals, and a long-sleeved red t-shirt. This was all ordinary enough, save for one thing: the fact that he wore a burnished, golden locket about his neck, dangling at the end of a long chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. <i>Huh...that's a pretty nice lookin' necklace. Wonder where he got it?</i> At the back of his mind, he wondered how this kid had managed to make it this far; he was quite slim, and rather fit for his age...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Naruto? You OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shook his head, focusing on the boy. \"Y-yeah, I'm fine, I was just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened. \"Wait, how did you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy recoiled a bit. \"U-uh,\" he stammered, wincing. \"I, um...heard one of the other contestants say your name! Naruto Uzumaki, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised an eyebrow. \"Um, yeah, that's my name. So you heard one of the other contestants say it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy nodded vigorously. \"Y-yeah! Sorry to just blurt it out like that.\" Calming down a bit, he scratched the back of his head. \"Didn't mean to freak you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of himself, Naruto smiled. \"Ah, that's OK,\" he assured the youth. \"Just got a little surprised is all.\" He leaned over and patted the empty chair. \"Why don't ya take a seat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though a switch were being flipped, the boy's expression switched from sheepish and apologetic to one of absolute delight, a wide grin spreading across his face. \"Really? Thanks!\" Still grinning, he walked over and plopped right down, folding his hands on his lap and smiling at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was taken aback, to say the least. The kid had gotten that happy just from his invitation to sit down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking it off, he turned to face the boy, giving him his best smile. \"So, uh, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youth grinned. \"Kotetsu. Just Kotetsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow at that last part, Naruto nonetheless smiled. \"Kotetsu, huh? That's a cool name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing a bit sheepishly, Kotetsu rubbed the back of his head. \"Aww, thanks! 'Course, 'Naruto's' a pretty cool name, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. \"Ya really think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu nodded eagerly. \"Yeah! I mean, I try not to say stuff I don't mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled. \"Sounds like a pretty good way to do things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu grinned. \"Yeah, my friends all appreciate it...\" he winced. \"...even if doesn't always work out so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned. \"Huh? Whaddaya mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu gulped, looking at Naruto. He said nothing at first. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has a girl ever asked you how she looks in an outfit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gaped at the boy, unsure of what to say. Then, he and Kotetsu locked eyes, blinked....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and burst out laughing. \"N-no way!\" Naruto gasped through his hysteria. \"Y-you actually told a girl sh-she...\" whatever else he had to say was lost in a fit of giggles. Kotetsu said nothing, only clutching his middle and nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they laughed, Naruto privately wondered how he was laughing so earnestly with this kid he'd only just met, nice as he was. And yet, as they succumbed to further laughter, he was struck by just how...<i>right</i> it felt. A part of him was even wondering if he'd ever met this kid before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sound of loud coughing cut through the air. Opening their eyes, they saw the contest officiant standing and looking at them, looking rather befuddled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh!\" Kotetsu gasped, taking deep breaths to get his laughter under control. \"I-is the contest ready to begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded numbly. \"I-if you're ready...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing a bit, Naruto sat upright in his seat. \"Y-yeah, we're ready.\" At this, a determined grin suddenly split across his face. \"So what are ya waiting for? Bring it on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to him, Kotetsu smirked and planted his hands on the table, rising out of his seat a bit. \"Yeah! Don't keep us waiting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit taken aback, the man nonetheless nodded and walked toward the kitchen, where the bowls were being prepared. He wasn't the only one; Naruto turned to look at Kotetsu with a confused look. \"Ya like ramen that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu winked. \"Yep! It's one of my favorite foods!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed, slugging the boy playfully in the shoulder. \"Ya know what? I think I like you better already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf at all possible, Kotetsu's smile grew even wider at this, and Naruto couldn't help but smile in return. The kid was so cheery; it was almost impossible not to admire that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to chat idly for a bit, and Naruto was surprised at how easily the conversation came. This kid was really something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the man returned, bearing two huge, steaming bowls of ramen. Bringing them toward the table, he set one in front of each of them. \"As usual, the rules are the same,\" the man began. \"After the initial two bowls, our volunteers will keep on bringing more out in a steady stream. There is no time limit; the first person to finish all their bowls is the winner.\" The man bowed. \"Good luck to you both.\" With that, he turned and headed back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys each took a deep whiff of their ramen, practically drooling. Kotetsu was the first to break the silence. \"Well, better get started!\" he chirped, splitting a pair of chopsticks. He beamed at the older boy. \"Good luck, Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised at the boy's sportsmanship, Naruto nonetheless smiled. \"Good luck to you too, Kotetsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they grinned, nodded, and dove into their bowls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now, at no point had it ever been a secret of how vastly Naruto adored scarfing down ramen as much as he did.  Even as he powered through one round after another, his competition may have been relentless, but Naruto would always come out on top.  One could argue the young man was far more determined than his vigorous competitors, though the reality was quite simple; he loved eating ramen far too much to give up.  It had seemed to an edge he'd retained against each rival in this competition.  But not this time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather, this boy; Kotetsu, he was not only packing away the same amount of ramen at the same rapid pace as Naruto, but he did so with an equally determined glint in his eyes, and yet, a big hearty smile on his youthful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This kid's really havin' fun, huh...</i>  Naruto thought to himself, unable to suppress a smirk as he continued scarfing down a seemingly endless stream of noodles from his bowl.  He was scarfing down as much as he could possibly fit into his mouth, taking big hearty gulps after chewing and slurping vigorously, watching as Kotetsu; without missing a beat, did just the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as he and Kotetsu wolfed down their ramen, one thing kept creeping into the back of Naruto's head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow <i>familiar</i> this all felt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But...what's familiar about this...?</i> he thought, slurping down more and more noodles as he did so.  <i>Having a ramen eating contest with some random kid I just met...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of this nagging feeling, however, he tried his best to push the thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterall, this WAS the final round.  And Naruto most certainly couldn't afford to be distracted when he had to bring his A-game...doubly so when against such a worthy adversary...one Naruto was all but certain he'd had to have met before...for some reason or another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, he and Kotetsu ate and ate, their first massive bowls depleting amply as; already, both their bellies began to expand with the sheer volume of ramen being ingested in so short a duration of time.  It had appeared as though there was a notable bump beneath both Naruto's T-Shirt and Kotetsu's long sleeved shirt.  And yet, despite that, not a one showed any signs o flagging any time soon, as they messily devoured their bowls at the same pace; something very few could admit to doing against Naruto...ESPECIALLY when it came to ramen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin no time at all, both the elder blonde and younger reddish headed boy had drained their first bowls clean, and were both now sitting back in their chairs, eager for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, ain't nothin' more satisfying than a big, steaming bowl'uh ramen, is there, Kotetsu!\" exclaimed Naruto as he smacked his belly proudly, awaiting as the volunteers took both bowls and proceeded to get the next ones ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu simply smiled, rubbing his own tummy in satisfaction as he nodded and said, \"You said it!  Ramen's just plain awesome!\"  His smile then turned to one a bit more impish as he added, \"<i>Althoooough</i>...as good as this stuff is...when it comes to ramen, NOTHING beats Ichiraku's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Naruto was about cheer in agreement, but immediately stopped in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, y-you've had Ichiraku's...?\"  Naruto asked, with an air of suspicion in his voice.  To his surprise, however, Kotetsu didn't reciprocate his suspicion, but instead, bopped his head happily.  \"Yep!  Sure have!  Not at their actual restaurant though, a really good friend of mine shared it with me some time back.\"  He shut his eyes and tilted his head skyward, licking his lips and smiling warmly as he added, \"But the second I tasted it...?  Ohhhh man, it was just...magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Naruto couldn't help but smirk as he watched Kotetsu practically salivating at the mere mention of Ichiraku's.  No doubt it had to be more than coincidence, but how; Naruto simply couldn't say.  No, rather, his smirk once again became a smile as he nudged the younger boy playfully in the arm and said, \"Heh, y'know what, Kotetsu?  You're alright in my book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu turned right back at Naruto and beamed happily, about to thank him just as the volunteers returned with another set of massive, steamy bowls; the aroma just wafting through their nostrils and practically begging to be eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd both Naruto and Kotetsu were more than happy to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like the first bowl, neither Naruto nor Kotetsu wasted an ounce of time messily and rapidly scarfing down as much ramen as their maws could possibly hold as they heartily gulped and dove right back for more and more...all at the same pace...neck and neck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with the first bowls, again, their stomachs continued to bloat up just a little more and more, making the bulges beneath both their shirts a bit more noticeable as the two pressed on and on.  With a steady mixture of determination and sheer joy, their second bowls were both demolished in practically no time at all.  And it was clear once the chopsticks went down, neither one was getting full anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping loudly, Naruto smacked his lips then turned to Kotetsu as the volunteers once again took the bowls off the table.  \"Heh, y'know something...I really gotta hand it to ya, kid.  Ain't too often I come across ANYONE who can put away as much ramen as fast as I can, the way you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Kotetsu just chuckled and rubbed the back of his head.  \"Hehe, thanks!  But then again, how often do you eat alongside someone who loves ramen as much as you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, fair point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Naruto found it strange how easy it was for him to chat with this boy so easily and freely, but his pondering was soon stilted when the volunteers returned with their third bowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, both Naruto and Kotetsu shared a competitive, but notably good natured glance and smirk, then proceeded to tear right into their third massive bowls of ramen mercilessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as more time went on...</span></div></div>",

Seems that way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde tilted his head. \"Speaking of which...have we met before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the reddish-haired boy started, eyes widening. \"Wh-what makes ya say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuzzling a bit at the boy's reaction, Naruto shrugged. \"I-I dunno; you just seem really familiar for some reason...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu blinked. \"Well, uh...\" he chuckled nervously, rubbing the back of his head. \"Guess I just have one of those kinds of faces, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, a bit confused, blinked in return. \"N-no, it's more than that. I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, ramen's here!\" Kotetsu blurted suddenly. Starting a bit, Naruto looked up and noticed that, yes, the volunteers had brought out the fourth round of bowls. As the delectable aroma wafted into his nostrils, he grinned a bit, and allowed his confusion to be pushed to the back of his mind, at least for the moment. <i>Well, I guess I could always ask him afterwards...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bowls were set in front of the two competitors, and, of course, once they hit the table, both youths grabbed their chopsticks and immediately began slurping them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mmmm,</i> Kotetsu thought gleefully as he slurped a veritable stream of noodles and toppings into his waiting mouth. <i>This was a great idea. I mean, I get to eat a ton of ramen for free! How cool is that?</i> Beaming, he continued slurping the noodles down, going faster and faster...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, even as he continued slurping his own noodles down, marveled at the sheer speed with which Kotetsu was devouring his bowl. <i>Wow, the kid really likes ramen, doesn't he?</i> Unconsciously, he slowd down a bit, watching the boy closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe happy grin upon his face...the sheer eagerness with which he tackled the ramen...the bright spark in his eyes that spoke of someone having the time of their life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes narrowed. <i>Alright, I KNOW I've met this kid somewhere before. But...this is my first time meeting him, right?</i>  He screwed up his brow. <i>Agh, this is so frustraEEEEEHHHHH?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes bulged as, with a smile on his face, Kotetsu lifted the bowl up to his mouth and gulped down the hearty broth. After a few seconds, he slammed the bowl down with a satisfied \"Ahhhhh.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He's done already?!</i> Naruto thought, incredulously. Looking down, he noted that he still had a little over half of his own bowl left to go. Grunting, he lowered his head and began gulping them down as fast as he could. After all, friendly competition or not, it was still a competition, and there was no way he wasn't going to do his damnedest to come out on top!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as Naruto continued guzzling his noodles, a volunteer came by, grabbed Kotetsu's empty bowl, and set another, full bowl down. Kotetsu's face lit up. <i>Oh wow, they're bringing new bowls at the same tiee they take the empty ones now?</i> He licked his lips. <i>Great!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving the volunteer a nod of thanks, the boy immediately dove into his fifth bowl, slurping up the noodles happily. As he did so, though, he glanced over at Naruto. He winced as he saw the blonde examining him, even as he devoured what was left of his fifth bowl. <i>Ah, man; I'm sorry, Naruto...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning his attention to his own bowl, he continued slurping up his noodles. <i>I want to show him so bad...</i> He shook his head slightly, even as he gulped down a mouthful and went back in for more. <i>N-no; doin' it out in public would be a really bad idea. I'll show him after the contest...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the boys continued musing to themselves, they did not let up in the slightest. Soon, Naruto finished his fourth bowl; however, even as the attendant brought him his fifth bowl, Kotetsu had already finished drinking the broth of his own bowl. Both boys stomachs had gotten a bit more rounded, and they would doubtless only continue to do so as the contest drew on....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even as Naruto soldiered on, ravenously stuffing as many noodles into his mouth as his cheeks could possibly permit, the younger boy continued to get his attention.  Naruto ate and ate relentlessly and quickly, yet also watched as Kotetsu was tearing into his sixth bowl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did so, despite still being behind in this competition, Naruto couldn't help but smirk a bit as he watched the young red haired boy chow down.  Everything about his demeanor was just so positively uplifting.  Even in the final round of a ramen eating competition, this young man; in every single sense of the word, just looked so damn<i>...happy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That...that's what's so familiar...!</i> Naruto thought, still slurping away as he did so.  <i>But...why...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, he shook those thoughts off; if at least only temporarily, and wolfed down his ramen voraciously, chewing and gulping again and again as fast as he possibly could without choking (seeing as that almost happened a few times in this competition already...)  Before long, Naruto found himself draining the zesty broth of his fifth bowl, and; like clockwork, the volunteer took it away and handed him his sixth bowl promptly afterwards.  And; much to Naruto's relief, Kotetsu was also still on his sixth bowl, though not much left to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, time to get serious...</i> Naruto thought, before taking massive scoops of noodles and shoving them straight into his eager maw.  He winced a bit as he found himself gulping down hearty strains of noodles at once, but he pressed on, more than determined to pick up the pace by any means necessary.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commotion was even enough to draw young Kotetsu's attention as he turned his head and; with a surprising sense of amusement, grinned at the sight of Naruto plowing through his sixth bowl.  <i>Woooooow!  I've NEVER seen him eat so much at once!  That's awesome!</i> the boy thought gleefully, still working on his bowl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShockingly, however, by the time Kotetsu had finally finished his sixth bowl and slammed it happily on the table, the sound was amplified by a second bowl hitting the table right alongside him.  With a hearty gasp for air, Naruto smacked his lips and rubbed his much fuller belly in eager anticipation for more.  At this, Kotetsu beamed happily at the elder boy and said, \"Holy moly!  You were a full bowl behind a little while ago, yet ya managed to catch up?  That's so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Naruto grinned.  \"Heh, what can I say, kid?  I gotta give ya a run for y'er money, don't I?\"  Suddenly, Naruto burped loudly, but much to his surprise, Kotetsu just giggled with amusement, earning a chuckle from him in return, until the volunteers returned with both Naruto's and Kotetsu's seventh bowls, taking their previous bowls away in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, guess it's all tied up, huh?\" Naruto noted, earning a nod and a smile from the younger boy.  \"Yep!  Buuuut it's still anyone's game, right?\"  Kotetsu replied, earning an almost impish grin from Naruto as he playfully nudged the boys arm.  \"Sure is, so don't let up now, got it?\"  Kotetsu grinned an equally impish grin and said, \"Wouldn't think of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, both boys once again wished each other good luck, and dove straight into their seventh bowls, notably at a slightly slower pace, but every bit as relentless as they powered through a seemingly infinite amount of ramen noodles.  All the while, their bellies continued to swell out to increasingly larger and larger proportions.  Kotetsu's stomach had swollen to the point where a sliver of his stomach was now showing beneath his shirt.  Naruto's jacket had pressed against his belly so greatly that both the bottom of that as well as the T-Shirt beneath it hiked up and started showing a sliver of flesh in the process.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, despite that, not a single one let up, once again draining their bowls completely empty to the last drop and slamming them down at the same time with a hearty sigh of relief and eager anticipation for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon receiving their eighth bowls and having their seventh bowls taken off, the two young men wasted little to no time at all getting to ample work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the two boys ate and ate...and ate some more, and as time began to press on...</span></div></div>",

Within a matter of minutes, they had demolished their eight bowls, just as the volunteers brought them their ninth bowls. Thanking them, they quickly dove into <i>those</i> as well, continuing to devour them with gusto and enthusiasm as the zesty flavors assailed their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, those bowls were demolished as well, and they got started on their tenth bowls. And, after they'd devoured <i>those</i>, they got stated on their eleventh bowls. Then their twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout all of this, the two managed to keep pace with which other as they plowed through their bowls. Naruto, in addition to simply loving ramen that much, did not wish to fall behind again, especially considering the speed the kid was going. Kotetsu...well, Kotetsu just seemed to be enjoying his ramen that damn much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they packed away one oversized bowl after another, their stomachs slowly continued to bulge more and more as heaping helpings of broth and noodles entered them. Kotetsu's stomach continued to grow, slowly hiking up his long-sleeved shirt further and further, exposing more and more skin. In fact, even as he shoveled noodles into his mouth with one hand, his other wandered down to his growing tummy, rubbing it and grinning as he felt the bare skin. <i>Whoa, my gut's really growing, isn't it?</i> His eyes lit up. <i>Wonder how bit its gonna be done by the time we're done?</i> Spurred on by this thought, he returned his attention fully to his current bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Naruto's stomach also bulged bit by bit, slowly hiking his jacket and the shirt underneath up further, albeit a bit more slowly than Kotetsu's shirt. Naruto, even as he devoured his ramen, frowned. <i>Man, kinda startin' to be a tight fit here...</i> he mused. It wasn't particularly uncomfortable, at least not yet, but as he glanced over at Kotetsu, still devouring his ramen with gusto, he screwed up his brow. <i>Considering how well Kotetsu seems to be doing, my jacket bein' a tight fit might be a problem somewhere down the line...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, as soon as Naruto slammed his sixteenth bowl down on the table, he leaned back in his chair, grabbed the zipper of his jacket, and pulled it down, completely unzipping and opening the garment, completely revealing his short-sleeved black t-shirt with a stylized red flame spiral on the front. Obviously, it now rode slightly up, exposing a surprising bit of skin. Sighing in relief, he leaned back in his seat, patting his belly contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu, even as he slammed his own empty bowl upon the table, glanced over at Naruto, rubbing his belly through his opened jacket. He grinned widely as he caught sight of the garment underneath it. \"Wow, Naruto, that's a really cool shirt!\" he exclaimed, licking his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, surprised, looked up from his ministrations at Kotetsu. \"Ya really think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTe younger boy nodded eagerly. \"Sure do!\" He gestured to the symbol on the shirt. \"Especially that flery spiral thingy; it's really awesome-looking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened, surprised. \"You...you really think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu beamed. \"Don't ya remember? I try not to say things I don't mean.\" He chuckled a bit scratching the back of his head. \"'Sides, I used to have a shirt that sorta looked like that when I was little; I kinda have fond memories of it, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled. \"Really?\" Kotetsu nodded eagerly in return, even as the volunteers brought the new bowls along and took the empty ones. \"Well, I gotta say, kid, you really have great taste in clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu beamed, chuckling sheepishly. \"Awww, you're too nice, Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked, picking his chopsticks back up. \"Eh, don't sweat it kid; I try not to say stuff I don't mean, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu grinned, grabbing his chopsticks as well. \"I can appreciate that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn't help but smile; Kotetsu was so friendly, enthusiastic, and genuine....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Feels so...so damn familiar....</i> Naruto mused, dipping his chopsticks into his bowl and starting to slurp up more ramen. <i>But why...?</i> Shaking this thought off, he started tearing into his bowl with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu, even as he began slurping up his ramen, glanced out the side of his eyes at the older blonde. <i>I'm sorry, Naruto,</i> the other boy thought. <i>I know you're confused right now.</i>  He smiled, turning his attention fully to his ramen so Naruto couldn't see. <i>Don't worry, pal; after the contest is over and everything's digested, I'll show who you I really am...</i> His stomach churned with a mixture of anticipation and dread. <i>And then...and then everything's gonna make sense....</i> Fighting aside the anxiety, he threw himself fully into his bowl. Within record time, both boys had drained their bowls entirely, just as the attendants brought out more bowls. They tore through these as well....as they did the bowls after those, and the bowls following those....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, their stomachs continued to bulge, their respective shirts slowly hiking up further and further and exposing more and more skin. In addition, their respective pants began feeling a bit snug, but they ignored this, powering on, neither one wanting to fall behind the other. As such, they plowed through their eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth bowls, hiking their shirts up even further and starting to expose a bit of their belly buttons. All the while, the slight snugness in their waistlines increased...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they gulped down the broth to their twenty-first bowls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The score remained all tied up still and both youths looked to be flagging a bit at this point, now rubbing their engorged midsections tenderly as the volunteers promptly took their previous bowls and handed off their twenty second bowls to each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh man,\" griped Naruto, rubbing his bloated belly soothingly, feeling it constrain against his pants considerably.  Kotetsu, groaning a bit himself, fared no better, with his own rounded belly pressing firmly into his pants button as well.  \"L-lotta ramen, huh?\" remarked Kotetsu, earning a nod from the elder boy.  \"Not that it's a bad thing, h-heh...but our pants might be disagreeing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Naruto couldn't help but chuckle.  \"Oof...took the words right outta my mouth, kiddo...luckily...there's a solution to that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, Naruto reached over his immensely swollen stomach over to the button of his pants, fumbling tremendously as he tried to reach over his currently massive midsection.  Kotetsu watched and couldn't help but giggle a bit at the silly sight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh...\" gasped Naruto with sweet relief as; after all his fumbling, he finally managed to unbutton his pants.  The results of which, caused his already swollen belly to push outward through the front of his pants, pulling his zipper down all the way as his stomach expanded with the additional free room.  At the same time, his shirt hiked up, causing it to rise well above his exposed belly button.  Naruto, meanwhile, just slouched in his chair with a goofy but blissful look on his face while he patted his belly happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoooooly crap...did I need that...\" Naruto remarked.  He then glanced at Kotetsu curiously and said, \"Hey, kid, aren'tcha gonna unbutton your pants too?  It's gonna make keeping up kinda hard if your gut's caught in your pants like that.\"  To emphasize this point, he gestured towards Kotetsu's tummy and that it was still firmly constricted by the front of his pants.  Wincing a bit at this, Kotetsu nonetheless smiled and said, \"Heh, I appreciate the concern, Naruto, really!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, his warm smile grew to be a bit more impish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuuuuuut there's a lil trick someone taught me a while back that I've come to rely on in situations like this,\" Kotetsu remarked, patting his belly for emphasis, earning a curious glance from Naruto, who nonetheless shrugged and turned his attention to his next bowl.  \"Well, so long as you're absolutely certain, kiddo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving the elder boy a wink, Kotetsu also turned his attention to his bowl, and at the same time, both boys tore right into their noodles.  Naruto was working at a much easier and free pace, now that he'd unbuttoned his pants and given his belly some breathing room.  Whereas Kotetsu was notably struggling a bit due to his pants constricting his stomach even further.  On occasion, Naruto would glance over at the boy with a mixture of sympathy for the undeniable discomfort he must have been feeling right about now, and yet, a hint of suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just what is this kid planning to do...?  Why take a chance when you're on the final round...?</i> mused Naruto, who nonetheless, shook those thoughts off and dove right back into his ramen noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kotetsu found himself soldiering on, wincing in pain and discomfort as his belly pressed further and further into the increasingly tighter front of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rgh...oh man, it hurts so bad...</i> the poor youth thought as he nonetheless shoveled as much ramen into his mouth as he could possibly fit.  Then, after gulping it down and feeling his pants getting tighter and tighter, a strained but notable grin grew over his face.  <i>C'mon, just keep on pushin'...it's gonna be sooooooo worth it when ya do...</i>  Then, he glanced over at Naruto for a moment and smiled even as he struggled to stuff more ramen into his slightly less than eager maw.  <i>Heehee, I'll bet Naruto's gonna be surprised by this, BIG time...hope he still appreciates how awesome it is as much as he used to...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was now a slight but notable lead Naruto had obtained over his younger competition.  Though, due to the sheer volume of ramen the teen had ingested already, his pace had slowed down considerably.  Kotetsu, on the other hand, struggled and struggled, until finally, Naruto; seeing the strained look on the boys' face, frowned and had to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Kotetsu, ya sure you don't wanna unbutton your pants?  I get you're trying to do something else, but I don't want'cha to lose this thing over something as silly as a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Naruto could finish that statement...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*POP!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a massively audible SNAP, the button of Kotetsu's pants popped clean off and fired right above the crowd; a proverbial grand slam...but for a pants button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with that forceful release, came yet another great release.  Like Naruto, Kotetsu's bloated belly soon expanded freely and outward from the front of his pants, pushing most of his zipper down, and hiking his shirt up an ample amount to expose more flesh above his belly button.  Naruto simply sat there, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kotetsu?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, MUCH better!\" the boy exclaimed, sighing with great relief and smiling an oh so blissful smile as he slapped his belly happily and merrily, causing it to bounce freely just a bit, much to his amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" Naruto exclaimed.  \"T-that...that was...freakin' AWESOME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Kotetsu just chuckled and rubbed the back of his head sheepishly.  \"Heh, yeah, well, it's just kinda something I picked up when I was younger.  Feels WAY more satisfying to have all that pressure just blast off your gut at once, y'know?\"  At that, Kotetsu's smile became a bit more on the goofy side of bliss as he slouched back happily patting his stomach as he did so.  Naruto couldn't help but snicker a bit, grinning mischievously as he too; recalled all the times he'd ever blasted his button off his pants to free his own stomach in times of heavy feasting.  Enough so that he felt compelled to say, \"Y'know, normally, I do too, but I kinda figured I'd play it safe since we're so far into the last round...heh, gotta hand it to ya, kid.  Doing that now?  Pretty gutsy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on reflex, he reached over and playfully ruffled Kotetsu's head, earning a laugh from the pre-teen, who smiled warmly; internally thinking, <i>Heehee...just like old times...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, however, was a bit more perplexed.  <i>W-why'd I do that...?</i>  He thought to himself, calmly taking his hand aside, but nonetheless, perplexed.  Catching this, Kotetsu decided to help the elder boy out by playfully jabbing his arm.  \"Well, I dunno bout'chu, Naruto, but now that we both got room, whadduya say we get back to tearing up some ramen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, shaking off his internal musings, turned to the boy and smiled confidently.  \"Sounds like a plan, kiddo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, just like before, the two young men were right back into their bowls, both with a bit more vigor and pep in each bite, scarfing down more and more ramen while their bellies continued to peak forward little by little with each passing gulp, remaining neck in neck for a good while, until their twenty second bowls were drained clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys smacked their lips and leaned back in their chairs with their hands rested atop their bellies and in unison, burped loudly, turning to each other and laughing uproariously amongst each other until their twenty third bowls had been delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two powered on, chugging through their noodles as their gullets continued to swell and swell until, after some doing, they had finished their twenty third bowls.  Then their twenty fourth...fifth...sixth...seventh...eighth...ninth...until at last, both boys, packed to the absolute brim, had reached their thirtieth bowls...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"W-well,\" Naruto moaned, rubbing his stomach with both hands and looking down at his thirtieth and final bowl, \"Th-this is it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Kotetsu agreed, burping a bit queasily. \"J-just one more bowl, a-and then we're done...\" He winced as he looked down at his steaming bowl. He loved ramen, and he was gonna do everything in his power to eat this one last bowl...but he was just so <i>full</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, of course, was a fact that the audience did not need to be reminded of. After downing 29 huge bowls of ramen each, both boys' stomachs were ridiculously swollen, each looking as though they were pregnant with quadruplets. Their shirts had long since come to rest completely on top of their engorged midsections, fully exposing the appendages for all to see. In addition, they had both had to scoot back a bit so their bellies didn't press into the table. And, though none of the audience could see it from where they were (thankfully), both of their flies were completely opened, allowing their undergarments to see the light of day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys spent a minute or so rubbing their bellies, trying to coax some of the discomfort out, and looking down at their final bowls. They just had to finish this last one, and then they'd be finished...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the boys slowly looked at one another. \"W-well,\" Naruto began, only for him to start as Kotetsu smiled weakly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...may the best man win,\" the younger boy finished. In spite of his obvious discomfort, there was an odd sort of eager glint in his eyes. Naruto blinked, a bit taken aback. <i>Wow...he has this much enthusiasm even when he's about to burst?</i> the blonde thought, perplexed. As if to prove this, Kotetsu picked up his chopsticks, took some noodles and toppings into them, and began slurping them up. He was going at a much slower pace than before, obviously, owing to his overpacked tummy, but that pace was nonetheless steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gaped at the youth for a moment. <i>Wow, he really wasn't kidding...</i> Then, in spite of himself, he smiled. <i>Well, if he's giving it his all...</i> Smirking, he picked his chopsticks up. <i>...then I guess I better, too!</i> With that, he dug his chopsticks in, and soon he was slurping at the same slow but steady pace as the young red-haired boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes ticked by as the two continued slurping away at their bowls. Their pace was slow, but they never let themselves slow down; after all, this was the final round, and stuffed to the brim or not, ramen was still ramen. They would occasionally stop to burp or rub their bellies to coax some relief into them, but they would always go right back to their bowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes ticked by, and the level of ramen steadily continued to deplete, the crowd watched with rapt attention; the two contestants, slow as they were, were nonetheless neck and neck. At this point, it was anyone's game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu, even as he slurped away, frowned. <i>Aw, man; gut's feelin' tight, but my belly-button's not feeling funny.</i> He shrugged, continuing to slurp away. <i>Ah, well; guess I can't always pop it out...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime continued to go by, and as the boys got closer and closer to the end of their bowls, their faces began turning a slight shade of green, as their overpacked tummies pleaded with them to stop before they exploded. They paid their traitorous midsections no mind, however, and soldiered on, until, at last, they had depleted their bowls of all noodles, leaving only the broth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching queasily, Naruto glanced over at Kotetsu. \"W-well, all that's left is the broth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu, belching a bit as well, nonetheless smirked good-naturedly. \"Guess it's anyone's game now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey couldn't help it; the boys grinned at one another, grabbed their bowls lifted them to their lips, and, before their stomachs could give another ache of protest, tilted them back, gulping down the hearty broth as fast as they dared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd watched, utterly silent. Who would finish first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, both contestants reached a point where there was only a tiny bit of broth left in their bowls each. <i>Just...a little...more...</i> Naruto and Kotetsu thought in unison. To this end, they tilted the bowls back even further, letting what was left of it flow toward their throats....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...only for Naruto's eyes to widen, his cheeks to bulge, and a truly explosive belch to escape from his maw:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, he happened to be holding the bowl up to his face at this time, which, of course, resulted in the bowl clattering to the table and what was left of the broth to splatter on his face. Kotetsu stared at Naruto out the side of his face, unsure whether to ask whether he was alright or gush about how awesome of a burp that was. However, he quickly remembered that he only had a little broth left, and, as Naruto was frantically wiping his face, the younger boy grinned cheekily and gulped down the rest of his bowl. \"Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!\" Kotetsu exclaimed as he slammed the bowl on the table. \"That was soooooo good...\" Sighing and licking his lips, he slumped back in his seat, patting his overstuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Naruto muttered, shaking what was left of the broth off his face. He turned to face Kotetsu...and his jaw dropped as he saw Kotetsu contentedly smacking his belly, his bowl bone-dry. A single thought ran through Naruto's mind:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd stared, equally flabbergasted. No one said anything for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, everyone erupted into cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a winner!\" the contest officiant declared, striding over Kotetsu and hoisting his arm in the air. The boy said nothing, but simply grinned sheepishly and waved at the crowd with his other arm. <i>Heh; almost thought I wasn't gonna make it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned toward Naruto to compliment him on the effort he'd given...but his smile faded as he saw the absolutely shocked look on Naruto's face. <i>Oh man....is he...is he mad I beat him...? I mean, he was always so nice, but he's crazy competitive, and he doesn't know who I am yet...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at Kotetsu for a few moments more...before he burst out laughing. Kotetsu started, the man letting go of his arm. \"N-Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill laughing uproariously, Naruto patted Kotetsu on the back heartily. \"Heh, way to go, kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu's eyes widened. \"You're...you're not mad I beat you?\" he asked before he could stop himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled. \"Well, normally, I probably would be, a little bit, but...\" he grinned, slugging the boy playfully in the shoulder. \"...it's not often I get a competitor who can pack as much ramen away as I can...or who loves it as much as I do. Far as I can tell, you EARNED this win.\" <i>Not to mention, there's something about him that just makes it impossible to be mad at him...but what the hell is it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to Naruto's internal musings, Kotetsu grinned. \"Aww, thanks, Naruto. But ya know,\" the boy continued, rubbing the back of his head. \"...if it weren't for that huge belch ya did...which was AWESOME, by the way...\" Naruto beamed at this. '...you probably woulda won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened: the kid could easily have just been trying to be gracious about his win, but something told him he genuinely believed he'd only won by a hair. \"Yeah, well, that was my fault...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I want you to have the prize money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed. \"Well, that's real nice of yoWHA...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu laughed a bit at Naruto's utterly shocked expression. \"Yeah, I never really entered for the prize money; I only entered 'cause I love ramen.\" <i>That, and I hoped I'd run into you...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" he continued out loud, \"I'm from a really far-away land; this nation's money wouldn't really do me any good back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at the kid, trying to determine if he was working an angle, but no: he was 100% sincere. <i>This kid's something else, ain't he...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, Naruto managed to grin and playfully elbow Kotetsu in the side. \"Well, kiddo, if you insist...\" Kotetsu beamed at this, looking inordinately happy for someone who had just given away a huge cash prize. Naruto, however, simply beamed back, now quite used to the boy's odd behavior. <i>But...why is he so damn familiar...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought ran through his mind even as he bade Kotetsu goodbye, accepted the cash prize from the bemused officiant, and got up from his chair, his huge belly shaking as he did so. Grunting, he turned away, taking waddling, lurching steps as he made his way toward the exit and, obviously, back to his bed at the inn, where he would hopefully spend several hours resting off his massive meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Naruto sighed as he laid on his bed, having long digested the massive amounts of ramen he'd consumed earlier that  day. He had shucked off his jacket and headband, leaving only his orange trousers and black, red flame-patterned t-shirt. As he did, his mind wandered back to the events of the day: of the contest, of the meeting with Kotetsu, of how damn familiar the kid seemed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heck's going on?\" Naruto muttered, scrunching up his brow in concentration. \"I know this is my first time meeting him, but I still feel like I...know him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who the hell could that be, knockin\u2019 at this hour\u2026?\u201d asked Naruto, curiously as he hopped up from his bed and headed for the door.  A little reluctant; due to the hour and simple basic caution, he nonetheless unlocked the door and opened it partially, only for his eyes to widen in surprise when he saw who was behind said door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKotetsu\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu; whom had also digested the ample amount of ramen he had ingested during his contest with Naruto, until his stomach was flat once more, smiled gleefully and rubbed the back of his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya, Naruto!\u201d  Exclaimed the young red head happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching his head a bit, Naruto asked, \u201cErrr, w-what\u2019re ya doin\u2019 here?  How\u2019d you even know where I was stayin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red headed youth\u2019s smile softened a bit and he added, \u201cOh, uh, I did a lil asking around!  The official guy gave me this address, in case they\u2019d hafta mail the reward\u2019er something, heh.  I\u2019m real sorry for dropping in so late, but\u2026it\u2019s just, I didn\u2019t wanna leave with givin\u2019 ya a proper goodbye, sooo\u2026h-here I am, heh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Naruto smiled; admittedly, rather glad to see the kid again, even if he still didn\u2019t know what was really going on, there was no denying that Kotetsu was just an all around pleasant and kind individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t just stand out there in the cold, come on in, kiddo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaming; and notably relieved, Kotetsu nodded and headed right into the inn as Naruto shut the door behind them.  As Naruto mused what to do or say next, Kotetsu\u2019s face suggested some internal turmoil as well, unsure where to begin\u2026to say what he wanted to say\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could, however\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019know, I really wanna to thank you, Kotetsu.  I can\u2019t think of anyone who\u2019d ever be generous enough to just give away such a huge cash prize like that.  I mean\u2026I-I know ya said it was just about wolfin\u2019 down the ramen, heh, believe I do\u2026\u201d Naruto rubbed his thinned stomach hungrily as he chuckled, musing on how wonderful all that ramen tasted.  Then, after a moment, he stopped and; a bit more genuinely, said, \u201cBut even if the cash ain\u2019t no good where you\u2019re from, that was really nice of you, and I just\u2026wanna say thanks.  Thanks for being such awesome competition, for makin\u2019 that final round so much damn fun, and\u2026well\u2026for just being a great kid altogether.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu was a bit taken back, unable to hide an immensely grateful and warm smile from his face, before he rubbed the back of his head and said, \u201cHeh, now you\u2019re just being way too nice, Naruto!  \u2018Sides, you made that last round awesome too!  Ya gave it a million and ten percent!  Plus, you were really nice to me the whole time!  Way nicer than some of the other competitors\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked to himself, recalling some less than pleasant encounters he\u2019d been more than happy to school early on in the competition.  Nevertheless, Kotetsu\u2019s praise had reminded Naruto of what had been nagging at his mind for a good while now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, well, you seemed like a chipper and friendly kid\u2026plus, I\u2026\u201d Naruto stopped midsentence and rubbed his forehead with both palms, sighing in frustration as he tried to word what he wanted to say as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you okay, Naruto?\u201d asked Kotetsu, already having a fair guess at what was bothering Naruto so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Yeah, I\u2026well\u2026I dunno\u2026I just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Naruto decided not to keep to himself for a moment longer.  Sighing again, his hands dropped and he glanced at Kotetsu a bit uncertainly and said, \u201cSomething\u2019s been nagging at the back\u2019uh my head ever since we kicked it off\u2026.like, hangin\u2019 out, talkin\u2019, hell, even EATING all that ramen!  It all\u2026felt so\u2026so\u2026.familiar\u2026and, I don\u2019t know why\u2026why it felt right just chowin\u2019 down together like that, or rufflin\u2019 y\u2019er head, or just\u2026all of it.  As if we\u2019d known each other before.  And what\u2019s buggin\u2019 me more than anything is, I KNOW I\u2019ve never seen your face before, and yet\u2026something in your eyes feels more familiar than anything else\u2026and I just don\u2019t know what\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu squirmed a bit.  <i>How would Naruto react if he knew the truth?  Would he\u2026COULD he...actually remember\u2026?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something else caught Naruto\u2019s eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey, Kotetsu\u2026your pants\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?  W-what\u2019s wrong with my pants, Naruto?\u201d asked Kotetsu, with a slight nervousness beneath his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019tcha bust your button towards the end\u2019uh the final round\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, Kotetsu was kicking himself as he maintained composure and felt the front of his pants, remembering it still looked like the pants he was wearing when they were in the last round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!  Uh, y-yeah!  But, I mean, it\u2019s not like that was the ONLY pair I had like that.  \u2018Sides, I couldn\u2019t spend ALL day wearin\u2019 busted pants, that would look silly!\u201d Kotetsu replied, trying to maintain a calm demeanor as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2026I guess\u2026\u201d replied Naruto.  Naturally, that could have very easily been the reason, but for some odd reason, Naruto wasn\u2019t quite convinced.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Naruto could inquire further, the young red head sighed a bit himself and said, \u201c\u2026The truth is, I\u2026I came here for more than sayin\u2019 goodbye\u2026and I\u2026I entered that contest for more than just eating a buncha ramen\u2026though it was definitely a bonus, heh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow quite curious, Naruto raised an eyebrow and asked, \u201cWhy else would\u2019ja join the contest then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping a bit nervously, Kotetsu worked a bit of nerve and finally, answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026So I could see you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood silently for a moment, processing what the young man had just told him\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Again\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu nodded softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood in silence for but a moment\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What's he...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his thoughts could go any further, the space around 'Kotetsu' erupted into a puff of white smoke, as was the technique's signature. Shaking off his thoughts, Naruto bolted to his feet, getting into a defensive stance should he decide to attack. He narrowed his eyes as he stared into the smoke. <i>Alright, who are---</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, his thoughts ground to a halt as something long and bushy cut through the smoke, waving. <i>What? The hell is...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat object was soon followed by another. Then another, and another, and another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. <i>Wait...are those...tails?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, there were several tails waving about the smoke, each covered in orange fur...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes bulged. <i>W-wait...nine tails, orange fur?! What the...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, before his thoughts could go any further, the being within the smoke cloud whipped its tails about, apparently spinning in place. A gust of wind emanated from the center of it, blowing the smoke away and buffeting Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grunted, holding an arm up to protect himself. <i>Agh!</i> Wincing, he lowered his arm. <i>Well, whoever or whatever 'Kotetsu' is, at least...he's got...style...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts trailed off as he let his arm drop completely...and he gazed as the entity that had been disguised as a human boy rose out of the crouch its twirl had left it in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the being reached its full height,  Naruto noted in teh back of his mind that it was roughly as tall as its Kotetsu disguise had been, and it stood upon two legs...but that was where the similarities ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature before him was covered head to toe in orange fur, save for an area of black fur around his eyes that extended upwards into his rabbit-like ears. It possessed a slender, vulpine muzzle, and its hind legs were shaped like a canine's, with its hand-like paws/hands ending in pointed claws. Its most distinguishing feature, however, were the nine long, bushy tails sticking out of its backside. Set in its head were a pair of red, slitted eyes that nonetheless shone with anxiety. It was, put quite simply, a bipedal nine-tailed fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young one, to be sure; it appeared to be in its preteen years as its disguise had been, as evidenced by its height, and its proportions were roughly like how Naruto remembered his being when he was that age, albeit a bit thinner. However, his arms and legs had some visible definition and muscle, suggesting it kept in shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also wore clothes, though they were quite different from its Kotetsu guise. It wore a red, sleeveless shirt on its upper body, over which was draped an open vest that stopped just above its tails. Curiously, one side was sleeveless, exposing its bare, furry arm that nonetheless had a red band around the wrist. The other side, though, had a long sleeve, concealing his other arm up to its wrist. On its legs and lower body, it wore a pair of baggy orange trousers, a belt looped around the waist. Curiously, it wore nothing over its clawed feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, the fox looked up at Naruto, giving him a nervous, reluctant smile. \"Erm...hi, Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto started; the creature had the exact same voice as Kotetsu had had. But more than that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait,</i> Naruto narrowed his eyes and stared closer at the fox, who winced and took a step back. <i>That's definitely the Nine-Tailed Fox, but he's...different from the one in me. Almost like...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gasped suddenly, and he staggered back as a series of images and sounds slammed into his mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...couldn't be more glad to be hangin' out with ya...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...Mornin', buddy!....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...you're the bestest friend anyone could ever have...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...not gonna let you become a monster, alright?...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...hey there, little buddy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...teach you to sleep with your shirt up!...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young fox stared at Naruto with worry as the boy panted and knelt over, his hands on his knees. <i>Is...is his memory coming back? I-I mean, Hunter's friend said any three of them would probably remember who I was the moment they saw me, but he said he'd never done anything like that before...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes bulged as more images and sounds...<i>memories</i>, he realized...surged forth into his mind. No...more like they were rising up. Like they'd been buried, but were now forcing themselves free...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the memories stopped coming, and Naruto panted as they asserted themselves in his mind: sorting themselves, putting themselves in the right places...and as soon as they finished, everything made sense to Naruto. Slowly, raising his head up, he stared at the young fox, who recoiled slightly...and yet had so much hope in his eyes it was heartbreaking. <i>D-does he...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them said anything for a moment. Then....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Kurama...?\" It was the softest Naruto had ever spoken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as his name left the blonde's mouth, nodded, a small smile coming to his face. \"Y-yeah, it's me,\" he replied, his voice soft even as his eyes began glistening. \"H-how much do you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything,\" Naruto replied, smiling. \"Meeting you as a kit, Hunter, our trip to Termina, everything that happened there....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened, even as his eyes began to noticeably brim with tears. <i>He...he really does remember, just like Mewtwo said he would...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, silence reigned between the two of them, Naruto smiling warmly at Kurama, with the young fox's eyes growing shinier and shinier as his muzzle began trembling....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a great cry, Kurama rushed toward Naruto, extending his arms outward. Naruto barely had time to react before Kurama had wrapped his arms around Naruto's torso, digging his head into his shirt as he sniffled, his body shaking with sobs as tears trickled down his fur. \"I've...I've missed you so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Naruto had about a million questions: how Kurama had come to be in this world again in the first place, why he seemed to have aged when it had only been a few months since the Termina trip...but none of that mattered in this moment. Instead, he looked down at the young fox digging his head into his chest, smiled, and wrapped his own arms around Kurama's torso in a hug. \"Hey, hey, what're you crying for, buddy?\" Naruto asked in a soothing voice. At hearing the word 'buddy', Kurama only cried harder. \"Hey, c'mon, don't cry,\" Naruto urged softly, his own eyes moistening. \"You're happy to see me, arentch'a?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" came Kurama's muffled reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto closed his eyes, tears dripping from them nonetheless. \"That makes two of us.\" He hugged Kurama harder. \"It's so great to see ya again,Kurama. You've shot up like a weed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of his tears,Kurama managed a chuckle. \"Yeah, well, that's what a few years'll do to a growing kit...\" Naruto's eyes widened at this, but disregarded it for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two disengaged their hug, though they still stared at each other with tearful yet joyful smiles on their faces. Once again, neither one of them said anything, instead opting to enjoy a companionable silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after a few long, happy moments...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kurama wiped his still tear soaked eyes with his forearm and smiled the warmest smile; kit or human, could flash another being.  \"H-heh...sorry, I...I had to try so hard not to do that as soon as I saw ya at the table...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled an equally warm smile as he wiped his own tear soaked eyes, then reached over and ruffled the top of Kurama's fuzzy orange head assuredly yet playfully, earning a soft chuckle from the young fox, still too overwhelmed to properly speak.  Kurama on the other hand, flashed a slightly apologetic glance Naruto's way and added, \"...B-by the way, I...I knew it was buggin' you ever since I showed up in my disguise, and I just...I'm sorry I couldn't tell ya then and there.  Believe me, I wanted to, I wanted to so badly...but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kurama could finish, Naruto smiled assuredly and pat the fox on the shoulder.  \"You have nothing to apologize for.  I don't care about all that, I'm just...so damn happy to see you, kiddo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, a few more tears trickled down Naruto's face once those words had left his mouth.  It was all so much still sinking in.  Kurama; naturally, caught that and just smiled back, feeling himself getting slightly choked up again.  \"Me too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as Naruto attempted to regain composure, something else had entered his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, those couple'uh years...\" Naruto began, raising an eyebrow of genuine curiosity, which caught Kurama's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Right!  Heh, yeah, guess I oughta explain that one a lil bit,\" he said with a chuckle as he rubbed the back of his head sheepishly.  \"Remember when Hunter said he'd take me to a different dimension where I could live my life and not be alone?\"  To which, Naruto nodded, mind still just slightly hazed on all the specifics, though those little details would resurface in no time at all.  \"Well, apparently, what I didn't know was not all dimensions follow the same kinda timeline...er...time...span...thingies...as each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Naruto scratched his head in slight confusion.  Dense as he may have had a tendency to be from time to time, math and science often flew over his head...particularly when it came to different time \"thingies\" as his fuzzy friend had just put it.  Nonetheless, he eventually tilted his head in thought, until his face lit up, putting two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, yeaaaaah...now that'cha mention it,\" Naruto began, confusion beginning to fade as he continued with a bit more certainty, \"unless I'm rememberin' wrong, it's only been a few months since our trip to Termina!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy to see Naruto able to follow along, Kurama beamed and added, \"Yep!  That's why you don't look much older at all since we last saw each other, whereas for me?  It's been like, a few years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked.  \"Damn...who knows...a few months later, you might be able to call ME kiddo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, it was kind of a bittersweet realization.  Kurama seemed to getting along just fine and Naruto couldn't be happier for his young friend, but at the same time...to grow up so fast; for Naruto at least, seemed as though he'd almost been left behind to some extent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he shook that off and smiled full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter how fast Kurama's new home moved as far as time was concerned in comparison to Naruto's world.  It didn't even matter that Naruto wouldn't be able to see his friend grow or be able to guide him like he'd been able to in their past.  The only thing that mattered was that his young fox friend was free to live his new life, and above all else...be happy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Naruto's smile grew a bit more mischievous.  \"Still...\" he started, earning a curious glance from Kurama, \"...you may not be as small as you were as a kit...but you ARE shorter than me for the time being...which means...I can do THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before Kurama had a remote chance to react, Naruto reached over and snatched the young Tailed-Beast, pulling him close under his arm and ruffling the top of his head like a light noogie.  \"Ahhhahaha!  No fair!\" laughed Naruto as he squirmed playfully swatting at Naruto's arm.  Naruto couldn't help but laugh right alongside the fox as he continued; the two laughing uproariously for a good while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the noogie turned into a playful ruffling and the light 'headlock' the blonde seemed to have the fox in turned into another embrace as this time, Naruto pulled Kurama into his torso and wrapped his arms around his back and neck while Kurama; despite himself, eagerly wrapped his arms around Naruto's torso and once again, leaned his head against the elder teen's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't care how big you get, Kurama...no matter what, you're always gonna be my buddy...big or lil...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama simply smiled, snuggling his head deeper against Naruto's chest and squinting his eyes shut, until a just slightly impish grin formed over the young fox's muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee...weeeeeeell, you never know...if I'm ever taller than you, I might be the one givin' ya noogies...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed softly as he just pat the fox on the back, and after a moment had passed, lightly disengaged their embrace as Naruto smirked and rubbed the back of his head at the notion of Kurama getting bigger as he got older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, if you ever get that big around me, we might be able to do a bit'uh trainin' together.  Seems like you're keepin' in shape, afterall, which reminds me...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What've you been up to in your new home?\" Naruto asked the young fox. \"I mean...\" He screwed up his brow, concentrating as a few more fuzzy memories became clear. \"...Hunter said he was taking you to someplace with...fairy tales, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled, blushing and rubbing the back of his head. \"Heh heh; actually, it was a land called Fiore with a wizard's guild <i>called</i> Fairy Tail.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. \"Wizards...? Guilds...?\" The young fox nodded eagerly. \"And... and the guild is called... Fairy Tale?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned. \"Yep! Fairy Tail!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Kyubi's eyes glinted. \"Ya know, 'tail', as in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without warning, Kurama fell forward, landing in a crouch on all fours. Naruto raised an eyebrow. \"Uh, Kurama? What're you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama said nothing, but smirked...and suddenly flared his tails up in back of him, bunching them together. Naruto's eyes widened as it clicked. \"Ohhhh, I get it!\" the blonde exclaimed, beaming. \"Fairy TAIL!\" Kurama beamed in return, even as he motioned toward his tails with his head. \"Yeah, for a second there, I thought...\" Unconsciously, he followed where Kurama was indicating...and his smile quickly became a puzzled frown as he saw something strange drawn on the bunched-together tails. \"Huh? Kurama, what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'that' in question was a rather oddly-shaped symbol that appeared to be some sort of odd bird-looking creature, with what looked like a straight leg in front of it, with a waving \"tail\" in back of it. It was colored a bright red, which actually contrasted rather nicely with his orange fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Naruto's question, Kurama grinned fiercely, a glint of undeniable pride in his expression. \"That,\" he began, standing back up on his hind legs and letting his tails down again, \"is my Guild Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Guild Mark?\" Naruto asked, completely lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned even more fiercely. \"Yep! It's what shows the world...\" He jabbed a thumb toward himself. \"...that I'm a Fairy Tail wizard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened. \"A...wizard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama folded his arms, smirking. \"Yep! A wizard! We hang out, take jobs that can range from doing community work to takin' out monsters... I especially like the ones that take me to far-off places, 'cause I love traveling... and learn as much as we can about magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last part caught Naruto's attention. \"...magic?\" Naruto tilted his head. Like, jutsu or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama chuckled. \"Eh, kinda, but its different.\" His grin became enthusiastic, unfolding his arms and stepping toward Naruto. \"Here, lemme show ya.\" Stopping a few feet from Naruto, he held one of his hands palm-up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised an eyebrow. \"Huh? Kurama, what're you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without warning, a small flame erupted from the young fox's palm, flaring into existence and burning steadily above...no, directly out of his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAGH!\" Naruto yelped, jumping back. \"Th-the hell is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kurama closed his palm, extinguishing the fire. \"That,\" Kurama began, laughing, \"was just a little bit of fire magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared, wide-eyed. It was far from the most impressive display of \"firepower\" he'd ever witnessed; there had been his battle with Sasuke a few years back at the Valley of the End, where they'd both gone all out-Naruto quickly quashed that thought, since thinking about that always made him upset, and now wasn't the time to be upset-but the fact that he had done it without any hand signs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire magic...\" Naruto muttered, staring at Kurama. \"You actually learned how to do magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama shrugged. \"Yeah, a bit,\" he admitted. \"I mean, nothin' huge; I'm nowhere near as good as Natsu, or Erza, or any of those guys...\" At Naruto's utterly flabbergasted expression, he chuckled a bit sheepishly. \"Eh, those are just a couple of the friends I've made at the guild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Naruto brightened. \"Friends?\" Naruto repeated, smiling. \"You made a lot of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's expression brightened considerably. \"Oh yeah, a lot of them!\" he exclaimed excitedly. \"Everyone there's really, really nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tone softened, though the smile never left his face. \"I mean..when I first got there a few years ago, for me at least, I was so scared, so worried about what they'd be like, whether they'd be scared...\" He looked back up at Naruto. \"B-but they all welcomed me, no questions asked! They made me feel at home, l-like I was one of them...\" He laughed, scratching his cheek. \"It-it didn't take long for me to find my place there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, closing his eyes as he smiled and his heart swelled. He figured Kurama had been doing well, but to hear he was surrounded by such welcoming folks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-man, Kurama,\" Naruto replied, looking up and opening his eyes. \"I'm-I'm really glad you'vEHHHHHH?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama frowned tilting his head. \"Huh? What's wrong, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gaped, eyes wide. \"Your-your clothes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eye brow raised. \"Huh?\" He started to glance down. \"What about my...\" His eyes flew wide open as he looked down at his body. Somehow, all of his clothes had migrated from his body to a pile on the floor beside him; the only thing he was wearing was a pair of orange boxers with several stylized flame patterns streaking throughout it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH!\" Kurama exclaimed, jumping back and blushing red as a tomato. \"Damn it, not again!\" Flushing even redder beneath his orange fur, he stooped down to the ground and hastily began pulling his clothes back on. It wasn't until he'd managed to slip his pants back on that Naruto had managed to find his voice. \"Kurama, what...what the hell was that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing his belt, Kurama turned toward Naruto, an absolutely mortified expression on his face. \"S-sorry about that, Naruto,\" the young creature apologized, looping it around his waist and pulling it tight. \"It's just, uh, one of my friends at the Guild-Gray-sorta has this bad habit of taking his clothes off at really inappropriate times without even realizing it.\" He grabbed his sleeveless red shirt and slipped it over his head, grabbing his one-sleeved vest and pulling it on over the shirt. \"And I guess, well...\" He laughed nervously, grabbing his wristband and slipping it over his bare arm. \"It sorta rubbed off on me a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...takes his clothes off?\" Naruto repeated, flabbergasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama pulled at his collar. \"Yyyyyeah,\" the young fox replied, nodding. \"Everyone at the guild's...a little quirky....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little...?\" Naruto deadpanned, not quite able to believe what he was hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama winced at Naruto's tone. \"Y-yeah, things can be a little...weird,\" he admitted. \"I mean, sometimes Natsu breaks into Lucy's apartment with some of the others, and Cana drinks more than any human being should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Naruto's increasingly dumbfounded expression, Kurama gulped. \"B-but they're still really nice, and they're really good friends...\" In an attempt to dispel Naruto's expression, he smiled awkwardly. \"Besides, Hunter was kinda weird, and he was one of the nicest guys-er, wolves-I've ever met! That's gotta count for something, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's expression softened as he thought about what Kurama had just said. \"Y-yeah, I guess so...\" Naruto admitted. Then, in spite of himself, he smiled, walked up to Kurama, and threw his arm around Kurama's neck, pulling him close and eliciting a round of playful protests from him. \"Just so long as they're treating you good, I'm satisfied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama said nothing, but beamed up at Naruto. \"Oh yeah, they've been treating me really good! Natsu, Gray, Erza, Lucy...they're all really great friends.\" Then, even with Naruto's arm still about his shoulders, he hugged Naruto from the side. \"Still, you're always gonna be my best friend, Naruto, no matter where I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled, his heart once again swelling. \"Aw, thanks, little buddy.\" He repositioned his arm in a tight one-armed hug  around the young fox. \"Well, maybe not so little anymore, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK,\" Kurama replied, laughing. \"I know I'm still shorter than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. \"Yeah, some things never change. Which reminds me...\" His simle grew absolutely devilish. \"...are you still ticklish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blinked at the odd question. \"Am I still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scarcely had time to react before Naruto tackled him to the flor, pinning his lower body down with his knees. \"Naruto, what are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened as Naruto, grinning evilly, reached to the bottom of his shirt and pulled it up, revealing his orange-furred tummy. \"W-wait, Naruto, don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCackling, Naruto extended his hands toward the young creature's furry belly, and as soon as his fingers made contact, he began fluttering them across the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" Kurama practically shrieked, wriggling as hard as he could. \"C-come on, lay oHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the harder Kurama struggled, the more Naruto tickled him, and the louder Kurama's laughter rang out. In the back of his mind, Naruto smiled. <i>Just like old times...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Kurama breathed heavily, still giggling uncontrollably as he wiped tears of laughter from his eyes, he hadn't noticed that devilish smile still across Naruto's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooooo...now that we know you're still ticklish...lemme ask you ANOTHER question...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's pupils dilated.  \"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember how you used to sleep as a kit sometimes?

Then, another thought came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Naruto, two of Kurama's tails had now risen right into Naruto's armpits, and before he could even surmise the situation, they began fluttering relentlessly.  Within a nanosecond, Naruto stopped tickling Kurama's tummy mid tickle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly HIS eyes widened, and within a matter of milliseconds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!!\" squealed the blonde as he suddenly began squirming and promptly fell to his back, desperately trying to swat at Kurama's tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning a rather mischievous and toothy grin himself, Kurama rose to his feet and stared down at his buddy as his other tails began to flutter eagerly behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another lil trick I picked up at the guild...\" Kurama remarked as he grabbed the bottom of Naruto's shirt and pulled it up, exposing Naruto's bare stomach.  \"Time for some payback, buddy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as Naruto laughed and laughed, he resisted in vein to stop what was coming next.  \"Ehehehe, n-now Kurahahahama, l-let's beeeheeheeeheee r-r-reasonaBAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHHAHAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late, Kurama's remaining tails had already begun fluttering all across Naruto's bare belly, making the teen laugh hysterically as Kurama's grin grew wider and wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right, Naruto.  Some things never EVER change!\" chuckled Kurama, as he continued the tickling frenzy at a relentless rate, as Naruto tried desperately to swat the many fluffy tails away, none which did any good as he often found himself recoiling from sheer reflex and hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil finally, he gave up on resisting, and instead, quickly reached over and resumed tickling Kurama's orange-furred tummy some more, causing him to laugh uncontrollably yet again as he continued doing the same to Naruto, leaving them both incoherent with laughter as they tickled one another for a good while until they both eventually fell to the ground side by side, disengaging from each other, chuckling relentlessly and eventually wiping tears of laughter from their faces as the young man and younger fox simply laid on the ground, chuckling and breathing heavily to cach their breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two shared a glanced, and immediately burst into a fit of laughter, clutching at their sides at the ridiculousness that had just transpired.  \"Ohhohoho, man, I've missed this!\" laughed Kurama as he wiped some more tears of laughter from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhehehe...man, that felt good!\" remarked Naruto as he playfully nudged his buddy in the side and added, \"Just like old times, right?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama beamed at this and nodded eagerly.  \"You said it, pal!  Heck, it almost reminds me of that one time we asked Hunter to play with you, me, Kiba'n Akamaru, and he just started tickling every last one of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeaaaaah!  Back at North Clock Town, right?  Where that slide was?  Hehe, wherever he is now, I hope he ain't gettin' into TOO much trouble, cause man, that wolf was all kinds'uh crazy sometimes, wasn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, yep!  He sure was!  But I didn't care, cause he was always so nice and caring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <i>fun.</i>  My memories might still be trying to connect all the tinier dots, but one thing I remember with absolute certainty, was never ever being bored around him.  And like ya said, he was a real stand up fella.  I never met anyone who'd go that far out of their way to help people and make 'em happy the way he did for us.\"  He then glanced back at Kurama, and after some chuckling, smiled warmly at his young friend and added, \"Plus, if it weren't for him, we wouldn't have ever 'really' met...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama nodded at that realization, then; a bit more distantly, recalled all that transpired before and after their first meeting; the memories of his cage...what he could have become were all too vivid for the young creature, recalling when he realized the truth of what he could have become, and dreading it in its' entirety.  \"Yeah...\" Kurama replied, simply and softly, catching Naruto's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, buddy?\" asked Naruto, light hearted but sensing something on his friends mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...I keep thinking back to those days.  When you saw me scared and alone in my cage, and promised me I'd never be alone, or promised me that you wouldn't let me turn into...that monster...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto recalled that tragic image of a previously much MUCH larger kit behind the bars of that larger red cage...alone and scared, and nodded softly to himself.  \"When I first saw you as a kit, I...remembered back when I was a kid...feeling alone...scared...and...never having anyone to talk to or make that hurt go away, and never truly knowing why.  I didn't want you to go through that either.  And, when you found out what you were...ORIGINALLY going to grow up into, I couldn't let it happen anymore.  I damn sure wasn't about to lose you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you felt bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Naruto shook his head softly and smiled a warm, genuine smile at the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I never abandon my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling himself get a little misty eyed yet again, Kurama; quickly blinked those tears away and smiled warmly right back at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if I say it a million times...thank you, Naruto...thank you for everything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smiling, Naruto didn't respond verbally.  Rather, he wrapped his arm around the fox's shoulders and pulled him close, rocking him lightly and playfully, earning a soft chuckle from Kurama as the two sat for a good long moment, until finally, Naruto sighed happily and said, \"...It's good to have you back, buddy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another moment...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>GRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWLLLLL......</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened at the sudden, rumbling noise coming from his fox buddy. Kurama, on the other hand, simply blushed like a madman (or madfox) and wrapped his arms around his midsection. \"Heh; little hungry there, Kurama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill blushing, Kurama glanced over at Naruto. \"Erm...yeah,\" he admitted, chuckling nervously and rubbing the back of his head. \"Guess it's been a little while since the ramen contest, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed, patting his young friend on the back. \"Eh, yeah, it's late at night; no reason to get embarrassed about it.\" His own stomach rumbled, and he rubbed it through his black shirt. \"Come to think of it, I could probably go for something to eat, too...\" He turned to the young fox, arm still draped about his shoulders. \"You, uh, know if this village has any places open late? I mean, I've been here a couple days, but, uh, I was mostly focused on the contest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned, even as his stomach let out another noisy growl. \"Oh, you bet! I actually spent a day or two in this village before the contest, just in case, ya know...\" He blushed a bit. \"...just in case you arrived early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's heart swelled just a little bit at that. Kurama had gotten to the village early just on the off chance he'd run into him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting that thought aside for the moment (though not out of disinterest; his stomach simply wished to make itself a higher priority at that moment), he beamed at the young fox. \"Really? What kinda stuff do they got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the question, Kurama's eyes lit up. \"Oh, they've got all kindsa stuff!\" He held a hand up and ticked each item off on a digit. \"They've got a pizza place, a tempura place, a bakery, a deli...\" He beamed as he held up one final digit. \"...and they even have an ice cream place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised an eyebrow. \"Really? Didn't think a village this size would have that many places to eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama shrugged. \"Eh, maybe, but those places are how the village makes a lot of its money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at his friend, confused. \"How do you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smirked, twitching his rather large ears. \"I kept an ear out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared dumbly at Kurama for a moment before he laughed, playfully tweaking the young Nine-Tails' ears, much to his delight. \"Heh; shoulda known.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling in spite of himself, Kurama playfully batted Naruto's hand away from his ears. \"Heehee, so, whaddaya wanna get?\" He thought for a moment. \"You want me to put on my disguise?\" To emphasize this, he formed the hand sign for the Transformation Jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, Naruto shook his head. \"Disguise yourself just after we've met each other again?\" the blonde began, smirking. \"Nope.\" The smirk quickly became a grin. \"Nah, I was thinkin' you'd stay in your real form for this one; wouldn't be like old times if you changed your appearance, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama tilted his head. \"But...if I go out in public like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chucklled, ruffling his young buddy's head fur. \"That's why you're NOT gonna go out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blinked quizzically. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Naruto continued. \"Tell me, Kurama: do any of those places do takeout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit surprised at the question, Kurama nonetheless nodded. \"Y-yeah, all of those places do takeout, but I'm not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears shot up as a light bulb went off in his head. <i>Ohhhhhhh.....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that the young creature had gotten his drift, Naruto pressed on. \"Yep, way I was thinking, I'd head out, hit up those places, and use summa the prize money you gave me-thanks again, by the way-\" Kurama beamed widely at this, squinting his eyes shut. \"-to buy us a feast, then bring everything back here and eat 'till we can't feel our feet anymore.\" Naruto winked at the young Tailed Beast. \"Sound good?\" If Kurama's huge, toothy grin wasn't a resounding \"yes\", then the huge rumble that ripped forth from his stomach certainly was. Naruto chuckled. \"That's what I thought.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing off to a corner of the room, he grabbed his sandals and plopped down on the bed to pull them on. \"Alright, Kurama, you got anything you feel like in particular?\" He set his remaining sandal beside him on the bed and patted his belly as it let out another growl. \"Me, I'm so hungry, I don't really care what we get...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama looked toward the ceiling, deep in thought. \"Hmmm....\" He looked back at Naruto. \"Um, maybe some large pizzas-meat lovers, if ya don't mind-,  some seafood tempura, some cakes and muffins, some chicken, and, um...\" He stuck his tongue out the side of his muzzle as he tried to think of what he wanted from the ice cream place. \"Um...ah gee, this is a tough one...Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes glinted. \"How about every single flavor they got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes shot wide open at this, and a huge grin spread across his face. \"Sounds good!\" He licked his lips. \"And, uh, if you don't mind, maybe pick up some sundae fixings...\" As he said this, he got a sort of faraway look in his eyes, and a warm smile came to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled an equally warm smile at this, knowing full well what his buddy was thinking of. \"Well, Kurama,\" he began, scratching his cheek, \"I can't promise that it'll be as epic as when Hunter helped us make that gigantic sundae...\" he winked at his friend. \"...but yeah, I can totally pick up some sundae fixings!\" His heart once again swelled as he saw the immensely grateful smile on Kurama's face. Shaking it off with a chuckle, he pulled his other sandal on and fastened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama licked his lips, thinking of all the delightful treats he and Naruto would soon be downing...but a thought suddenly occurred to him. \"Wait,\" he began, frowning. \"How are ya gonna carry all that by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping to his feet, Naruto turned toward Kurama and grinned. \"Like this.\" He made a hand sign, and, in several dozen puffs of smoke, as many duplicates of Naruto appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's face lit up. \"Oooh, the Shadow Clone Jutsu!\" Kurama exclaimed. \"I remember that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto (the original) grinned and rubbed the back of his head. \"Heh, yeah; really comes in handy, ya know?\" Walking toward the door, he opened it and turned back toward Kurama. \"You, uh, gonna be OK here by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama winked. \"Eh, don't worry about me. I can find ways to keep myself occupied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled. \"Well, if you're sure...\" At Kurama's nod, Naruto nodded back and headed out the door, followed by his several dozen Shadow Clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the last Shadow Clone had left and closed the door, Kurama got to his feet, walked over to the bed, and plopped down on it. \"Ooh, this bed's pretty bouncy...\" he mused. Shaking that thought off for the time being, he closed his eyes, concentrated, and, in a flash of light, summoned a decently-sized book. Opening his eyes, he grinned widely. \"Ah, Requip magic; never fails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling into a comfortable sitting position on the bed, he leafed through the book until he found the page he'd last dog-eared, and began reading....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some ample time had passed since Naruto and his posse of shadow clones had made their way through the village in order to pick up the many delights both Naruto and Kurama would be dining on soon enough.  Back at the inn, however, young Kurama was quite enveloped in his literature, reading softly to himself as his eyes quickly darted from left to right; eyes wide with enchantment and the corners of his mouth risen just slightly enough to be considered a smile.  Seemed whatever the young fox was reading had him quite engaged.  So much so, that it was almost enough to make the young fox forget how immensely hungry he was...though the occasional roar from his stomach would remind him all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPage after page, Kurama seemed ever more eager to delve deeper into his novel, until he jerked back slightly, causing himself to bounce just slightly from the bed springs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooooooow...\" the young Tailed-Beast exclaimed, \"...I didn't see THAT comin' at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he stopped for a moment, and glanced slightly to his hand / paw, now resting by his side on the bed, bouncing just a bit more, earning a slight snicker from the fox.  \"Heehee...guess this bed really IS bouncy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if an idea was forming in his young fuzzy head, Kurama's eyes darted left and right as he started patting the mattress some more, feeling his paw bounce about more and more.  \"...I wonder if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kurama stopped and shook his head, immediately grabbing his book and repositioning himself into a sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!  Nope!  Uh-uh!  I'm a part of Fairy Tail now!\" He told himself assertively.  \"I-I can't be doin' stuff like that!  T-that's for babies!  And I'm no baby!  Nope!  No sir!\"  He nodded to himself firmly and promptly turned his attention back to his novel, even going as far as to hum nonchalantly to himself as he did so.  However, the more he read, the more his body started shaking with excitement, thus causing him to draw the book closer to his face until he was practically wearing it over his muzzle; twitching more and more eagerly until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrrrrgghhooookay maybe for a few seconds...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd immediately, the young fox dog eared his current page and clamped his book shut.  Setting it off the bed for just a moment, an especially mischievous expression grew over his face as he promptly climbed atop the bed and steadily rose to his hind legs...and then, after taking a deep breath, he hopped up in the air, landing back down onto the springy mattress, and shot right back into the air again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama chuckled softly, as though suppressing a full-on giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hehe...that was...pretty fun...\" he muttered softly to himself, before hopping again, with the same result.  Only, his smile grew ever wider and his chuckle, with a stronger sense of amusement, growing harder and harder to mask as he hopped a third time.  And then a forth, and even a fifth, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WEEEEEEEEEEE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young fox cheered merrily as he found himself hopping up and down on the bed; bouncing in the air and  kicking himself right back up again and again each time he made contact with the mattress.  With each passing jump, he found himself getting higher and higher, to the point where he was now waving his arms merrily like a toddler each time he found himself high in the air.  He squinted his eyes shut and giggled with childlike glee with each and every bounce, having the absolute time of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to him, however, he WAS bouncing closer and closer to the edge of the bed, but was simply having far too much fun to notice, until finally, with one last hearty yip, he hopped higher than ever onto the bed and bounced upward, higher than ever before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUMP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo high in fact, that the young fox had accidentally smacked his head square into the roof, and plummeted straight down to the floor, landing flat on his rump.  Yelping, Kurama slouched forward, clutching his head in pain; despite his backside faring none too better, and groaned with a mixture of pain and being dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh man, that smarts...\" groaned Kurama, still squinting with discomfort as his long ears folded down just a bit.  Still rubbing the top of his head tenderly, he slowly rose up to his feet, chuckling a bit sheepishly to himself.  \"M-maybe this bed might be a lil...TOO bouncy, h-heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his head still tender but otherwise, no worse for the ware, Kurama leaned down and picked up his book, as he sat back down onto the bed; wincing in pain a bit as his still tender backside made contact with the mattress, and opened his book to the page he'd left off on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well...good.  That was...kinda fun...but, better ya got it outta y'er system before Naruto could see...\"  Once again nodding to himself firmly and assertively, Kurama read his book for just a few more seconds, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, the hell withit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again snapping his book shut, he set it aside and immediately climbed back onto the bed with a wide, toothy smile on his face before he proceeded to hop up and down on the mattress and giggling merrily the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto smiled, even as he approached the door to his room, his arms (and those of the Shadow clones behind him) laden with tubs of ice cream, pizza boxes, containers of tempura, and various other goodies. <i>Ah man,</i> he thought, maneuvering his arms so his hands were sticking out and he was still holding the treats. <i>This is gonna be awesome! Me 'n Kurama, stuffing our faces, havin' a blast...</i> he beamed, struggling to het his hand around the doorknob. <i>It'll be just like old times!</i> He gave a grunt of triumph as he finally got a good grip on the doorknob, but as he started to turn it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. \"What?\" He could hear something coming from his room, but he couldn't quite make out what it was. Curious, he strained his ears. <i>Wait...that sounds like...giggling?</i>  It was Kurama's voice, no doubt about that. But what was he giggling about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked, turning the doorknob the rest of the way. {i|}Eh, well, it sounds like he's havin' fun. Chuckling a bit himself, he gripped the doorknob, stepped back and pulled the door open...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd gaped as he saw Kurama bouncing up and down on his bed. The young fox's eyes were squeezed shut, a huge grin on his muzzle as he waved his arms about and giggled like a child half his age. Naruto blinked slowly as he took the sight in. <i>Well. That's...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled warmly. <i>That's damn adorable.</i> Inwardly, he felt a surge of relief; his buddy may have matured a bit, but it was good to see he wasn't afraid to act like a kid...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smiling, he quietly made his way into the room. Grinning at the fox, he exclaimed, \"Hey, Kurama, I'm back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama's eyes snapped open, and his muzzle dropped wide open as he set eyes on Naruto. \"N-Naru---?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis moment of distraction, unfortunately, caused him to misjudge his bounce...and he hit his head on the ceiling. Yelping, Kurama's arms flew to his head, even as his rump plopped down onto the bed. He winced as he landed on his tails, but couldn't help but breath a sigh of relief. <i>Well, least I didn't hit the floor that time...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his mind reminded him WHAT had caused that pain, and his eyes snapped right back open as he stared at the blonde, who was trying (and failing) to hide his grin. The fox blushed deep crimson beneath his fur. \"H-hi, Naruto!\" Kurama stammered. \"I, was just, uh, ya know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...bein' a kid?\" Naruto supplied, unable to hide a snicker. Kurama flushed even redder at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry,\" Kurama mumbled, head down and ears burning. \"I-I mean, I was just readin', and I felt how bouncy the bed was, and-and I just couldn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed, startling the young fox. \"Ah, you don't hafta be sorry, Kurama,\" the blonde assured him. \"You were just having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama looked, up, blinking a bit. \"You...you don't think I was bein' a baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tilted his head. \"Why would you think that?\" he asked teasingly, but with a hint of genuine curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama gulped. \"Well...\" He scratched the back of his head nervously. \"It-it's just that I'm a little older than when you last saw me, and-and I'm a member of a wizard guild now...one of the most famous guilds in all of Fiore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised an eyebrow at the unfamiliar name, but shook it off. \"Yeah, but you're still a kid; no problem with acting like it. Besides,\" he added, smirking, \"You said the guild was fun, right? I bet a lotta them woulda been right there with ya.\" He smiled warmly. \"I know I woulda been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened, even as he smiled. <i>Well, I guess that's true...I know Natsu woulda been right there with me...and Happy...heck, maybe even Wendy woulda been willing to join in...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut loud, all he said was, \"...thanks, Naruto.\" He beamed, squinting his eyes shut. Naruto's heart once again swelled at this sight; for all that Kurama had grown and matured, even if only a little bit, he was still very much the same happy fox kit he'd last seen a few months back (at least in his own world's time).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought was suddenly brought to a halt as his arms buckled a bit under the treats he was carrying. \"U-uh, not to rush ya, Kurama,\" Naruto grunted, \"but would you mind maybe helpin' me and...the other me's with the goodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blushed, laughing nervously. \"Oh, yeah; sorry about that.\" He hopped to his feet, darted over to Naruto, and helped guide him over to the room's kitchen area. Once there, he helped Naruto set the various goodies on the counter and table. Once that was done, Naruto called a Shadow Clone in, bearing just as much as he had. Once again, Kurama helped set everything down, practically salivating at all the different goodies and scents that were emanating from them. Then, Naruto called in the next Clone, then the next, then the next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the clones were dispersed, and Naruto and Kurama stood surverying the goodies that had been arrayed on the counters and table. There were several stacks of pizza boxes, each at least a dozen high, multiple buckets of chicken (each of which had to constitute at least three whole chickens each), countless containers of various kinds of tempura, several cakes and massive platters of muffins, and, of course, dozens upon dozens of tubs of ice cream, complete with containers of whipped cream, hot fudge, chocolate sauce, sprinkles, cherries, and anything else that could be put onto a sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, even as he wiped his mouth to keep from salivating, glanced down to see Kurama beaming, a huge grin on his face. \"Well, buddy?\" Naruto asked, ruffling his friend's head. \"Whaddaya think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama licked his chops. \"It...it all looks so amazing!\" he exclaimed. \"I-I dunno where to start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled, elbowing Kurama lightly. \"Well, lemme help narrow it down. You wanna start with the regular food, or you wanna have some dessert first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama folded his arms, closing his eyes as though deep in thought. Then, after a few moments, he opened his eyes, looked at Naruto, and said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was thinkin' the same thing,\" replied Naruto, causing Kurama to beam up at the boy before both their stomachs in unison began to rumble hungrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeeeeell, I dunno bout'chu, but I'm ready to redefine the phrase 'chow down,'\" joked Naruto as he pulled a seat at the table for Kurama right next to his, just like at the ramen eating contest.  Smiling gratefully at the boy, the young fox sat down and examined all the goodies Naruto and his shadow clones had picked up across the village.  Taking a big hearty whiff, Kurama practically began to salivate...while Naruto was quite literally salivating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding his arms out towards everything they'd picked up, Naruto turned to his young pal and said, \"Time to dig in, buddy!  Oh, and in case y'er thirsty...\" Naruto pulled a few pizza boxes aside, revealing several liters of cola, causing Kurama's eyes to widen eagerly.  \"Ooooh, soda!\" the young fox remarked, smacking his chops eagerly as Naruto smirked and nodded.  \"Yep.  Sure, it probably won't taste as ultra sweet as Anju's did back when we were all kicking back in Termina...buuuuuuuuuuut it's still pretty damn good.\"  Kurama giggled to himself, recalling just how utterly sweet a beverage Anju's homemade cola truly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee, yeah, Ms. Anju made some really super sweet cola!  Then again, she was a really super sweet lady!\"  Kurama remarked, earning a laugh from Naruto as he playfully nudged the young fox's arm and added, \"Haha, remember all the crap dog-breath kept givin' ya about havin' a thing for her?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama chuckled a bit sheepishly as he rubbed the back of his head, blushing slightly beneath his orange fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh, yeaaah...still, they were both really great guys...err...guys and dogs, heehee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, his ears twitched as he thought back to Kiba and Akamaru and the time they'd all spent together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to think of it, how have Kiba and Akamaru been these days?\" Kurama asked, eager and curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uhhh, things've been good...great, actually!  H-heh, it's funny, cause, even though we didn't have our memories....the three of us became really tight ever since Termina.  Like, we went on way more missions together, trained a lot more together....ATE a lot more together,\" at that, Kurama giggled, recalling Kiba stuffed to his gills and resting on Akamaru; who was always complaining about looking like he was pregnant with quadruplets.  Oblivious to this, Naruto simply continued.  \"...And, we just...kinda started hangin' out a lot more....and NONE of us knew why!  Heh, guess, everything we did, with Hunter, with you, all we'd been through...guess something like that can't just be wiped away, huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama nodded, smiling warmly at his friend.  \"Yeah, plus, they were both really caring, even if Kiba pretended not to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Naruto just snorted and chuckled, nodding in agreement, recalling all the times he and Kiba had given each other crap, bickered, or even gotten into fights.  Yet, through it all, they both genuinely cared for each other, and always had each others backs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeaaaah, he might be an ass, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-he's still your friend.\" finished Kurama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled softly, nodding as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they now?\" asked Kurama curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was actually gonna ask 'em to tag along for this ramen eating contest, but they're both out on a mission with their team.  Sooooo, just us, lil buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama smiled sincerely and said, \"...And nothin' beats spendin' quality time with my best friend in the whole wide world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to help himself, Naruto just wrapped an arm around the fox's shoulders and tugged him close, patting him on the arm brotherly while Kurama squinted his eyes happily at his friend.  \"Right back at'cha, buddy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if a reluctant reminder, once again, both their stomachs roared impatiently in unison, causing them both to flush a bit with embarrassment, before chuckling and disengaging, to focus on the meal at hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two promptly gathered a massive quantity of practically every meal present on the table, each grabbing one liter each and setting it by their completely stacked plates as they got ready to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, both the young man and younger fox turned to each other and grinned toothily at one another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready for a FEAST, kiddo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two smacked their chops and just gaped in astonishment at how much had actually been stacked on their plates.  \"Where to begin, where-to-begin...\" muttered Naruto, before turning to Kurama and asking, \"Where do ya thing we should-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could even finish, Kurama just saved face and began wolfing down whatever his paws could get a hold of, chomping away at various mouthfuls of tempura and chicken, beaming merrily all the while.  \"Smart thinkin'...\" replied Naruto before turning to his plate and mercilessly tearing right into whatever his hands could get a hold of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin no time at all, the two were digging right into their massive piles of food with no signs of hitting the breaks anytime soon...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time ticked by as Naruto and Kurama tore into their utterly stacked plates, grabbing whatever they could find and eagerly gulping it down. They went rather quickly, bits of food flying everywhere, but not out of any desire to beat the other. No, there was a far simpler reason for their speed....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mmmm,</i> Naruto thought, gulping down the last of a slice of cheese pizza and licking his lips to get the sauce off before diving back in. <i>I can see why the village makes most of its money off of food; this stuff's amazing!</i> As though to punctuate this point, he grabbed a drumstick, lifted it to his mouth, and took a huge bite. <i> Oh man...the skin's so crispy...and the chicken! So damn moist...</i> Eyes lighting up, he polished off the drumstick in a few more huge bites, discarding the bone before grabbing a fistful of tempura and cramming it into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kurama was tackling several slices of meat lover's pizza, eating his way up from the bottom of each slice and not stopping until he'd eaten the crust. His cheeks full, he chewed eagerly, even as he grabbed another slice. <i>Wow,</i> the young fox thought eagerly as he swallowed his current slice, only to immediately start devouring his next one. <i>I thought this village's RAMEN was good, but the pizza...it's like a flavor of explosion in every bite!</i> Squinting his eyes shut happily, he pulled his head back, tearing off some cheese and chewing it a bit. <i>And the cheese...it's so gooey!</i> Giggling a bit in spite of himself, he polished off the rest of the slice and, like Naruto, began cramming tempura into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ate, and their plates diminished, Naruto looked at Kurama out the side of his vision; the young fox was currently taking a drink of his liter of soda (lime-flavored,) leaning back in his seat and drinking directly from the bottle. With a smile, Naruto noticed that he was grinning as he did so...and if he didn't know better, he could have sworn he saw his legs kicking a little bit... <i>Ah, Kurama...never change, buddy, never change.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Naruto went back to cramming chicken down his gullet, Kurama opened an eye and glanced at Naruto, even as he continued drinking. <i>Oh man, this takes me back!</i> he thought gleefully, even as the sweet, bubbly liquid flowed down his throat and into his belly. <i>Me 'n Naruto hangin' out, playing, eating way too much...</i> He felt his eyes begin to sting a bit, and he abrutply turned his head away from Naruto. <i>I'm so happy I ran into him again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued on for quite some time; both the boy and fox tearing into their plates, glugging down their cola for an occasional respite, and throwing each other warm looks and thoughts while they thought the other wasn't looking. All the while, the towering stacks of food on their plates continued to shrink and shrink as more and more of it disappeared into their waiting, eager bellies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, both Naruto and Kurama leaned back in their seats, letting out contented sighs as they patted their bellies happily; their plates were picked completely clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" Naruto sighed, licking his lips, \"now THAT'S how you start a feast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama beamed happily at Naruto, letting out a little burp as he did so. Blushing, he held a hand-paw to his muzzle, though the smile never faded. \"You're not kidding! If the rest of this stuff is HALF as good as what we just ate...\" He squinted his eyes shut, unable to suppress a little giggle. \"...by the time we're done, forget our feet; we won't be able to feel ANYTHING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked, holding a fist up. \"I hear that!\" Kurama, grinning, eagerly returned the fist-bump. \"Still,\" the blonde continued, looking down at his midsection, \"we got a LONG way to go before we reach that point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, in turn, glanced down at his own belly, laughing a bit. \"Heh, true.\" Their formerly flat stomachs, owing to the massive amount of food on their first plates, now formed rather noticeable bumps beneath their respective shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked, poking his clothed belly. \"Yeah, but if we keep THIS up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...we're gonna look like boulders that swallowed even bigger boulders?\" Kurama supplied helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning at the reminder of their first big meal together, Naruto nudged him playfully. \"Eh, with all the stuff we got here, I was thinking...just a little bit bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes brightened. \"Ooh, that's gonna be fun!\" He beamed. \"'Specially if we pop our belly buttons out along the way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked. \"Heh; let's focus on getting our guts a lot bigger first, eh, kiddo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama beamed, resting both hands on his belly and patting it. \"Heh, sounds good to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde winked back at him. \"Well, then, what're we waiting for? There's tons more to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end, both of them took their empty plates and once again stacked them high with every kind of food item present there (with the exception of the desserts, of course). In fact, they made sure to stack them even higher than before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce their plates were loaded up, they settled back in. \"Well, Kurama?\" Naruto asked, doing his best not to salivate at the tower of food upon his plate. \"We digging in or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, momentarily entranced by the sight and scents of his own food tower, nonetheless turned toward Naruto and said...</span></div></div>",

Afterall, we don't wanna let 'em sit there, right?  Plus, all these new flavors taste so sweet!  I kinda wanna try 'em all!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Kurama's eagerness, Naruto couldn't help but smirk as he reached over and ruffled the young fox's head, much to Kurama's amusement. \"Heh, whatever you say, buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Buddy...'</i> Kurama thought with both a sense of pride and gratitude.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how many times he heard Naruto call him that, it still warmed his heart, to be fortunate enough to have a friend like Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, he reached for his lime flavored liter; which still had about two thirds of the fizzy, clear beverage bubbling inside and unscrewed his cap.  Before taking a swig however, he reached over, grabbed a bottle of traditional cola, and handed it to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, thanks!\" said Naruto as he unscrewed the cap.  Kurama simply smiled back and took the bottle to his muzzle, once again tilting his head back and chugging away.  As Naruto was about to take the bottle to his lips, however, he stopped and glanced at the young fox, his heart strings once again getting pulled relentlessly like a harp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Tailed Beast was leaning back with his eyes squinted shut and a warm, happy smile across his muzzle as he gulped down one ample amount of the carbonated beverage after another.  As Naruto looked down, sure enough, Kurama was even kicking his legs about just a little bit from the sheer merriment of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his attention turned to the bottle itself, and Naruto's warm expression became one of near astonishment.  That two thirds of soda previously in the bottle mere moments ago was being rapidly drained down the young Kyuubi's throat and in a speedy hurry at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, no wonder the kid beat me at that ramen eating contest, heh...he can really put it away now!</i> Naruto thought, with an undeniable sense of pride.  For however much stayed the same, a lot really had changed in Kurama's time span.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, within no time at all, Kurama pulled the bone dry bottle from his lips, wiped his mouth with his forearm, and sighed a hearty sigh of relief.  \"Ahhh, now THAT'S refreshing!\" remarked Kurama with a giggle.  Naruto, for his part, just chuckled and; almost jokingly, said, \"Damn, kiddo, I didn't realize you were THAT thirsty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama chuckled a bit sheepishly and rubbed the back of his head as he did.  \"H-heh, yeah, well, what can I say?  It tasted REALLY sweet...aaaaaaand I kinda wanted to finish this one up as fast as I could so I could see what some of the other flavors tasted like.  So-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kurama stopped mid-sentence as his facial expression contorted to one of sudden discomfort, catching Naruto's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you okay, lil buddy?\" he asked in a still light tone, but with some moderate concern.  Kurama, on the other hand, winced a bit and rested a hand against his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rgh, y-yeah, think I just drank a lil too much too fast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than those words exited Kurama's lips did his cheeks suddenly bulged comically, and his eyes widened immensely.  The next thing exiting his lips was particularly explosive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPP!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut from Kurama's mouth came a truly colossal belch, blasting out loud and long for several seconds straight until eventually winding down.  When it was over, Kurama; surprisingly enough, wasn't blushing with embarrassment or shrinking in his seat the way he did the first time he'd accidentally done that.  Rather, a surprisingly blissful look overcame his face as he sighed with relief and slouched in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew!  Ohh maaaaaan, did I need that!\"  Kurama exclaimed, patting his belly proudly and letting out a small burp in the process while Naruto chuckled aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, nice one, kiddo!\"  Naruto exclaimed, giving the young fox a thumbs up, much to Kurama's delight.  \"Heh, it's kinda funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama glanced back at Naruto curiously.  \"Hrm?  Whadduya mean, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's just...remember when you were a kit?  The very VERY first time you ever tried soda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Kurama's face lit up.  \"Oh yeaaaaaah!  I remember!\"  He rubbed the back of his head sheepishly as he recalled that moment.  \"It was all bubbly and I'd never drank anything like that...for a sec, I was actually kinda scared of drinking it cause I thought the bubbles meant it might burn'er something...but then I took a swig and it was the sweetest drink I'd ever had!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled, nodding along as he recalled that moment perfectly.  Then a rather impish grin grew over his face as he added, \"Then, ya let out that monstrous burp...heh, the look on your face afterwards was priceless...\"  At that, Kurama blushed a bit.  \"I didn't even think your face could GET that red til that happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh...yeah...I remember how much the Old Man would scold us if we forgot our manners, and I thought you guys or Ms. Anju might be mad or disgusted...er BOTH...\"  Kurama's smile warmed up a bit as he glanced back at Naruto and added, \"...but you guys were totally cool.  Ya didn't make fun'uh me or get mad...you always made me feel like part'uh the gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Naruto smiled back and patted Kurama on the shoulder.  \"That's cause you are, buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama beamed gratefully to his friend as Naruto just smiled back for a good moment.  Then, Kurama's smile grew a bit more impish as he glanced back at his pal and said, \"Still, that was nothin' compared to that awesome burp you let out at the contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh right, the one that cost me victory...h-heh, guess it WAS kinda awesome, at least...\" remarked Naruto as he grabbed his own cola and proceeded to chug away at a fairly lax pace compared to how Kurama was chugging prior.  As he did, Kurama glanced back at his elder friend, clearly debating if he wanted to ask what he was going to ask, then, with a slightly mischievous smirk, turned to Naruto and...</span></div></div>",

Believe it or not, he's sorta become my mentor...well, <i>one</i> of my mentors at the guild...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled, happy to hear his friend had gotten so close to his new friends. \"Heh, so what, you've replaced me?\" he asked teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile promptly vanished as Kurama's own face dropped, his eyes widening. \"Wh-what?! No!\" Kurama exclaimed, horrified. He looked at Naruto, startling the older boy as he saw the hurt in the young fox's eyes. \"Yeah, the guys at the guild are some of the best people in this or any world, but you're my first friend; my <i>best</i> friend!\" Tears formed in his eyes. \"How could you possibly think I'd ever replace you; that I COULD replace you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily setting his own bottle of soda aside, Naruto reached a hand out and rested it on Kurama's shoulder. \"H-hey, easy there, easy,\" Naruto stammered. \"I-I was just kidding, honest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama sniffed. \"Y-you were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, smiling. \"Of course!

Occasionally, the young man and younger fox would share a competitive but clearly good natured glance, and soldier onward without so much as stopping or catching their breaths.  And all the while, as their bellies took in more and more of their carbonated beverages, they began to expand just ever so slightly more with every few hearty gulps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two drank, Naruto couldn't help but glance over at his young friend.  Even in the initial competitive but playful heat of the competition, it seemed Kurama couldn't help but get lost in the absolute delight of drinking such a tasty beverage, as evident of the young creature leaning back, squinting his eyes shut, with a soft smile on his muzzle...and yes, even occasionally kicking his hind legs as he chugged and chugged.  And even if it was a competition, Naruto could feel his heart warming up considerably at the adorable sight of his little buddy just straight up having a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Nevertheless, Naruto being Naruto...meant he was unable to resist grinning impishly as he thought, <i>Hehe, whelp, glad y'er enjoyin' the moment, kiddo, cause you're about to learn what a REAL burp is...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that thought was also once again deterred by just how immensely his little buddy was visibly enjoying himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after successfully downing about a fourth of their respective liters each, the two youths gasped with relief as they caught their breaths and placed their liters on the tables, and; in unison, both let out huge, bassy belches, which caught both of them off guard, before they both turned to one another and just started laughing uproariously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehe, okay, t-that one didn't count,\" Kurama said, still giggling before catching his breath and getting a more concentrated look on his face.  Naruto, muffling a smaller afterburp with his fist, folded his arms and raised an eyebrow as he watched Kurama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, kiddo, let's see what'cha got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, Kurama presses one paw firmly against his bloated belly.  His muzzle promptly snaps wide open...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRR RRPPPPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and out expels a truly titanic belch, lasting a good few, explosive seconds before winding down.  Naruto smirked, giving the young Tailed Beast a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, not too shabby, lil buddy,\" remarks Naruto as he gives Kurama a friendly pat on the back, causing the young fox to inadvertently burp in the process, earning a chuckle from the two youths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh, thanks!\"  replied Kurama, before grinning impishly and adding, \"...buuuuuuuuut don't get too confident, cause I can burp WAY louder than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Naruto raised an eyebrow, still smirking good natured, if a bit competitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, reaaaaally...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned toothily and said, \"Yep!  Ya should'a heard this one I let out at this one buffet me'n Natsu always eat at...our glasses were actually shaking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...you mean like this...?\" chimed Naruto before thumping his chest firmly with his fist just once...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto let out an exponentially louder and longer belch, which; yes, had indeed caused the tableware to tremble from its' sheer force and volume.  Even Kurama looked rather impressed, marveling at the shaking silverware and plates until it eventually died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting with relief, Naruto grinned and patted his belly proudly.  \"Phew, h-heh, now THAT'S how you do it!\"  bragged the blonde.  Kurama, on the other hand, giggled and held his paw up for a high five, which Naruto promptly returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I gotta admit, that was a good one, Naruto!\" giggled Kurama, though there was an imminent 'buuuuuut' clearly hidden beneath his remark.  \"...buuuuuuuut we still got a buncha soda left, and if ya think I can't beat that, you're gonna be sorely mistaken...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned toothily and nudged the young fox in the arm playfully.  \"Oh, I'm sure you can...but if you think that's the best I got to offer?  You're in for an unpleasant surprise, kiddo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh, weeeeeell, I wouldn't say 'master', I mean, ya gotta hear Natsu!  When he lets out a GOOD one, I swear, it sounds like a dragon's invading the village!  Although...that's probably cause when he DOES let out a huge burp, it's usually accompanied by fire...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah well, no matter how good this pink haired guy might think he is, he ain't ever met-come again...?\"  Naruto blinked dully as his mind caught up and processed what Kurama had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, remember?  Natsu eats fire AND he can breathe it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Kurama chuckled and rubbed the back of his head sheepishly, \"I mean, it can KINDA get awkward if there's property damage, b-but everyone's REALLY understanding, since he always uses his powers to keep everyone safe!\"  Kurama smiled warmly as he glanced back at Naruto and added, \"Like I said, he's a lot like you!  Always puttin' others before himself and doing whatever he can to keep his friends or even complete strangers safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Naruto couldn't help but smile at the notion.  \"Heh, sounds like someone I definitely wouldn't mind hangin' out with sometime...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama beamed at this, but simply said, \"You two would get along really well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it,\" started Naruto, before wrapping his arm around his little buddy and tugging him close in a brotherly fashion.  \"Still, cool as he sounds, you're still always gonna be the coolest person I'll ever know, kiddo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smiled warmly and gratefully, nuzzling against Naruto gently with his eyes squinted shut.  As they peaked open however, Kurama's smile immediately faded as he noticed Naruto a bit misty eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naruto...?  W-what's wrong...?\"  Asked the young fox with feint but evident concern in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his relief, Naruto was still smiling and simply chuckled as he blinked the tears away, tugging Kurama closer as he looked down at his friend and said, \"...Nothing, it's just...just us, hangin' out, having this lil contest, doin' all this together is just...really great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's smile softened a bit as he added, \"...I may've always been alone as a kid...and I got by, but, deep down, I always wanted...just...SOME semblance of family...and, for as long as I've known ya, little buddy...you've been the closest thing to a lil brother that I've ever had, and I just...I want you to know how grateful I am for that...how grateful I am to see how much you've grown, how good you're doing...and how...how even after all that, you still care enough to come back here just to see me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama didn't say anything.  He simply sat, feeling himself get far more misty eyed as he smiled ever warmly at his friend and; like clockwork, hugged him tightly.  \"That's cause you're than just my best friend, Naruto...you're...you're my big brother...in every sense of the word...\"  He hugged tighter and tighter, nuzzling against Naruto with immense gratitude while Naruto pulled him close right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh, sorry, I know that kinda sounds silly, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Don't be...lil bro...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Kurama's tears quickly streamed down his cheeks as his heart filled with an immense amount of warmth and gratitude for his dear friend.  Finally, Kurama opened his eyes and smiled warmly at Naruto who smiled back.  \"...T-thank you...thank you so much, Narut-OOOOOOOOOORRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Aaaaaand instantaneously, Kurama's expression of gratitude quickly turned to one of immense embarrassment as he promptly covered his mouth with both paws after accidentally letting out a massive belch at the end of his sentence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh, s-sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Naruto was too busy laughing to respond.  \"Haha!  Ahhh, don't be, lil bro!  We're having a burping contest, remember?\"  As if to emphasize this point, Naruto thumped his chest and let out a belch that easily rivaled Kurama's, earning a fit of laughter from the young fox as the two eventually disengaged and grabbed their sodas once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, that's enough sappy stuff, time for me to show you how a MAN burps!\"  taunted Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned impishly and said, \"Bring it on, big bro!\"  And, after a competitive but playful glance and grin, the two were once again chugging away...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As before, the two chugged and chugged away at their bottles of soda, neither one willing to fall behind...though unable to resist smiling as they glanced at one another. After all, even if this WAS a competition, it was purely in good fun. Kurama, in particular, seemed to be enjoying himself, as he leaned back in his chair, continuing to kick his legs a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled warmly at this sight; he'd always been able to find joy in the littlest things as a kit, and he was exceedingly happy to see that that hadn't changed in the slightest. Smiling even wider, he returned his attention to his bottle of cola and resumed chugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they gulped away and the level of fluid in the liters slowly but surely depleted, their bellies swelled as they ingested the carbonated fluid. It wasn't anywhere near enough to start forcing their shirts up, at least not yet, but the bumps under their shirts noticeably bulged larger and larger, gradually pushing out in front of them. This was not lost on either the boy nor the fox, who merely grinned and chugged even faster. After all, if their bellies were filling up with that much carbonation, no doubt they'd be able to let loose with some pretty damn explosive belches once they finished....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this thought spurring them on, they tilted their bottles, now containing only about a fourth of liquid each, back further, causing the liquid to flow faster and faster down their throats, and their bellies to push out and swell up quicker and quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with a great sigh, Naruto and Kurama slammed their liters, now bone-dry, to the table and leaned back in their seats, their hands resting contentedly on their bellies. \"Ahhhhh,\" Kurama sighed, smacking his belly (and giggling as it ever-so-slightly sloshed with all the cola packed into it), \"now THAT'S refreshment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned at his young buddy, even as he massaged his belly through his shirt. \"No argument here, lil' bro.\" Kurama grinned right back, eyes absolutely lighting up at the usage of 'lil' bro.' Suddenly, the blonde felt his gut churning and he smirked. \"'Course, that's only half of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, feeling his own tummy gurgling with the sheer amount of cola packed into it, smirked in return. \"Heh, yeah...\" Eyes gleaming, he began eagerly kneading his belly, taking in great gulps of air as he did so. Naruto, grinning eagerly, began doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they kneaded their bellies and  gulped down air, they felt the pressure in their bellies steadily increasing, the carbonation within whipping up an absolute frenzy. Undeterred, they continued on, kneading ever faster and gulping in ever-larger quantities of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Almost...there...</i> both thought as the pressure rose. The pressure built, and built, and built....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...until Naruto, smirking, opened his mouth wide....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and let loose with what had to be one of the loudest, longest belches on record. The table, silverware, and even the floor vibrated from the sheer intensity of the burp. Kurama, even as he continued kneading his own belly, stared in a mix of awe and admiration at the huge burp. <i>Woooooooowwwww,</i> the young fox marveled. <i>That's one of the best burps I've ever heard!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young fox grinned impishly. <i>Still, if he thinks I'm gonna just let that go....he's got another thing coming....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the burp wound down, and Naruto sighed happily, slumping back in his chair. \"Ohhh man, did I need that,\" the boy muttered, happily patting his stomach. He turned toward Kurama, and his expression turned playfully smug. \"Well? What didja think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama shrugged. \"Eh, it was OK,\" he replied, trying to appear unimpressed...and failing entirely, due to the huge grin on his face. Luckily, he was able to replace that with a confident smirk. \"Still...that doesn't have ANYTHING on this...\" As Naruto stared at the young fox in anticipation, the young Tailed Beast closed his eyes, kneaded his belly, winced a bit as he felt the pressure reach near-bursting point....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...then, grinning, he opened his muzzle, wide as he possibly could....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPP PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....and let loose with the most monstrous, most lengthy, most <i>loud</i> belch that NAruto had ever heard. As Naruto stared, flabbergasted, the silverware, table, floor, and yes, even the inn room's <i>furniture</i> vibrated rapidly, and he could have sworn he felt his chair shaking too. As he watched (and felt) the burp drag on, he could only think one word:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the burp wound down, and Kurama went limp in his seat. \"Oh...oh man,\" he muttered, letting one arm hang at his side as the other leisurely massaged his belly. \"That...that has to be a new record...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, looking up at Naruto, he managed a smirk. \"Well, Naruto? Whaddaya think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young ninja said nothing at first, only staring at Kurama in slack-jawed amazement. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That. Was. AWESOME!\" Naruto exclaimed, giving Kurama a hearty pat on the back (and forcing a small belch out of him). \"I've...I've never HEARD anyone belch that loud....OR that long!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes lit up. \"You mean it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto held up a fist. \"Of course I do!\" Kurama, getting his meaning, beamed and bumped fists with his friend. \"I said I'd alwyas be straight with you after we got your situation sorted out in Termina, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama winced a bit at the reminder, but he quickly pushed it away; that was in the past, and he had a bright future ahead of him. \"That you did, Naruto, that you did. And,\" he added, smirking, \"I'm gonna be straight with you about this, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked, curious. \"Straight about what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama winked. \"That I'm gonna finish my second food tower before you finish yours!\" Then, before Naruto could react, Kurama began digging into his tower eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, in spite of himself, smiled. \"Heh, thanks for waiting up,\" Naruto groused playfully, before digging into his own food tower...</span></div></div>",

Despite filling their stomachs to the brim with soda not mere moments ago, they were each ripping into their meals at rapid paces.  Occasionally, glancing back at each other with competitive but all in all, good natured grins across their mugs, the two youths took ample bite after bite of various delights.  From drumsticks, to tempura, to even some fried shrimp, both Naruto and Kurama would wolf it down, sometimes even letting their cheeks bulge comically, before chomping up the delights and gulping down the comically huge mouthfuls of food.  And, after a sigh of relief, a slight belch, or a rub of the tummy to coax some relaxation in their gullets, they'd head right back for more.  Naturally; of course, as this continued, both Naruto and Kurama's bellies gradually began to swell up as they took on more and more food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much so, in fact, that a sliver of flesh had now been exposed beneath Naruto's shirt.  Meanwhile, Kurama's own bloated belly had not only caused a sliver of orange fur to appear beneath his shirt and open vest, but his stomach had also began to push forward considerably against the front of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Kurama had yet to take into account, however, was his belt buckle still fastened nice and tight against his strained waist.  And with competitive edge getting the better of him, the young fox didn't seem likely to catch on any time soon\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a good while, the two stopped for a moment and sighed with immense satisfaction, having their plates picked completely clean\u2026in perfect unison.  Giggling merrily, Kurama playfully jabbed Naruto in the arm and said, \"It's a tie!  Just like how you'n Kiba always used to compete!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping softly, Naruto chuckled then shook his head.  \"Nah, not even dog-breath can wolf down THAT much food and finish at the same time as me.  H-heh, gotta say, kiddo, you've really come a long way.\"  Kurama beamed with pride at that remark, then reached for another liter to wash down his second tower of food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, simply leaned back in his chair, marveling for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh man, I ain't inhaled that much food that fast in ages!\" exclaimed Naruto as he patted his belly with both hands, grinning as he did so.  Kurama, on the other hand, unscrewed a bottle of what appeared to be a ginger ale, and took a hearty few gulps straight from the liter itself, before placing it on the table and smacking his lips.  \"Hehe, believe it or not, but for me, it's actually become more and more of a regular thing!\" remarked Kurama before letting out another loud belch and patting his belly proudly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto simply smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'n Natsu get competitive with food too, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Kurama beamed and nodded eagerly.  \"Ohhh yes indeedy!  We go on a buncha jobs together, and usually after we get 'em done, we like to celebrate by stuffin' our faces with whatever's available!\"  He then chuckles and rubs the back of his head a bit sheepishly as he adds, \"\u2026My other friend, Lucy\u2026she, errr, kinda gets annoyed when we overdo it though\u2026says it's kinda\u2026embarrassing, b-but she's still a really nice and caring person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn't help but laugh uproariously at that, recalling the many times his own pals had said the very same thing about him.  \"Haha, ohhh yeah, been there and then some, kiddo\u2026\"  He said, lightly patting Kurama's shoulder.  \"I wouldn't take it too personally\u2026most people ya meet ain't gonna enjoy stuffin' their faces even half as much as WE do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Kurama nodded eagerly and said, \"That's what makes it so much fun!  It's OUR special\u2026thing!\"  Oddly enough, this earned a warm smile from Naruto as he nodded and ruffled the youngsters head playfully.  \"H-heh\u2026never thought of it that way before\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Naruto's grin grew a bit impish as he leaned down and added, \"\u2026and my thing is finishing this next tower's food before you do, lil bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your dreams, big bro!\" responded Kurama eagerly, still internally touched by the 'lil bro' remark from his 'big bro'.  And in no time at all, the two had piled on their plates with even more food than before and wasted no time savagely tearing into it like no tomorrow.  Naruto was chomping into two drumsticks at a time while Kurama grabbed yet another hearty burger and took a nice, ample chomp, chewing vigorously as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as the young Tailed Beast ate and ate, his ever expanding belly continued to protrude against his pants, pressing against it more and more until the belt buckle had begun to constrict the young creatures tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping the moment it hit him, Kurama winced a bit and set his burger down for a moment.  Catching this, Naruto also stopped and glanced at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything cool, kiddo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, y-yeah, heh,\" responded Kurama as one hand began idly rubbing his belly in attempt to sooth the discomfort.  \"Think my gut just got snagged by my belt.  H-heh, kinda forgot I was wearin' it\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Naruto shook his head, more to himself than Kurama.  \"Ahhh yes, been there too, h-heh, as you've seen, like, tons'uh times\u2026\"  With a shrug, he turned again to the fox and added, \"Probably gonna wanna unbuckle that before it starts hurtin', right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting his head up, Kurama thought on that for a moment...</span></div></div>",

Sticking his tongue out the side of his muzzle in concentration, he reached his hands down below his belly, smirking in satisfaction as his hands found his belt. <i>Alright. Now for the hard part.</i> Squinting his eyes in concentration, he began fumbling around, trying to work around his somewhat-stuffed belly to get a good grip on his buckle. There were a few instances where he appeared to have it, only for it to slip out of his grasp, and for him to grunt in frustration before going back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glanced over at Kurama. \"Uh...you need some help there, little buddy?\" The question was asked lightly, but with a tinge of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama did not move his head, but he turned his eyes toward Naruto, smiling. \"Th-thanks, Naruto,\" the young fox replied, a tone of gratitude in his voice, \"but trust me, this isn't the first time I've had to unbuckle.\" He winked at the human. \"I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked back. \"Well, if you're sure...\" Kurama chuckled, nodded, and returned his attention to his belt. He continued fumbling with it, trying to get a good enough grasp on it to undo it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrggh...come...on...\" Kurama grunted, once again sticking his tongue out the side of his mouth. Naruto watched, frowning, and was just about to volunteer his help again when Kurama finally let out a triumphant \"Ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha, ya little sucker,\" Kurama muttered, smirking as his hands finally closed around his buckle.  Carefully moving his hand-paws, he grabbed the leather strap, pulled it away from the piece of metal that had been threaded through, and pulled the loosened strap out of the buckle. As soon as it was pulled completely free, he let out a sigh of relief, slumping back in his seat even as his tummy bulged out slightly, and both sides of the now-undone belt stuck out to either side of him, framing his belly. \"Ohhh man, did I need that...\" Kurama muttered, idly patting his tummy with one hand and letting his tongue loll out the side of his muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled warmly at his friend. \"Heh; feelin' better, lil' bro?\" he asked, even as he noted how simultaneously goofy and adorable Kurama looked with an undone belt, patting his tummy and sticking his tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama turned toward Naruto and beamed widely. \"Oh yeah, a LOT better!\" the young fox exclaimed, his eyes lighting up. \"Feels like I could eat way more, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed. \"Good to know,\" he replied, before getting a mischievous smile on his face. \"After all,\" he added, poking Kurama's stuffed belly, which now showed just a little bit more of his furry belly than before, \"I KNOW that's nowhere near the biggest your gut can get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama laughed, rubbing the back of his head. \"Heh, trust me, I know!\" Smirking mischievously in return, he poked Naruto's own belly, which still only showed a sliver of flesh through his shirt. \"Still, if I'm remembering right-and I KNOW I am-this isn't anywhere near the biggest yours can get, either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled in return, lightly punching the young fox in the shoulder. \"And trust me, lil' bro, I ain't stoppin' till it's BIGGER than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama gave Naruto a punch in the arm in return. \"Heh; took the words right outta my mouth, big bro!\" He appeared thoughtful for a moment. \"Buuuuut, considering we're eating 'till we can't feel our feet anymore, something tells me that won't be a problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed heartily. \"Heh, I hear ya!\" the blonde exclaimed, patting his own belly for emphasis. However, his smile soon faded, replaced by a thoughtful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto?\" Kurama asked, tilting his head. \"Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh?\" Looking up, Naruto blinked at Kurama. \"O-oh yeah! I'm great! I was just thinkin'...\" seeing he had Kurama's attention, he continued. \"...we're probably not gonna be in much shape to be walking around too much after we're done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama stared at Naruto. \"Yeah...?\" he muttered, trying desperately to conceal the hope on his face. <i>I-is he...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winked at the young Nine-Tails. \"...whaddaya say ya spend the night here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened. \"R-really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled, wrapping an arm around Kurama's shoulders and tugging the fox close. \"Yep!\" He indicated the bed. \"You can even have the bed; besides, I think this room might have a spare futon or tw--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever else he had to say was cut off as Kurama leaned over into Naruto's side and hugged him tightly. \"...thanks, Naruto,\" Kurama muttered, closing his eyes even as he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComposing himself, Naruto patted the young Tailed Beast on the back, smiling warmly in return. \"Hey, you think I'm just gonna let my little buddy waddle back to wherever he's staying in the dark?\" Kurama, even as he hugged Naruto, giggled at the mental imagery. \"Just, uh, I hope you don't mind sleepin' in what you're wearing; I don't think any of my stuff's gonna fit ya...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, Kurama lifted his head and smiled at Naruto. \"Eh, don't worry about that,\" he replied. \"I'm not gonna hafta sleep in what I'm wearing.\" He winked at Naruto. \"I picked up a few tricks at the guild...no telling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit confused, Naruto nonetheless smiled. \"Well, so long as ya got everything sorted out...\" His eyes fell upon the vast bounty of goodies on the table. \"...why don't we get back to stuffing our faces?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama followed his eyes. \"Thought ya'd never ask!\" The young Tailed Beast exclaimed merrily, disentangling himself from Naruto and once again facing the table. The two shared a grin. \"Ya ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nudged Kurama playfully. \"As I'll ever be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that last note, they gave each one final grin, then dug right back into their goodies, shoveling chicken and tempura into their mouths, and interspersing that with bites of pizza and hearty swigs of cola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to eat and drink...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The young man and younger fox resume tearing into their respective feast, both chowing down relentlessly and successfully stuffing their gullets with as much as they could possibly fit into their all-too-eager maws.  Naruto held two slices of pizza; one in each hand, and in rapid succession, he chomped down one slice within a few ample bites, and with gusto, proceeded to do the exact same thing with the other slice.  With both completely demolished, he licked his lips, and promptly reached for two more to repeat the cycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did so, Kurama grabbed yet another burger.  This one...a triple decker...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama couldn't help but gape for a moment..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooooooow...\" the young fox exclaimed, eyes glimmering with astonishment at the sheer mass of meat, sauces, and grilled veggies that awaited him.  Gulping down one of his slices, Naruto smacked his lips and smirked at the sight of his young buddy gaping at the massive burger he was holding up like a long lost piece of art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, ain't she a beaut?\" chimed Naruto.  But Kurama was still too flabbergasted to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've...I've never seen a burger with so much beef before...t-t-THREE patties...?!  And look the size of these things!  They're HUGE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned as he set his remaining slice aside and grabbed one for himself, admiring the sheer size.  \"Can't argue with'cha there, lil bro...I ain't EVER seen burgers this monstrous back home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned to his friend and playfully nudged him with his elbow.  \"Whelp, no sense gawkin' at 'em, right?  We still got tons more to go!\"  At that, Kurama; snapped out of his trance, turned to his dear friend and grinned eagerly.  \"You're right!  And if this behemoth tastes anywhere near as awesome as it smells...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had lost themselves for a moment...practically salivating at the sight of their titanic burgers...until, with one last grin, the two opened their mouths wider than ever...and CHOMPED into their burgers.  The sheer size caused some sauce and burger residue to stain the sides of their mouths, but the two youths were utterly beseeched by the raw, juicy flavors now coating the insides of their mouths, before they both took a hearty gulp in perfect unison...now taking a silent moment to gaze upon the beauty of this massive, and infinitely tasty burger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Aaaaaand promptly, the two dug their faces right in for more, tearing chunk after chunk of burger out, chewing rapidly and gulping it down before digging right in for more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo utterly transfixed were these two youngsters, that they hadn't realized just how much they'd eaten already.  And as they ate and ate, their tummies continued to expand more and more, with no signs of slowing down in remote sight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...That is, until the two youths had reached about the half way point of their monstrous burgers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving reached the half way point, the two stopped for a moment to catch their breaths; both leaning back in their chairs and rubbing their bellies tenderly.  Naruto's belly had swollen to the point where the bottom of his shirt now rested just below his belly button, while Kurama fared about the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh man...\" groaned Naruto as he continued to rub his belly soothingly.  \"...I ain't stoppin' anytime soon, but damn, these burgers are somethin' else, ain't they, kiddo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama opened his mouth to respond, but all that came out was a massive belch, followed by a sheepish chuckle.  Massaging his own immensely swollen belly, Kurama merely smacked his chops and grinned.  \"You said it, big bro...jeez, I've never even SEEN a burger this huge...let alone tried to eat one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled and playfully slugged his younger friend in the arm.  \"Hehe, 'tried to?'  Don'tchu worry, lil bro, you'll not only try, but you'll DEMOLISH this sucker.  I guarantee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite an undeniable fullness, Kurama beamed happily and gratefully at his pal.  It was one thing that always gave Kurama hope...that no matter how much he may have ever doubted himself, Naruto always believed in him...and no matter the hardship, so long as Kurama had that kind of assurance...so long as his best friend had faith, that was almost always all he ever needed to soldier on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Kurama grinned and said, \"We'll both demolish 'em!\"  His grin turned impish shortly after as he added, \"...Afterall...I can still feel my feet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning none-too-innocently himself, Naruto ruffled the young Tailed Beasts' head and said, \"Then let's fix that, kiddo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then reached over and took that first ample bite...then stopped shortly after gulping it down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" muttered Naruto as he placed his burger down and rubbed his belly in discomfort.  He turned and saw Kurama doing the same, and was about to ask if he was okay, when suddenly...in perfect unison...the two stopped, and glanced down past their bellies, and both reached down, to the front of their pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, their stomachs had swollen so greatly that they were now being constricted by the front of their pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah crap,\" muttered Naruto, \"forgot to unzip my pants...again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, trying to reach for his own pants, chuckled sheepishly and added, \"H-heh, I was so busy fumbling with my buckle, I kinda just forgot I even had a zipper for a sec...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two chuckled a bit at their shared lapse, then promptly attempted to unzip their pants to no avail.  Naruto debated seeing if they should unzip each others pants...aaaaand promptly shuddered at how weird that sentence would sound coming out of his mouth.  So, instead, he turned to young Kurama and, with a surprisingly mischievous grin on his face, said...</span></div></div>",

I feel more like stuffing my craw with food till my pants can't take it anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smirked, folding his arms behind his head and looking at Naruto. \"Heh, I know what ya mean: stuffing treat after treat into your mouth, feeling your gut get bigger and bigger, till that bad boy pops off...ain't no feeling quite like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed, giving Kurama a friendly smack on the back. \"I hear ya, buddy; stuffing our faces it is!\" His eyes scanned the goodies on the table. \"Whaddaya think we should eat to fill 'em up? I mean, I kinda wanna bust my button as soon as I can so I can enjoy eating with ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama laughed, a burst of warmth blooming in his chest. \"Took the words right outta my mouth!\" He, too, looked at the table, until his eyes settled on something. \"Let's do tempura; I mean, it's easy to pick up, easy to cram into your mouth, ya can fit a ton in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned, loading his plate up with tempura. \"Tempura it is!\" Beaming at his 'big bro', Kurama promptly started doing the same with his plate, until each had a veritable tower of fried seafood on their plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glanced at Kurama, smiling. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young fox nodded happily. \"Ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without another moment's hesitation, the two immediately dove in, cramming handful after handful of tempura into their mouths, chewing rapidly, and gulping down the massive mouthfuls before immediately going back in for more. Ocassionally, they would find themselves getting a bit parched and took a quick swig of soda before diving back in, but otherwise, they were completely relentless in the gorging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ate, they felt their waistlines getting tighter and tighter as their bellies, constricted as they were, slowly but surely swelled. Up, up, up their respective shirts slid, until they each rested an inch or two above their navels. They winced as they felt the tightness in their waists increase, but they soldiered on, not wanting to give up...and not wanting to spend a single moment more of discomfort in each other's company than was absolutely necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigger and bigger their bellies bulged, and tighter and tighter their waistlines became, until, finally, their pants buttons began to fray. Grinning as they realized this, they ate ever faster, cramming ever-larger mouthfuls into their waiting maws, gulping them down with only the barest minimum of chewing necessary to force them down. They winced every now and then at a particularly difficult mouthful, but they quickly shook it off and continued gorging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, their pants buttons continued to fray, the threads snapping one by one and the small disks loosening, until they were each holding on by the thinnest of threads. Sensing that their buttons were on the verge of snapping, they each gave one another devil-may-care grins, scooped up the biggest handful yet (with TWO hands each), and crammed the whole entire thing into their waiting mouths. Their cheeks bulged comically, and they barely managed to close their mouths as they chewed slowly. Then, when each of their mouthfuls had  been chewed to their satisfaction, they took a great breath through their nostrils and took a single, great, mighty gulp. Miraculously, the masses of food were successfully swallowed, the bulges traveling visibly down their throats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as they plopped into their already swollen bellies, their buttons finally decided that that was the final straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>POP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an audible snapping noise, their buttons burst off their waists in perfect unison, shooting high above the table and thudding into the wall opposite. As though the floodgates had opened, their stomachs violently bulged outward, seeming to grow considerably in the span of a few short seconds. Their shirts hiked further above their belly buttons, and their zippers pulled themselves down several teeth, exposing a glimpse of their respective undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this happened, Naruto and Kurama let loose with a huge sigh of relief, slumping back in utter contentment as their arms flopped to their sides. \"Ohhh man,\" Kurama moaned, sluggishly bringing a hand up to massage his belly, \"that feels SO much better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smacked his belly heartily, grinning as it bounced and sloshed a bit. \"Heh, you were right, lil' buddy; nothin' quite like eating so much your button comes blasting off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned at the older boy. \"Heh, yeah; nothin' quite like feeling all that pressure go blasting away at once!\" He brought his other hand up to his belly, massaging the exposed, furry appendage with both hands now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto burped, licking his lips as he did so. \"Yeah, it's something else, ain't it? In fact...\" His eyes roved over the goodies on the table. \"I feel like I could eat more...WAY more!\" He smirked at his \"little bro\". \"After all, I dunno about you, but I'm pretty sure I can still feel my feet....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama wiggled his own feet, grinning. \"Yep, same here.\" He licked his chops at the sight of all the food still left on the table, rubbing his hands together eagerly. \"Well, then...\" He looked toward Naruto, smirking good-naturedly. \"Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Naruto grabbed the remainder of his massive burger and began taking huge bites out of it. Giggling a bit at the sight, Kurama did the same with his. Their bellies bulged bigger with every few bites they took of their mammoth burgers, slowly forcing their shirts up higher and their zippers down further. In fact, they were so enthralled by both the flavor AND the newfound space in their bellies that they polished the burgers off in record time. Letting out a couple of satisfied belches, they grinned at each other, and immediately began laying into the remaining food on the table...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two youths had successfully demolished their massive burgers each, and with their pants no longer causing any discomfort, both Naruto and Kurama were free to stuff their faces to their hearts content.  Which they did.  <i>Considerably...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was stuffing various egg rolls into his mouth, chomping away and grinning merrily at the burst of flavors, from pork, chives, chicken and even shrimp.  It was damn near impossible for the blonde teen to keep away, as he crammed more and more into his all-too-eager maw, chomping away voraciously as his cheeks bulged rather comically, until he took a remarkably hearty gulp, sighed with relief...only to stuff for egg rolls right back into his maw, and repeat the cycle again and again and again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, on the other hand, was mercilessly tearing into dozens of various chicken wings; boneless, BBQ, Buffalo, the works!  He'd tear the meat clean off the bones in mere moments, and shortly after, stuff his craw full of boneless pieces of chicken and chomp away, beaming happily at the absolutely irresistible flavor each one offered.  And with no buttons holding his ample belly back, both he and Naruto were eating at a rapid pace.  Both youths more than eager to fill their gullets with absolutely every single goodie their feast had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin no time at all, Naruto had downed every single egg roll set before him, and Kurama was now licking his fingers of BBQ sauce as his pile of wings was little more than a pile of bones.  Licking their lips eagerly, the two glanced at one another, smirking impishly as they did so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...can ya still feel y'er feet, kiddo?\"  asked Naruto, earning an eager nod from the young fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that can only mean one thing...\"  Kurama replied, grinning toothily at his 'big bro,' who grinned none-too-innocently right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...We gotta pack away every last ounce of food on the table...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without so much as uttering a word, the two just grabbed whatever they could reach at this point; pizza slices, dumplings, chicken, and everything in between, and just went to town.  The two were like eating machines with no stops in sight.  Slowly but surely, that once seemingly infinite plethora of food was dwindling, as more and more was filling their bellies, which continued to expand and protrude outward more and more with each passing moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut neither one was letting up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntire pizza slices downed in two massive bites at a time, dumplings and beef chunks stuffed into their mouths like mints, egg rolls scarfed down like nothing.  On and on and on this went, as both youths would occasionally stop to catch their breath briefly, rub their bellies soothingly, belch to make as much room as possible in their guts, or just smile at one another as their progress continued.  The two soldiered on like no tomorrow for a good, rampant, ample while; bellies swelling up with each passing moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil finally, with a tremendous and perfectly unison sigh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Naruto and Kurama leaned back in their chairs, rested their hands atop their immensely rounded bellies, and smiled goofy, blissful smiles, as finally, every single ounce of food had been completely wolfed down, and boy howdy did it show...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's belly had rounded to the point where it was nearly touching the table, while his t-shirt was rested now several inches above his belly button.  Kurama's orange furred belly fared roughly the same, with his vest hiked upward at the sides and his shirt now only covering his chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two rested in their chairs, caressing their swollen tummies with both hands soothingly as a look of pure bliss and satisfaction took their faces.  Letting out a long and loud belch, Naruto smacked his lips, turned to his 'lil bro,' and; with a slightly mischievous grin, said, \"Ahhh, whelp, I dunno bout'chu, kiddo...buuuuuut I can still feel my feet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama turned to his 'big bro' and smiled right back.  \"Ohhh, somethin' tells me that's gonna change fairly soon,\" the young fox replied, eying the massive tubs of ice cream and all the goodies that came along with them for emphasis.  Then, a brief look of discomfort grew over the young Kyuubi's face, but before Naruto could inquire if his friend was okay, Kurama slammed his fist against his chest and let out a HUGE belch, once again, easily topping Naruto's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, h-heh, that was a good one!\"  Kurama said as he proudly patted his belly.  Naruto simply smirked and playfully slugged Kurama in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure, ya ALWAYS gotta show me up, don'tcha,\"  Naruto said playfully, earning a giggle from the young fox.  Then, Naruto's grin turned impish.  \"Well, we still got plenty of soda and ice cream left to down, and I PROMISE you, before tonight's feasting is over, I WILL out-burp you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama simply returned with an impish and confident grin of his own and added, \"Weeeell, you can TRY...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two chuckled softly before leaning back in their seats, massaging their tummies soothingly.  \"H-heh, but yeah, now that'cha 'mention' it, that WAS a lotta food.  Guess a lil break wouldn't kill us, right?\"  Added Naruto, as Kurama nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, both youths simply sat in their chairs for a moment, smiling in bliss, basking in the fullness of their bellies in silence and satisfaction for a good while.  Then, Kurama's eyes lit up as he turned to his 'big bro.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...S-say, Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?  What's up, kiddo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, before, I spent so much time talkin' 'bout what I've been up to in Fiore and with my Guild...b-but we never really talked about how <i>you've</i> been these past few yea-errr, I mean, <i>months</i>, h-heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to his young friend, Naruto smiled and said, \"Weeeeell, honestly, there ain't much to say.  I've been on missions left and right, still train a bunch, spar with dog-breath, and, really, the only difference since Termina was how much tighter me'n him got...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Naruto stopped for a moment, and looked, somewhat distantly for a moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Actually...n-now that I think about...there was something else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama glanced at his pal curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...After a long mission or a long day of sparring, I was always too exhausted to do much else besides pass out at my place, but...whenever I had a day off, and was just lazing about, I always...kinda felt...weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Whadduya mean...?\" asked Kurama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Like, I never knew why, but every once in a while, I felt...lonely, like I was missing someone...\"  Said Naruto, before turning his attention to his young friend.  \"...But, with my memories back...I remember now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wrapped his arm around Kurama's shoulders and gently tugged him close as he smiled warmly at the young Tailed Beast, and said; plain as day, \"...It was because I missed my lil bro...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama felt his chest burst with warmth, as he smiled with eternal gratitude for his dear friend, doing his best not to tear up.  \"...I'm sorry...trust me, I...I really wished it didn't have to be that way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Naruto simply laughed and patted the young fox's back lightly.  \"Don't be.  No matter how much I hated the idea of losing the memory of you, it was more than worth it...\"  Naruto then pulled Kurama back a bit and smiled down at him.  \"I mean, look about how awesome you turned out, kiddo!  Your pals at Fiore...they may be eccentric, but seeing you now, I know that...they know what the hell they're doin', and I'm always gonna be grateful to them for giving you the great and exciting life you deserve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was simply too much, Kurama turned away, tearing up as he chuckled and shook his head, despite himself.  \"Ah jeez...again with the cry baby routine, h-heh...s-some things never change, huh...\"  Kurama muttered, laughing some more and wiping his face with his forearm.  But Naruto simply smiled and lightly ruffled the young fox's fuzzy head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, naturally, Kurama smiled and hugged Naruto's side, while Naruto smiled and returned the hug right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well...I'm here now, big brother...\"  Kurama said, nuzzling the teens chest softly as Naruto now found himself feeling that same, bright warmth inside his chest...and technically outside courtesy of the young fox.  Then, surprisingly, Naruto chuckled lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh...kinda reminds me of when you were a kit.  Remember back in Termina, back when I first returned to my normal age?  After all the days' events, I'd passed out on my bed, but then I woke up and found you, just snuggled on my chest, sleeping as peacefully as I'd ever seen any living creature sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama; despite himself, giggled lightly and said, \"That's cause you were the best bed I'd ever had!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed, nodding as more memories of that night kicked in.  \"And you should'a seen Rocket's face when he saw you like that...I SWEAR his heart froze mid-beat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's face immediately lit up at the mention of their wise crackin' ill-tempered pal from Termina.  \"Hehe, guess it really was hard for Rocket to admit he had a heart, huh,\"  Kurama remarked, earning another chuckle and nod from Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but his actions did all the talkin' for him.  He and Groot really came through for us back then...\"  Naruto replied, as Kurama nodded, equally grateful for all Rocket had done.  \"...I just hope Rocket and Groot're stayin' outta trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned mischievous and added, \"Knowin' them?  You can guarantee they ARE the trouble!\"  At that, the two laughed softly for a moment, then, Kurama turned to Naruto and said, \"...Time really flies, doesn't it, Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, and; with a devilish grin, turned to his dear buddy and said, \"...Not as soon as all Sundae's gonna fly...whadduya say, kiddo?  Ready to polish this night off with one HELLUVA sundae...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama thought for a moment...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Actually,\" Kurama began, turning back toward the table and rubbing his belly, \"could we maybe wait a few more minutes? Gotta let all that food settle.\" To emphasize this, he patted his belly heartily, freeing a rather loud burp from his muzzle. Blushing, Kurama rubbed the back of his head. \"Ehehehe....sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Naruto let rip with a belch of his own. \"Don't worry about it, buddy.\" As Kurama giggled, the blonde smiled at him. \"And sure, we can take a break; 'sides, I wanna be at my best when I'm digging into a monster sundae with my little bro.\" As he said this, he threw a friendly arm about Kurama's shoulders, and the young fox couldn't help but beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a few seconds, though, before a thought occurred to Naruto; something he'd idly wondered about earlier in the day. \"Say, Kurama...\" he began, turning his head toward his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerking up, Kurama looked toward Naruto. \"Yeah, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing he had the fox's attention, Naruto continued. \"Earlier today, when you showed up in your Kotetsu disguise...what was with that locket you had around your neck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama's expression seemed to sober up considerably. \"Th-the locket?\" he repeated, actually looking a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat confused at this reaction, Naruto nonetheless continued. \"Yeah. I mean, no offense, but it didn't really go with the rest of your look, so I'm thinkin' it wasn't part of your transformation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama chuckled nervously, rubbing the back of his head. \"Yeah, well...I kinda like to keep it on me whenever I can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama nodded slowly. \"Y-yeah,\" the fox replied, almost looking a little embarrassed. \"It's...it's kinda special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Special?</i> Naruto thought, a bit confused. Shaking that thought off-Kurama seemed sort of reluctant to talk about it, and he didn't want to force him-he instead asked, \"And...where are ya keeping it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama smiled a bit and held his hand up. To Naruto's shock, a light appeared in his hand, eventually resolving into a distinct shape. By the time it fell into Kurama's hand, it had taken the recognizable form of the locket, chain and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gaped. \"Kurama...what...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Requip magic,\" Kurama explained. \"It's a sorta magic that allows you to store stuff in a pocket dimension and summon 'em whenever ya need them.\" He smiled lopsidedly. \"I'm nowhere near as good as Erza-she's one of my friends at Fairy Tail, and she has tons of weapons, clothes, and armor, and she can summon 'em like they're nothing!-but I can still do enough to store a few outfits, a few personal knick-knacks...ya know, that sorta thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, only somewhat understanding. \"And...ya keep that locket there a lot of the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama nodded, looking toward the locket in his hand. \"Yeah...\" he replied, a fond smiile forming on his face. \"I like to keep it safe, 'cause...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated a bit, prompting Naruto to lean in close, visibly concerned. However, before he could inquire as to what was wrong, Kurama looked toward him...and Naruto was surprised to see an almost embarrassed look on the young creature's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...'cause it's one of my most prized possessions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That</i> took Naruto by surprise. \"R-really?\" Naruto asked curiously. \"What's inside it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, Kurama flinched a bit. \"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling warmly, Naruto put a hand on Kurama's shoulder. \"Ya don't have to tell me if you don't want, but ya also don't have to be embarrassed about anything.\" The blonde winked. \"Heck, if it's one of your most prizied possessions, that's good enough for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smiled in return, though the nervous look remained. They looked at each other for a few more moments, until Kurama gulped and asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promise you won't laugh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit surprised at the question, Naruto simply grinned and emphatically shook his head. \"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving Naruto a grateful nod, Kurama turned back to the locket. Slowly, he turned it around so that the opening side faced in front of them, reached a finger toward it, edged it open...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and suddenly, there was a flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winced and covered his eyes. \"Wh-whoa, what the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...just give it a sec,\" Kurama replied, sounding oddly subdued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, in the span of a few seconds, the light had died down, and Naruto cautiously lowered his arm...and gaped at the sight before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama fidgeted a bit in his seat. \"Erm...remember that one picture we all took together? Ya know, the one I took with me to Fiore?\" Naruto said nothing, only nodding numbly in response. \"Yeah, well...some of the guys at Fairy Tail knew people who could enhance stuff like that. So, they worked their magic, put it in a locket, and, well...\" he reddened a bit. \"...here ya are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto only gave a quick nod, staring at the sight that was projected from the locket toward the opposite wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, standing against the wall, was a life-sized image of several individuals, all grouped together. A spiky-haired, brunette teenager, about Naruto's age, with red triangles on his cheeks and animalistic eyes, stood to the right, arms folded as he gave the camera a cocky smirk. Beside him, a gigantic white canine sat comfortably, giving the camera his best doggie smile. To his far left, what appeared to be a brown-furred, bipedal wolf with human proportions and wearing clothes winked at the camera, giving it a toothy smile and a peace sign. To the far back, what appeared to be a massive, humanoid <i>tree</i> stood calmly, a warm smile on its face and its arms hanging comfortably at his sides. On its shoulder, what appeared to be a bipedal <i>raccoon</i> with some sort of massive metal object on its back looked at the camera, arms folded in a cocky manner and the side of its muzzle turned up in an equally confident smirk. And, in the foreground, Naruto stood, beaming at the camera. On his shoulders, Kurama, there a young kit, was held comfortably on his shoulders, wearing an outfit that included a shirt with adorably oversized sleeves. Both were held up in the are, his paws barely poking out of them as he waved them about, a wide, merry grin on his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gaped, his jaw dropping. <i>He...he actually had that picture made into something like this...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Naruto's dumbfounded expression,  Kurama laughed nervously. \"H-heh, something, isn't it? I mean, it's not perfect-it flickers every now and then-but whenever I'm feeling down, it's sorta a reminder of some of the best days of my life.\" Naruto turned toward him at this, his mouth still gaping. \"The days when I met some of the best friends I could ever ask for...the days I was finally allowed to live my own life...\" he paused, looking at Naruto. \"...the days I met my big brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at Kurama, completely lost for words...though his eyes started to get rather misty-looking. Slightly worried, Kurama tilted his head. \"N-Naruto? Are you OK---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped as, without warning, Naruto lunged toward him, wrapping his arms around Kurama and pulling him in tight for a hug. \"N-Naruto?\" Kurama stammered. The blonde's only reply was to hug the fox even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama's shock faded...and his own eyes began misting up. His muzzle trembling slightly, he threw his arms about Naruto's upper body, hugging him back. Neither said anything for a moment. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I love you, little brother...\" Naruto muttered in an unusually hushed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his eyes shut even as tears squeezed out of them, Kurama sniffed. \"....I love you too, big brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two of them lapsed into silence once again, neither letting up in their close embrace for a good, long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not even the immensely bloated midsections of the young man and younger fox mattered.  For these two youths; in this very moment, all that mattered to either one, was the other, and the true and genuine brotherly bond and love these two shared for one another.  Granted, both had an abundance of friends from their respective worlds, some very very close friends that they would fight to the ends of the world for.  Yet, none that had truly become the only semblance of family either creature truly had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, their embrace continued.  Both Naruto and Kurama hugged each other tight, eyes shut as tears streamed down their cheeks, and the softest of smiles formed over both Naruto's face and Kurama's muzzle.  No words were spoken, as none were needed.  The two youths simply embraced one another, until finally, they opened their eyes and lightly disengaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh...sorry,\" Kurama muttered, wiping his eyes with his forearm, \"...me'n the waterworks, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto simply chuckled, softly wiping his own face then playfully jabbing his young friend in the arm.  \"Nothin' to be ashamed of, lil bro...just means y'er honest with yourself, and comfortable enough to be honest with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smiled warmly, still wiping his face as he turned to his dear friend, then back down at his locket.  Both gazed upon it fondly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know...\" Naruto began as he examined the image a bit more, \"...I remember back when Hunter first told me'n dog breath we were all stayin' in Termina for the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Kurama chuckled and rubbed the back of his head.  \"You guys were pretty freaked out, huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, sure were.  I mean, we still had missions and everything in Konoha going on.  To disappear from the face of our world to hang out in a completely new world was...well...kinda nerve wrecking at first.  I mean, we thought we were gonna get into HUGE trouble for being gone so long and suddenly without even warning anybody!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's focus shifted to all the faces in the picture, and the lovely backdrop of the lush and vibrant Termina behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But then, we came to see why Hunter brought us to this place...it was truly magical...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smiled, nodding in agreement as he too; gazed upon all his friends, recollecting the truly magical times they all shared in Cloctown and all the sights Termina had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what'chu mean...it was such a pretty and really fun place with so much to do...and almost everyone we met was super friendly!\" remarked Kurama, omitting a few choice encounters that...weren't as pleasant.  Nonetheless, the young fox pushed that thought back, and giggled some more as he rubbed his bulbous tummy fondly.  \"And who could forget that amazing Zora cuisine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Naruto laughed, patting his own rounded belly in agreement.  \"Definitely neither of us...and of course, let's not forget Rocket's totally kickass cooking'n baking goodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Naruto's smirk became a bit more good natured as he added, \"...But it wasn't just how fun and really colorful Termina was...it was about being able to share that with my closest friends...\"  He smiles down at Kurama and lovingly ruffles his head lightly, \"...and my best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike earlier, Kurama's eyes begin to glisten, but he works up a thankful smile at his dear 'big brother' and quickly blinks his tears away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike before, a moment later, Kurama grins impishly then playfully pokes Naruto's bloated belly and says, \"Yuh'know what else'll be great to share?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping, Naruto's eyes lit up as his attention immediately turns back to the ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeaaaaah!\"  Naruto exclaimed, almost as if to remind himself.  \"H-heh, sorry, guess all the mushy stuff's got me all distracted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama simply giggled and said, \"Heehee, don't worry, big bro, you ain't alone there.  Buuuuuuut now that we remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even needing an additional prompt, Naruto stumbled up to his feet, and promptly, helped his 'lil bro' do the same before the two headed over to the vast...VAST amounts of ice cream and all the treats along with them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGallon after gallon, treat after treat, and topping after topping; all of it, after some comical doing, found its way into a steadily increasing mountain of a sundae, until eventually, every single bit of it had been strategically dumped into the massive bowl for the two to consume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is, lil buddy...it may not be as big as the one we ate when we were young, but it's pret-ty damn close...\" exclaims Naruto.  Then, an impish grin grows over his face as he playfully nudges the young fox and adds, \"...and besides...THIS time...it's aaaaaaall for you'n me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis earned another giggle from the young creature as he nodded and added, \"Heehee, and of course, don't forget about all the soda we still have left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...ohhhh don'tchu worry, kiddo...I didn't forget...\" replied Naruto with a devilish smirk across his face, before his expression lightened up and he handed the young fox a large spoon.  \"So,\" began Naruto, \"...ready to chow down on this bad boy of a sundae, lil bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if ya need tuh ask...\" replied Kurama, earning a nod of approval from a pleased Naruto, before he took his own spoon, and after once last glance between the two, both youths grinned, and dug right in...</span></div></div>",

Their eyes moving to look at each other, they grinned, lifted their spoons high, and proceeded to dig in with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, bits of ice cream, sauce, candy, brownie, and assorted other toppings began flying every which way as both boy and fox shoveled mouthful after mouthful of the frozen behemoth before them into their eager maws. As such, it wasn't long before their efforts began making a noticeable dent in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto powered on, grinning as he spooned mouthful after mouthful into his waiting maw, only pausing occassionally to wipe his face with his sleeve. <i>Oh man,</i> he thought, licking his lips and diving back in, <i>this sundae's pretty damn good! 'Course, it has practically every flavor and topping the village had to offer...</i> He smirked, even as he gulped down a particularly large mouthful; no one could ever say he went half-way with anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, in the meantime, was having the absolute time of his life as he spooned great, heaping helpings into his mouth. <i>Mmmm...it's so yummy!</i> Kurama thought gleefully, unable to suppress a tiny giggle...or a merry kicking of his legs. <i>There's so many different flavors, and it's so creamy, and...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile became a bit more wistful, but he didn't allow himself to slow down; Naruto looked like he was enjoying himself too much to be distracted with more mushy stuff. <i>...and it sorta reminds me of the first meal I ever had with him...all those years ago...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warmth bloomed in his chest as he remembered a small, grinning blonde boy, who had, practically from the minute they'd \"met\", never been anything but supportive, friendly, and utterly welcoming to him...even when, by all accounts, he should have hated his guts....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama winced, and hoped Naruto didn't notice. <i>No. That's not me anymore. I have my own life to live, now; my own home, my own friends...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mix of sadness and gratefulness came over him; that fateful night in Termina, when he'd woken up from awful, awful dreams of destruction, fire, and hatred, Naruto, Hunter, Kiba, and Akamaru had told him the truth of his situation. He'd been devastated and horrified; he could never have imagined growing up into something like <i>that</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, though, all of them-Hunter, Naruto, Kiba, Akamaru, even Rocket and Groot-had come through for him, and devised a solution that would allow the adult him-the malevolent, hateful him-to reform inside of Naruto, but allow him to continue living as a separate being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weeks that had followed had been, hands down, the absolute happiest days of his life: playing around Clock Town, exploring all that Termina had to offer with Naruto (now at his proper age), eating so much they couldn't move afterwards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when he'd been forced to say goodbye to Naruto and the others (he felt a lump in his throat at this, even as he gulped down more ice cream) and Hunter had brought him to Fiore, he had found that he had been able to settle into life there fairly easily, once the initial adjusting period had passed: he had an abundance of great friends, got to study and learn magic...and of course, things were never, ever boring at Fairy Tail, whether it was the frequent bar fights, new arrivals to the guild (he still remembered when he'd gotten back from that one job and had met Lucy; it hadn't taken long for her to become a friend), or just plain goofing off in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still,</i> he thought as he spooned more ice cream into his waiting mouth, <i>nothin' compares to being with my big bro again...</i> He looked fondly at Naruto, who was still engrossed in the sundae...before the young fox continued digging in with gusto. <i>What am I doin' thinkin' all this deep stuff right now? There's ice cream to be eaten!</i>  Licking his chops, he eagerly threw himself back into the delicious dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime ticked by, and as more and more ice cream entered their bellies and the dent in the monstrosity grew, it began to show. Their bellies, having long since forced both their zippers fully open, expanded more and more; Naruto's shirt slowly slid ever higher above his navel, all while growing closer and closer to the table. Kurama's furry belly didn't fare much better; though his shirt was relatively unaffected, since it was already hiked up to his chest, the sides of his vest continued to bunch up and hike upwards further. And, as both of them pressed on, neither noticed that their fully-undone pants were nonetheless beginning to feel rather tight. What flew even lower under the radar, however, was a rather peculiar sensation in the middle of their growing tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

The young fox looked away evasively as he sat perfectly still, appearing jolted.  Naruto turned his attention to the young fox; already catching on as he smiled playfully and tapped on the young Tailed Beasts' shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feelin' okay there, buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama; ears perking upward, immediately turned to Naruto, eyes looking upward, and to the left, and...ANYWHERE else but Naruto's direction as he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh?  Oh!  Y-yep!  Yepyep!  Just fine!  H-heh!  Nothin' rippin' er anything like that!  Nope!  Not at all!  W-what pants ripping?  H-heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was admittedly amused by how utterly flustered Kurama was at what had happened.  To the young fox's alarm, Naruto started laughing, but it was most certainly a playful laugh as he wrapped his arm around Kurama's shoulder and tugged him playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, ahhh c'mon, lil buddy, it's ME...ya don't gotta be embarrassed or anything like that,\" Naruto assured, still chuckling softly.  Kurama chuckled a bit sheepishly as he nodded hesitantly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh...y-yeah, I-I know, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, in case ya forgot...\"  Naruto leaned back as best he could and slapped his immensely bloated belly, causing it to jostle as he reached over and playfully patted Kurama's own orange-furred medicine ball of a belly in turn, causing it to jostle and bounce a bit as well, making Kurama giggle a bit, despite himself as Naruto smirked and added, \"...we ARE eatin' to the point where we can't feel our feet, right?  Well, ya don't think what we're wearin's gonna be able to hold all that without some wear'n tear, do ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh...well, now that'cha mention it, I guess not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!  Which means I'll be rippin' my pants in no time too!\"  Kurama snickered at this realization.  Then, Naruto raised an eyebrow as he glanced at how bloated the young fox's tummy had become, and; upon resting a palm against it and playfully rubbing Kurama's belly, added, \"<i>In faaaaaact</i>...y'er puttin' this bad boy away at some pretty awesome paces, buddy...if I didn't know any better, I'd say the reason ya tore your pants before me is cause you're actually managing to put away more than I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama's eyes lit up as he turned to Naruto, almost a bit surprised.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me...?  Eating more than YOU...?  Ya really think so, big bro...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Naruto laughed and held his arms out.  \"Hey, didja hear MY pants rippin' yet?\"  Naruto's grin turned impish as he added, \"S'pose I shouldn't be TOO surprised...I mean ya DID beat me at that ramen eatin' contest, right?\"  In turn, Naruto playfully slugged Kurama in the arm, causing the young fox to snicker and smile himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, well, it WAS a close one...buuuuuuuuut I guess ya got a good point there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course I do!  You're Kurama!  A lean, anything-but-mean, eating <i>machine</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama laughed merrily at Naruto's unofficial 'title' for him...it was certainly one he definitely wouldn't mind having announced next time he ever took part in an eating competition.  Even Naruto couldn't help but laugh right along side him.  But still, Kurama couldn't help but smile gratefully at his dear 'big bro'.  No matter the situation; be it embarrassing, disheartening, or seemingly impossible...regardless of whatever it was, Naruto always had a natural knack for making Kurama just feel good.  Good about himself, good about his accomplishments...or in this case...good about eating so much that he tore the front of his pants and exposed his 'Fairy Tail' Guild Patterned Boxers.  Big or small, Naruto just knew how to turn an otherwise embarrassing situation into one where everyone could be laughing.  He never gave Kurama a reason to even feel embarrassed.  Even just a few moments ago when Kurama had accidentally mistook Naruto's 'getting replaced by Natsu' joke for something serious, Naruto was able to help the young fox know it was okay and that he had nothing to be ashamed of.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the outside observer, it would seem a strange notion that something so simplistic could mean so much to the young fox, but truly, it was because Kurama knew that was just how caring his best friend was.  He was a genuinely kind hearted person through and true, one Kurama had often hoped to aspire to be when he grew up.  So much so that, out of sheer respect and honor for Naruto, he had even come to go by the surname of Uzumaki back in Fiore.  Simply put, he was just grateful to be able to call Naruto a friend, let alone his best friend and 'big bro.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, smiling at his big bro, Kurama playfully jabbed Naruto's arm right back and, with a gradually more impish grin, he added, \"Well, then let's see if you can catch up, big bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning right back, Naruto nodded eagerly.  \"NOW y'er speakin' my language, kiddo!\"  And in no time at all, the two dove right back into the sundae...</span></div></div>",

Grinning, he began eating even faster, spooning mouthful after mouthful of ice cream into his mouth, heedless of the bits of ice cream and topping that flew about. With each mouthful, the front of his orange pants became tighter, tighter, tighter, until....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIPPPPP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...with a mighty tearing sound, the front of Naruto's pants tore wide open, exposing his heart-patterned boxers. At the loud noise, Kurama stopped, spoon halfway to his mouth, and glanced over at Naruto, who had begun grinning and smacking his oversized stomach. \"Haha, now THAT'S what I'm talking about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama beamed. \"Wow! You ripped your pants already, Naruto?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde beamed in return. \"Yep, sure did! I'd show ya, but...\" he gestured to his overstuffed belly. \"...this thing's kinda in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled. \"Don't worry, Naruto; I heard the ripping loud and clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled, playfully tweaking Kurama's ears. \"Kinda hard not to, with these things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayfully swatting Naruto's hand away, Kurama beamed so wide his eyes squinted shut. \"Heh heh, yeah, not a whole lot gets past these things...\" He opened his eyes, but the grin remained. \"Anyway, now that we've busted our buttons and ripped our pants, there's only one thing left to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked playfully. \"What, you mean finishing this monster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama snickered, his eyes sparkling with a mischievous gleam. \"Well, yeah, obviously that, and make sure we can't feel our feet afterwards, but besides that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Naruto thought for a moment...before his eyes lit up with realization. \"Oh! You mean...\" then, instead of continuing, he reached a finger toward Kurama's rounded orange tummy and poked and prodded, much to the young fox's amusement, until he felt a small pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Kurama nodded, patting his belly heartily and causing it to jostle a bit. \"Yep.\" As he did this, he reached a digit of his own out and poked Naruto's innie navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked. \"Well, of COURSE we hafta pop our belly buttons! It's one of the best parts of stuffing our faces!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama laughed. \"Heh, no kidding; the way all that pressure goes POOF, how silly it looks, and of course the way it feels when ya play with it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto playfully nudged his friend. \"Heh, yeah, I remember what you were like the first time you ever popped your belly button, when we were all eating that huge sundae. You looked so damn fascinated with it...and you looked like you were having  the time of your life when you started wiggling it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled, fondly remembering the moment. \"That's 'cause I'd never felt anything like it! It was ticklish, and tingly at the same time...even when I did it again and again in Termina,and when I've done it in Fiore, it never gets old!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto ruffled Kurama's head fondly. \"Can't argue with that, little buddy; never felt anything like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smirked. \"Well, we did, and we can...just as soon as we get back to eating this monster!\" With that, he turned back to the sundae and started spooning ice cream into his mouth, faster than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned, turning back to the sundae as well. \"Took the words right outta my mouth, little brother!\" And, with that, he resumed tackling the sundae with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime ticked by as the two devoured the sundae. Gradually, their stomachs swelled even bigger, and that familiar tightness began to form in their bellies. Galvanized by this realization, they went even faster. Bigger and bigger their stomachs grew, and tighter and tighter their midsections felt, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Occasionally, they'd wince in discomfort as that tightness in the middle of their bellies grew tighter and tighter.  Squinting his eyes shut slightly, Kurama; shortly after gulping down a particularly large spoonful of ice cream, rested one palm against his belly and rubbed it as soothingly as he could.  \"Ooh man...\" the young fox groaned in discomfort, \"...ugh, I almost forgot how much this part hurts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, nodding slightly in agreement as he rubbed his own bulbous belly, smirked weakly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I know what'cha mean,\" Naruto said, before kneading his belly slightly and burping a few times then, with a smirk, adding, \"...but that only means we're gettin' closer.  H-heh, remember, that horrible tightness ya feel getting worse'n worse?  That's gonna make that sweet pop all the sweeter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling weakly, Kurama grinned and said, \"Then I'm guessin' we're right around the finish line, huh...\"  The young tailed beast promptly grabbed his spoon and held it up before grinning with a bit more determination at Naruto.  \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning right back, Naruto grabbed his spoon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with vigor, the two drove their spoons right into the massive sundae, and resumed shoveling more and more ice cream into their mouths, taking big heaping mouthfuls and gulping them down, sending large bulges of the frozen treat down their throats and into their steadily expanding bellies.  All the while, that tightness grew ever more agonizingly tight.  But despite that, the pair soldiered on, eating more and more as their midsections began to bulge little by little.  Sure enough, a strange sort of vibrating could be seen from the middle of their bellies; specifically right around their belly buttons.  And still, they ate and ate and ate, until...at long last...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>*POP!*</b></i></u> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>*POP!*</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn perfect unison, both Naruto and Kurama's eyes widened as their bellies jolted slightly, and from their former innies, out popped fleshy stubs that were now their inverted navels.  The two youths immediately shared a look of complete and utter bliss as they practically melted into their seats.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh yowza,\" remarked Naruto with a goofy grin on his face as he slumped backwards into his chair, \"...that feels SOOOOO much better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama simply went cross eyed for a moment and grinned a doubly goofy grin as his tongue lolled out of the side of his muzzle.  \"Holy crap, did I need that,\" the young fox remarked before grinning at Naruto and nudging him in the arm.  \"Was it worth it or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning back at his younger companion, Naruto glanced down at Kurama's fuzzy, still wobbling stub and; grinning more impishly, said, \"You tell me,\" before reaching over and playfully wiggling it around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing uproariously, Kurama playfully swatted at Naruto's hand before taking his finger and wiggling it himself, giggling with amusement.  \"Heehahaha!  Oh man, I always loved how funny this felt,\" the young fox replied.  Turning to his own inverted navel, Naruto wiggled his around and chuckled aloud as well.  \"Haha, amen to that, kiddo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over his own vaster belly as a whole, Naruto grinned toothily.  \"And I dunno about'chu, but me?  I feel like I can DEFINITELY take on this sundae now!\"  Naruto said, giving his belly a hearty slap and letting out a particularly loud burp in the process.  Laughing, Kurama grinned at Naruto and said, \"Hehe, nice one, big bro!\"  He then glanced at his own massive, rounded fuzzy orb of a belly and added, \"And I'm right with'cha on that one!  I'm ready to scarf down so much ice cream and soda that I won't be able to feel my feet for a good long while!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned right back at the young fox and playfully slugged his arm.  \"That's my bro!\"  He said with a laugh before grabbing his spoon and adding, \"Ready to polish this sucker off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned right back and licked his chops.  \"I've never been more ready...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a look of eagerness and determination, both youths turned to the remainder of their sundae, and tore right into it, faster than ever, thanks to the tightness in their midsections being eased with those resounding 'pops'...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reinvigorated by the big \"pop\", Naruto and Kurama tore into their sundae, faster than ever, sending bits of ice cream flying everywhere and getting as much of it on their faces as on their mouths. They were relentless, barely stopping for breath as they shoveled the frozen treat into their waiting mouths. Every now and again, they would pause to take several huge gulps of cola, only stopping to let out a satisfied burp before jumping right back into their sundae. And, as the remainder of the sundae and the soda steadily depleted, their already vast tummies swelled more and more. Naruto's stomach pushed further outward, pressing against the table, so much so that h had to adjust it a bit so it was on top of the table so as not to get wedged in. His shirt, already resting completely on top of his globular orb of a stomach, began straining at the seams. Eventually, several of the seams gave way with a loud POP, exposing more of the sides of his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama wasn't faring much better. His stomach grew even larger and heavier in his lap, forcing his legs apart. His already-ripped pants began ripping even further down the front, exposing more and more of his undergarments, and his vest hiked up even higher. His shirt, also completely on top of his belly, stayed where it was. At one point, realizing his belly was pressing against the table, he scooted back, hefted it up, and placed it on top, before scooting back in and continuing to gorge himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for quite some time-the sundae shrinking, the levels of soda in the bottles depleting, and their stomachs growing ever larger-until, finally, both their spoons clattered to the bowl, the dish empty and the bottles of soda bone-dry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving dopey smiles, both Naruto and Kurama slumped back in their chairs, resting their hands on their bellies. \"Oh...URP!...Oh MAN,\" Naruto moaned, sluggishly licking his lips, \"Now THAT'S...that's what I call a dessert...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smacked his chops, gently massaging his belly. \"Size of that sucker...I won't hafta eat for a few months....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the two of them, one could certainly believe both of those assessments. Both of their stomachs, resting on the table, were easily the size of large beach balls, their distended navels wobbling with the slightest movement. Underneath the table, their pants were almost completely torn down the front, exposing not just their underwear, but parts of their bare (or furry) legs as well. Kurama's shirt rode up to his chest along with his vest; several of the seams on Naruto's shirt were busted wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama suddenly groaned; concerned, Naruto glanced over at him. \"H-hey, you OK, Kurama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama opened an eye and looked back at NAruto. \"Y-yeah, I'm fine; it's just, I think I've eaten so much I've lost all sensation in my feet...\" His eyes widened as he processed that statement, and he beamed widely. \"Guess it's \"Mission accomplished\", then...\" He looked at Naruto's belly. \"What about you, big brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto got a thoughtful look on his face, and twisted his feet about a bit. He grinned as, despite knowing he'd moved them about, the areas from his ankles down were completely numb. \"Heh, yep; can't feel my feet either, little buddy. Like ya said...\" He held a fist up in the air. \"...mission accomplished.\" Beaming, Kurama eagerly returned the fist bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after, they slouched back intheir chairs, sitting in companionable silence. Unsurprisingly, it was Naruto who broke the silence. \"So...what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smirked. \"Whaddaya think? We crash for the night, and rest these things off.\" He patted his belly heartily, giggling as it jostled noticeably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed, bleching as he did so. \"Sounds like a plan to me...\" He winced as he struggled to his feet, holding his ruined pants up with one hand and supporting himself on the table with the other. \"Ugh...size my gut is now, I'd be better off sleeping on the floor, forget the futon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama frowned as he staggered to his feet, also supporting himself and his ruined pants. \"You...you sure you don't want me to sleep on the floor? I mean, when I go out on jobs sometimes, I hafta sleep in some less-than-comfy places...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's heart warmed at that, even as he raised a brow. \"Aww, thanks, little bro...but after all this time, I'd be damned if I let ya sleep on the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama thought for a moment. \"Well...alright,\" he conceded, though he still didn't look entirely happy with it. \"At least lemme kick some blankets on the floor for ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed, playfully nudging a shoulder into the young fox. \"Heh; consider it done...\" He winced as the weight of his belly threatened to pull him down. \"But, uh, let's focus on actually GETTING over there, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama laughed. \"Yeah, that would help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled warmly at his friend's good humor...before something he'd asked earlier clicked in his mind. \"Hey, Kurama...when you said I'd see what you'd do for your sleeping clothes...what didja mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama's expression brightened. \"Oh yeah! Remember the Requip magic I told ya about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded. \"You mean that magic that lets ya summon stuff outta your own...pocket-dimenion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama nodded. \"Yep, but that's not all it's good for.\" With this, he closed his eyes, concentrated...and to Naruto's shock, his buddy's ruined clothes began to glow, growing brighter and brighter. Wincing, Naruto squinted his eyes shut to protect against the light. Once the light began to fade, Naruto slowly blinked his eyes back open...and gaped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn place of the ruined attire he'd been wearing a moment prior, Kurama now wore a set of fully-intact pajamas; specifically, a pair of black shorts, and a red pajama shirt with some sort of yellow fox face on the front. However, it was still ill-fitting; his shirt rode completely atop his belly, and his shorts were being stretched to their limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling at Naruto's dumbfounded expression, Kurama explained. \"See, Requip magic also lets ya store whole outfits, and you can summon 'em on you whenever you wanna. Comes in handy when ya don't have time to change normally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of his confusion, Naruto laughed. \"Heh, guess it does...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething suddenly clicked, and he stared closer at Kurama's attire. \"Hey, Kurama, those PJ's look really familiar...\" Come to think of it, what was that fox-creature called again...a Keaton...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama actually blushed a bit and looked away. \"Er, yeah...that's 'cause...they're bigger, custom-made versions of the jammies I wore as a kit back in Termina.\" He winced a bit. \"Ya probably think I'm crazy, right? Getting clothes made that are exactly like the ones I used to have...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared... before giving Kurama a warm smile. \"Crazy? Those were some of the best times of my life!\" At this, Kurama looked up, his eyes widening. \"Nothing wrong with wanting to keep a little reminder of that with ya.\" Kurama, though still blushing, managed a smile. \"Besides,\" Naruto added, his eyes sparkling with mischief, \"you always looked adorable in those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's blush returned full force, and he rubbed the back of his head. \"Aww, Naruto...\" Then, before any more embarrassment could set in, he reached both arms under his belly, and, with a mighty \"hup!\", he hefted it off the table. He staggered under its weight, but kept its balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked. \"Heh, my thoughts exactly.\" Still gripping his ruined pants, he cradled his belly as best he could with his remaining arm. It was considerably more difficult, but he managed to keep his balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could start heading over though, Kurama spoke up. \"Say, Naruto? Since we're both probably gonna crash as soon as we like down, there's just...something I wanna say to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Naruto blinked. \"What is it, Kurama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama took a deep breath...then fixed Naruto with one of the warmest, most appreciative smiles he'd ever seen. \"Thanks, Naruto. Thanks for giving me such a great time, for such an epic reunion feast, and, well...\" he beamed, squinting his eyes shut. \"...thanks for just being such a great friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his chest hitch, Naruto nonetheless managed a smile. \"Hey, same to you, pal.\" He yawned loudly. \"Now, I dunno about you, but I'm about ready to call it a night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Naruto began lurching toward the side of the bed, Kurama making a beeline for the bed itself. The young fox reached his destination first; reaching an arm out, he swiped some of the blankets off the bed and onto the floor, as well as one of the pillows. Naruto gave his friend an appreciative smile as he reached the area...before falling to the blanketed floor, maneuvering onto his back and flopping down, engorged belly sticking high up in the air. Seconds later, his eyes were shut, and he was snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling warmly at the sight, Kurama took that as his cue to flop back onto his bed as well. Before succumbing to sleep, though, he concentrated, Requipping one last thing into his waiting hands. Once it fully materialized, he held it up, gazing at it with undeniable fondness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, put simply, a plushie of some kind of three-tailed yellow fox with squinted-shut eyes. It was quite obviously well-loved; the fur showed signs of wear and tear, a few singe marks dotted the edges, and there were a few stitches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smiled warmly, his eyes growing slightly misty. <i>Our last big hurrah in Termina before I left...I'll never forget it as long as a I live...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he tucked the plush under one arm and hugged to to his chest, finally shutting his eyes. As he succumbed to sleep, the young fox half-consciously grabbed one of his tails, hugged it to his chest, and placed the tip in his mouth, gently suckling on it as, finally, sleep claimed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The efforts of their day combined with just the utter fullness both youths had sustained had knocked both Naruto and Kurama out a good, long, very long while.  Hours just ticked and ticked by from well into the evening and night, until well into the morning.  Courtesy of both living very active and energy burning lives, they had metabolisms that worked double time compared to anyone who wasn't a ninja or a member of a rag tag group of mages.  As a result, those hours allowed their stomachs to slowly but surely work off the vast...vast meals they had both consumed in their feet numbing feeding frenzy, until they were perfectly flat and trim once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as the morning continued to tick away, Naruto's eyes gradually began to flicker, just barely squinting open.  Groaning a tired groan, the teen rubbed his eyes groggily, still laying on the floor, before his hand fell down on his bare stomach.  His shirt had been hiked high from how bloated his belly was prior.  After several, food coma induced hours of digestion, however, it was once again back to its' concave flat form, with his belly button once again returning to its' innie position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Mmm, man was that an awesome feast...\" he muttered sleepily to himself with a grin as he gave his stomach a hearty pat.  As he did, though, he noticed something else resting against him.  Something <i>fuzzy</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing to his eyes, Naruto's heart immediately hitched when he discovered the dozing young fox snuggled into Naruto's left arm and resting peacefully with his tail and Keaton plush tucked in his chest and the tip of his tail in his muzzle, and with his other arm, Kurama had unwittingly wrapped it around Naruto's shoulders.  Like Naruto, Kurama's orange furred belly had returned to its' perfectly flat state, and was equally as exposed as Naruto's, due to his past stuffing escapades hiking his pajama shirt waaaaay up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the days of Termina, whenever Naruto had found a certain young kit snoozing with his tummy exposed, Naruto would mischievously flutter his fingers all across and jolt the kit awake with a flurry of laughter.  This time, however, that thought hadn't entered his normally immature mind.  Kurama simply looked so peaceful...so content...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Naruto still had Hunter's rectangular device...right, a camera...this would have been a picture perfect moment.  Smiling warmly, he gently ruffled the top of Kurama's head, causing his smile to widen beneath his tail as he nuzzled closer to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, the young fox squinted, and his own eyes began to slowly flutter open with a big, hearty yawn, which released his tail from his mouth and grip.  Smacking his chops, Kurama's eyes had eventually opened as he looked straight ahead...and immediately, his eyes widened with shock as he stumbled back nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Naruto!  Uhh, h-hi, I...uhhh, I-\"  Kurama yelped as he looked down and realized his plush was still in his arms.  Almost comically, his face reddened like a cherry beneath his orange fur as he smiled a nervous smile, sat upright, and hid the plush behind his back.  \"S-so, errrr....d-did'ja sleep well...??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the young Tailed Beasts' surprise, however, Naruto sat up, wrapped his arm around Kurama's shoulders, and tugged him back down, pulling him in close with a grin.  Still blushing, Kurama scratched his cheek and said, \"S-sorry, h-heh...I move around a lot in my sleep, sometimes, and I guess, subconsciously, I just felt more comfortable-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuddlin' with y'er big bro?\"  Naruto finished with a laugh, before gently nudging Kurama closer.  \"C'mon, kiddo, you should know by now that'cha never got any reason to be embarrassed or apologize to me for anything.  Hell, this almost feels like back when you were a kit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Kurama nodded back.  \"H-heh, a lil bit...\"  Kurama replied, before his grin grew more at ease as he glanced down at Naruto's stomach and gave it a few light pats.  \"'Cept this was my bed more times than any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed and nodded.  \"And man, did'ja keep me warm.\"  The two laughed aloud for a good moment until Kurama's initial shock and embarrassment faded all but entirely.  Smiling warmly, he nuzzled closely to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I guess...subconsciously, being with you again just...just felt too good to be true...like I was dreaming again.  So, I guess I just needed...needed to be sure you were real...\"  Kurama explained with a sigh, before looking up at Naruto and softly adding \"...I can't even begin to describe how long I've missed you, big brother...how glad I am that you're really here...\"  Kurama then hugged Naruto tightly, smiling warmly as he squinted his eyes shut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto simply smiled and hugged the young fox right back with one arm.  \"I'll always be here for ya, lil bro...one way or another...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Kurama felt himself getting a bit glossy eyed, but it subsided.  He was just happy to be with his best friend...his true family again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the two sat up, as Naruto smiled back at Kurama and said, \"Well, I dunno about'chu, but now that the sun's up, I'm ready to seize the day!\"  As Naruto said that, he stood upright, and immediately, Kurama burst into a fit of giggles...since Naruto's pants immediately fell off from being torn up, exposing his boxers.  Face flushing, the young blonde immediately reached down and held them back up.  \"...Errr...after a change of clothing, perhaps...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama was still snickering as Naruto hopped into the restroom to change.  Glancing down at himself, he smiled and said, \"Eh, may as well change outta my PJ's while I'm at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the young fox stood up...and thanks to foresight, held his unbuttoned and unzipped shorts up with one hand.  Squinting his eyes shut, he concentrated as his PJ's began to glow bright.  In a flash, they were replaced by a black long sleeved shirt with one sleeve torn, leaving his right arm bare and exposing a black wrist band like before.  Over that shirt, he now wore a red vest, and white baggy trousers with a red sash wrapped around the waist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's better,\" Kurama said with a toothy, 'Fairy Tail' grin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, Naruto emerged from the bathroom, dressed in an orange T-Shirt with a red Konoha Leaf symbol proudly bared on his chest, black trousers, and his traditional headband.  \"Well, Kurama?  Whadduya feel like doin' now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama glanced out the window and said, \"Well...it's a really nice day out.  I wouldn't mind walkin' around the village.  H-heh, course, I'll hafta change into my disguise so we don't face any-err...problems, heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's smile softened as he nodded and shook his head.  Catching this, Kurama smiled in an assuring manner to his buddy and said, \"It's no problem, Naruto.  Really.  I know people can't help but be afraid of me here.  Long as I'm with'cha, I don't care how I look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Naruto smiled as Kurama slugged his arm playfully and concentrated again.  This time, his entire body began to glow, until, with a great flash, Naruto covered his eyes, only to pull them back and discover that same, red haired preteen he met at the ramen eating contest, dressed in the exact same attire he wore prior.  \"Heh, y'know what's funny?\"  Kurama said.  \"Even though this is just a disguise...it's...kinda how I pictured I'd look if I were ever human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled and wrapped his arm around the younger 'boys' neck and playfully ruffled his head, earning a laugh from Kurama.  \"However ya look, y'er still gonna be my favorite lil fuzzball,\" Naruto said, ruffling Kurama's head playfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Still...\" Naruto began, \"...I really wish ya didn't have to hide yourself.  It just ain't fair, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama thought for a moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...there is ONE way we could really hang out without having to worry about disguises or people freaking out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glanced at his young friend curiously and asked, \"Huh?  Whadduya mean, kiddo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing the back of his head, Kurama chuckled to himself, as if debating to ask what he was going to ask, then finally...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Say Naruto,\" Kurama began, a smile slowly turning the side of his mouth up, \"I never DID tell ya how I got to this world, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked, a bit confused at the sudden change of subject. \"N-no; you just said Hunter wasn't involved...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled. \"Nope. Would ya like to hear how?\" At Naruto's confused expression, he chuckled. \"Trust me, I'm goin' somewhere with this...\" Naruto was still confused, but nonetheless nodded. Seeing he had his friend's attention, the disguised fox went on. \"Well, I was hanging out in the East Forest-that's a forest outside of Magnolia Town, where the Guild's located-, relaxing under a nice, shady tree and curled up with a few good books...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Books?\" Naruto blurted in surprise. At this, Kurama flushed a bit. \"Err....yeah,\" he added, scratching the back of his head. \"Since I got to Fiore, I've, erm, become a bit of a bookworm, heh heh...\" Naruto said nothing in response, but instead gave a big smile to Kurama, replacing his confused expression. Upon seeing this, Kurama smiled, his shyness abating. \"Anyway, I was right in the middle of a really good chapter when a Gorian ambushed me...\" At Naruto's alarmed expression, he giggled. \"Basically a giant, talking monkey with a real nasty attitude. Don't worry, they're more nuisances than anything, but they can get a bit gutsy from time to time.\" Kurama grinned. \"Needless to say, I kicked its ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's chest swelled with pride. It was one thing to see his little buddy again, but to see him so self-confident...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama winced. \"Although, err, I MAY have gone a bit overboard when I finally sent him packing....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Overboard?\" Naruto repeated, somewhat dreading what he'd hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama gulped. \"Erm... Well, I fired a Tailed Beast Ball at the ground near where he was standing, not enough to actually hit him, but enough to send him flying...don't worry, they're pretty sturdy. I guarantee you, the worst he suffered was a nasty bump on the head and a bruised ego.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened at this, remembering how, as a mere kit, Kurama had unintentionally obliterated a shooting gallery using that very same technique.  He must have really refined it if he could fire it with that sort of precision...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama laughed nervously. \"Of course, I, erm, kinda failed to take into account that my books were still in the vicinity, partially 'cause they're protected with magic seals...they were from the Fairy Tail Library, see...and, well, while the books themselves were intact...\" He scratched the back of his head. \"...my chakra musta had a weird reaction with the magic seals protecting the books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. \"Weird reaction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama sighed. \"Uh, yeah. It sorta, um, ripped open a hole in the dimensional fabric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHAT caught Naruto's attention. \"...what?\" He asked, blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama winced. \"Y-yeah; I mean, I had no idea what it was at first, so I ran back to the guild, told Makarov-he's the Guildmaster- and showed him the tear. I explained what happened, and he kinda walked right into it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He WALKED into something like that?\" Naruto exclaimed, eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disguised fox gave a wink. \"Hey, I said everyone at the guild was a little quirky, didn't I? Anyway, next thing I knew, a really, REALLY ugly-looking creature-it was kinda like a human, except it was bald, had razor sharp teeth, and had swords in its arms, if you can believe it-came flying through, all beaten up and unconscious, and Makarov just came walking back through.\" He grinned. \"Hey, he's the Guildmaster for a reason.\" He coughed, resuming his tale. \"Anyhow, it didn't take much for us to deduce that it was an interdimensional rip after that. Of course, I was afraid of something even WORSE coming through, so I kinda commented on how I kinda wished it opened to someplace a little less terrifying...and then wouldn't you know it, Palutena walked through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. \"Palutena...?\" His eyes widened as he remembered. \"Isn't that that goddess friend of Hunter's who told us you...\" he faltered a bit. \"...had to leave for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest lurched at the reminder, but Kurama nonetheless nodded. \"Y-yeah; she looked around, really surprised, saw me, and said, 'Oh, hi, Kurama! You've grown up a bit, haven't you? Sorry I can't stay to catch up, but I have to be somewhere else...' then walked right back into the portal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes lidded themselves halfway-shut; from what he remembered of the goddess, she had been remarkably casual, sassy, and even a bit klutzy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama went on. \"Anyway, I had an idea, and then after testing it out a few times, me 'n the Master came up with a theory; since the rip was partially of my creation, I could 'tell' it where to open up...\" At this, he looked up and fixed Naruto with a warm smile. \"Needless to say, you were the first thing that came to mind when we realized that.\" Naruto's heart hitched, and he had to fight back the urge to run up and wrap his friend in a tight embrace. \"Anyway, I got the Master's OK, I 'told' the portal to open to this world, and, well...here I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes were wide. \"That's...that's how you got here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disguised fox shrugged. \"Well, I had to do some wandering around, some asking-I was a little nervous that I'd get found out, but I've gotten really good at suppressing my chakra, so as not to set off any alarm bells-but eventually, I heard about this village having a ramen-eating contest, and, well, considering how much we both love ramen, it was a no-brainer.\" He beamed, folding his arms behind his head. \"Ya know...the portal's only a little ways away from the village. If ya want...\" he gulped. \"...you could, erm, come to Fiore with me for a bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened; THAT'S what he'd been leading up to. \"Come...come to Fiore with you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama shrank back a bit. \"I-I mean, if you don't want to, it's fine; I-I'm not gonna force ya...\" <i>Stupid, stupid, stupid! You just up and asked him to leave his world behind? Why couldn't you have at least told him outri---</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted by Naruto reaching an arm out,wrapping them around his shoulders, and playfully tugging him close. The blonde beamed down at his young friend. \"Hell, are you kidding? I'd love to hang out with you in your world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes shot wide open, and his heart began hammering in his chest. \"You...you don't mind leaving this world behind for a bit...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed, playfully ruffling Kurama's 'hair'. \"Hey, this village is a ways away from Konoha; I'm not expected back for a week or so. And you said time moves slower in your world, right? Something tells me we'll have plenty of time to hang out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama stared at Naruto for a few moments, completely unsure of what to say....then, with a great whoop, jumped up and wrapped his arms around Naruto's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the two were fully packed and on the road, well on their way from the village. Naruto, for once not minding not being in front, followed Kurama's lead, eagerly allowing the disguised Kyubi to lead them to the portal. All the while, they chatted and caught up, and Naruto found himself getting both shocked and incredibly proud of just how much Kurama had developed his skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, he'd discovered a new, natural ability; specifically, the ability to sense emotions in those around him. He was more attuned to, and preferred, positive emotions, but he could detect negative emotions just as well. (Of course, Kurama being Kurama, he didn't use that ability unless the situation called for it or he had permission.) When Naruto had given him permission to 'scan' him, Kurama had almost stumbled from the sudden rush of joy, elation, and pride he felt from the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor another, he'd greatly refined his Tailed Beast Ball abilities, to the point where he could control its size, shape the blast before he fired it, and various other 'cool things'. When asked what these things were, Kurama had merely winked and teasingly replied \"You'll see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was how much of a scrapper he'd become. Naruto had listened, awestruck and proud, as Kurama described accounts of him tangling with wild creatures like the Gorian, beating the crap out of bandits, and even engaging in battle with mages who sought to use their talents for harmful or selfish gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And he's still the same, sweet kid anyway...</i> Naruto thought fondly as his friend went on to brightly describe some of the more mundane tasks he nonetheless enjoyed: helping civilians with a monster problem, assisting in both the demolition and renovation of small buildings, and generally just helping people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two arrived in a heavily-wooded area. They trudged through it a bit, before reaching what appeared to be a thick wall of foliage. This prompted Kurama to exclaim, \"Alright, here we are!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked, staring at the wall. \"I...don't see an interdimensional rip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled. \"That's 'cause its behind the vines and stuff, silly.\" Doing a quick 'scan' to confirm there was no one else around, he first dispelled his disguise, reverting to his natural form in a flash of light, then pulled the vines aside. \"Here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gaped at the sight; it was, quite simply, a shapeless 'rip' in space, separating itself from its surroundings by blue, unearthly glow it emitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, that's weird,</i> Naruto thought, shuddering a bit at the sight of it. He looked toward Kurama. \"You sure that thing's safe, little buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned, nodding his head. \"Absolutely!\" His tails swished eagerly behind him. \"I tested it out, remember? This thing'll take us to Fiore, no problem!\" At that, the portal brightened a bit, apparently having been 'told' where to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaming, Kurama ran up beside Naruto, looking up at him. \"Ready, big brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, still staring at the portal, gulped, fighting back his reservations. \"Ready whenever you are, little brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashing one another grins, they stepped through the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, for his part, was surprised by just how smooth the transition was; one second, they'd been in a thick, overgrown forest, but as soon as they stepped through the portal, their surroundings had changed to a brightly-lit glen in the middle of a verdant forest. It was almost like stepping through a door, actually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Naruto muttered, glancing around. There were trees and foliage all around him, many of which he'd never seen in his world, strange birds and creatures flying and scuttling about, and a sort of electricity in the air that Naruto couldn't quite put his finger on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at his friend, Kurama grinned. \"Feeling a little funny there?\" At Naruto's nod, he chuckled. \"Ah, don't worry, that's just the ambient magic in the air; you'll get used to it.\" A knowing smirk lifted up the side of his muzzle. \"Of course, if ya think <i>that's</i> something....\" Then, without warning, he darted off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?!\" Naruto exclaimed, shocked. \"K-Kurama, wait up!\" With that, he began running after the young Nine-Tails actually struggling to keep up with him. No wonder, when he was running on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kurama, stop!\" Naruto shouted. \"What are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ran, he didn't notice that more sunlight was beginning to peek through the treetops, nor that they were becoming thinner and thinner. It wasn't until Kurama suddenly skidded to a stop that Naruto put on the brakes. As his friend stood back on his hind legs, Naruto looked down at him, shocked. \"Kurama, what the hell was...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of replying, Kurama grinned cheekily and pointed a finger downwards. Curious, Naruto followed it....and gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore them was a rather large city, multiple buildings of vibrant color and varying size and structure, none of which he'd ever seen back home, jutted skyward. A river ran through the area, dividing the town into parts, with mountains at the sides of the town. And, at the end of it, there was a magnificent building, behind which sat a blue, glimmering ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning widely as Naruto's jaw dropped open, Kurama spread his arms. \"Naruto...\" he began, his tails swishing in anticipation. \"...welcome to Magnolia Town.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take long for Naruto and Kurama to make their way down the hills and into town, and as vast as it looked from afar, for Naruto, it was exponentially more lively and colorful up close and personal.  The teen was utterly awestruck by what he had seen.  Never in his life had Naruto ever bared witness to buildings of such architecture and scale, surrounded by such towering and lush mountains.  For him, it was like something out of a picture book.  And as Naruto gaped at the sights all around him, Kurama watched and smiled with amusement as his friends' bewilderment.  He'd seen that look on currently on his 'big bros' face multiple times...worn that very look himself whenever venturing to new places, such as his first glimpse of Termina as a kit, or even his own first time in this place that would become his new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite a sight indeed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap...\" Naruto muttered, still taken back.  \"This place is...this place is somethin' else...!\"  Laughing, Kurama grinned and folded his arms behind his head as his head tilted skyward.  \"Yep!  Sure is, big brother!  Course, the true heart of any town or city isn't just the buildings or even the landscape, but the people who occupy it.\"  As the young Tailed Beast said that, Naruto could truly see the busy and active townsfolk all around him, lively...and happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if on cue, a few of those very townsfolk caught wind of Kurama and his best friend and immediately smiled and waved at the young fox, who more than happily returned their waves, as casual as could be.  Well, except one particular merchant, whom Kurama seemed especially sheepish around, apologizing about cabbages and carts, before moving on...but that was promptly met with more friendly faces, light hearted and casual greetings, and a lot of thanks and praise.  This sight filled Naruto's heart with that all too familiar warmth as he glanced back at Kurama, who beamed back up at Naruto and said, \"Quite a change'uh pace from back in Konoha, huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could reply, a young boy; no older than seven or eight years old, rushed up to Kurama eagerly, catching Naruto by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh!  Mister Kurama!  Mister Kurama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked, seeing and hearing his young friend being addressed as 'Mister' was yet another change of pace.  But then again, it HAD been a few years for Kurama, and the young kit he knew had grown quite a bit.  Kurama, on the other hand, just smiled at the young boy.  \"Oh, hiya, Aito!  Good to see you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys' face lit up as he eagerly reached into his pouch and grabbed a small bag of what sounded like jewels towards Kurama, once again surprising Naruto as the boy; Aito, said, \"My mommy wanted me to give this to ya!  To thank you for helping Daddy after that monster tried to hurt him up in the mountains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kurama just chuckled to himself and shook his head as he gently ruffled the boys head and said, \"Tell your mom that's really kind of her, and I appreciate it big time, but she doesn't owe me a single jewel.  I'm just glad I was there when I was.\"  He then grinned a bit more impishly and added, \"Besides, that turnover apple pie she baked was <i>waaaaaaay</i> more than thanks enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy giggled while Naruto just laughed softly.  Then, the boy rushed up and gave Kurama a big hug, catching Naruto off guard for a moment, but not Kurama, who seemed ready and happily embraced the young boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for bringing my daddy home safe'n sound, Mister Kurama...I hope that, someday, I can be a hero like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's heart swelled with what would only be described as immeasurable pride.  It was one thing to hear of Kurama's escapades and adventures of helping the townsfolk, but to actually see the impact his young friend had on so many others, to see how humble, caring and genuinely selfless he was, and how much these people truly appreciated that, left Naruto simply overjoyed and proud to see how far his young friend had come along...how truly RIGHT he was for this world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama just grinned softly and with a light chuckle, said, \"Hehe, hey, that's what Fairy Tail's here for, right?  Now go on, don't wanna keep y'er mom waitin', lil guy!\"  The boy smiled widely with his eyes squinted shut as he looked up at Kurama and nodded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, see ya, Mister Kurama!\"  said the boy as he scampered off, leaving Kurama chuckling and rubbing the back of his head as he turned back to Naruto.  \"H-heh, like I sayin'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just smiled warmly at the young fox and rested his hand atop Kurama's shoulder.  \"I know I'm soundin' like a broken record here...but I'm proud of you, kiddo...really...I mean...not only didja manage to truly make this place a home, but you've grown so much as a person.  You're mature, smart, kind, strong, brave...and you're a real hero to these people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama just smiled warmly at Naruto and simply said, \"I learned from the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd almost immediately, that warmth in Naruto's chest grew warmer and brighter, but before he could comment any further, something else caught Kurama's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-Happy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked.  \"Uhhh, yeah, course I a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, sir!  Welcome back!\"  called out a much smaller voice.  Naruto turned...and immediately gaped at what he saw.  It appeared to be a talking blue cat...with wings, flying straight towards the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...is that...is that a talking flying cat...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled and playfully slugged Naruto's arm.  \"Happy's no cat, he's an exceed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Naruto blinked.  \"...What...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing the back of his head, Kurama just chuckled and said, \"H-heh, well, see the difference between-\"  Suddenly, Kurama's ears twitched as something else caught his attention.  \"Wait a sec, how come Natsu isn't with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floating blue 'exceed' rubbed the back of his own head a bit sheepishly and said, \"Natsu and Gray were fighting about...I don't remember what...and Ms. Erza happened to walk in on the whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Naruto could have sworn Kurama had gone ghost white beneath his orange fur as the young fox let out a small 'eep' before Happy went on.  \"And before she could really let Natsu have it, he sent me away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When were ya plannin' on headin' back?\" Kurama asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...After Natsu and Gray are done screaming for their lives...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto himself shuddered at what horrors this 'Erza' could be putting Kurama's fellow mages through.  But Kurama just laughed and said, \"Ah, I'm sure it ain't gonna be THAT bad...m-maybe...but I was actually on my way back to show-OH!\"  Kurama slapped his own forehead before immediately shifting his focus on Naruto.  \"How could I be such a ditz?  Happy?  Remember how I told ya about my best friend in the whole world who's the only reason I'm even standin' here right now?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama's smile became one of great pride and gratitude as he turned to Naruto and said, \"Here he is!  My best friend and my 'big bro', Naruto Uzumaki!  And Naruto?  This is Happy, Natsu's exceed, and a great pal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the craziness seemingly unfolding, Naruto smiled back at the exceed and said, \"We don't get many...exceeds where I come from, but it's really nice to meet'cha!\"  The exceed saluted at Naruto and smiled, \"Aye!  So that's where you've been all week, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, what can I say?  The kid works fast for-all who what now?\"  Naruto's mind scrambled as Kurama just laughed and nudged Naruto playfully.  \"Haha, remember what I told'ja, big bro?  Time's way faster here than it is in Konoha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, Naruto was still trying to wrap his head around that, but he simply accepted it and nodded for the time being.  Kurama, meanwhile, turned his attention back to Happy and said, \"I was actually on my way back to introduce Naruto to the rest'uh the guild.  Wanna tag along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy shifted about nervously and said, \"...I'd...prefer to wait it out...at least until Erza is done being...Erza...\"  But Kurama just laughed playfully and said, \"Ah, c'mon, it ain't gonna be that bad.  And, hey, if it is?  I'll keep ya safe'n sound, I promise!\"  Sighing, Happy reluctantly nodded and floated alongside the two as they made their way back to the guild.  \"But if we hear any bloodcurdling screams, we're turning in the opposite direction and never looking back,\" Happy warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I second that notion...\" Naruto added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama just laughed and nodded to the two.  \"Haha, deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went on, Kurama continued to fill Naruto in on how things in Fiore and Magnolia Town worked, now with Happy's help, who also helped Kurama explain more about the Fairy Tail guild and all the members, as well as some of their own individual quirks here and there.  To Naruto, they certainly sounded like a rowdy bunch...arguably even more so than Naruto and his own circle of friends and comrades, but they still sounded like a great bunch of people, and if Kurama liked them, then frankly, that was enough for Naruto.  Mainly, he was surprised to hear just how much he really had in common with Kurama's main pal and mentor over at the guild, Natsu Dragneel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the inn, Naruto made a crack about this Natsu guy taking his place as Kurama's pal and teacher, but from the sound of things, Natsu truly had stepped up and really taken Kurama under his proverbial wing.  But that hadn't filled Naruto with any jealousy of any kind.  Rather, he felt more and more eager to meet this mage, to express his deepest gratitude for giving his 'lil bro' a home and a family...and...if Naruto was being COMPLETELY honest, cause he sounded like a pretty fun guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time passed as the trio continued down their way to the guild, until eventually, they made it...only to be greeted by what sounded like a helluva commotion inside.  Both Naruto and Happy gulped nervously as Kurama stepped up and said, \"Don't worry, I'll see what's goin' on inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the young fox reluctantly opened the great doors of the guild, expecting the absolute worst...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, whadduya think, Naruto?\"  Asked Kurama as he beamed down at the portrait-like scene before him.  His smile dropped slightly when Naruto hadn't responded.  \"Naruto?\"  A bit concerned, the preteen fox turned back towards his friend, and his smile returned full force, seeing the elder teen STILL gaping at the sight.  \"Hehe, yeah, I was pretty much the same way first time Hunter took me here.  And the sight is nothing compared to what this town really has to offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Naruto mutters, \"...It's...beautiful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it though?\"  Grinning, Kurama slugs Naruto in the arm and added, \"...Yknow, if ya WANT, there's really no reason we can't take some time to just hang out up here and enjoy the scene.  The Guild isn't going anywhere after all.\"  Naruto, finally shaking off his initial trance, smiles back at the younger creature and wraps his arm around his shoulders and tugs him close playfully.  \"Sounds like a plan, kiddo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the two sat side by side, marveling at Magnolia and the accompanying surrounding mountains, lush with green, from afar.  Naruto kept one hand planted on the ground beneath him for support while his left arm was still wrapped around the young Tailed Beasts' shoulders.  The two simply sat there for some time.  Kurama smiled warmly at the sight and liveliness of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know something, Naruto?  I've come up here at least once virtually every day I can.  Sometimes with Natsu and Happy, sometimes by myself, and this sight never stops amazing me...never stops making me grateful for everything you and the others did to give me a place like this to call home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish I could'a been here to share it with'cha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but really, you can't leave behind your life back in Konoha...all your friends...or even all the people who depend on ya.  Besides,\" he grinned impishly as he patted Naruto on the back and added, \"...now that I know the cross dimensional traversing works, there's no reason ya can't come by'n visit every so often, right?  Especially with the way time works here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young blond just smiled back and rocked the young fox playfully.  \"I like the way you think, kiddo.\"  Naruto's smile grew warmer as he added, \"...Still, I'm just glad this Natsu guy was here for ya.  I know I've said it a trillion times, but, seeing what you've grown up into, I couldn't be prouder...and I'm glad this guy was here to help steer you on the path you've taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smiled warmly at his 'big brother' and wrapped one arm around the elder teen, tugging him right back in a brief hug.  \"Yeah, I owe a lot to Natsu.  He's a great, funny guy, an excellent hands on teacher, and really, one of my best friends...but you'll always be my BEST best friend...and my 'big bro.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just laughed and ruffled the young fox's fuzzy head playfully.  \"Ah, I know that, fuzzball.  Trust me, I'm glad he's such an amazing friend to you, and I hope you only continue to make more and more friends, and with a bubbly personality like yours, I doubt that'd be a problem, hehe.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two chuckled softly for a moment, before Naruto asked, \"So, what was it like, being taught things like magic?  It sounds pretty similar to how I was taught to channel chakra, and how I've always been trained in various forms of ninjutsu.  Heck, we even have teams and go on mission together like you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't say we go on missions.  It's more or less job postings we get in the Guild Hall.  Do a job, collect jewels, rinse repeat.  Sometimes, it's reconstruction work, sometimes, it's fending off monsters, or fighting bandits or rival Guilds, or anything along those lines.  It can get pretty competitive actually, but it's always a blast, hehe.  And Natsu, because of how experienced he is with his particular skills, was able to understand my abilities, and figured out how to translate that into his techniques, allowing him to teach me point by point how to use Fire Magic and using my Chakra to fuel that.  Really, he was an amazing teacher, because all throughout, he was showing me the ropes, was always patient when I screwed up, and was there for me every step of the way.  See, he...he never needed time to get used to me being around or anything like that like I was initially scared of.  Literally as soon as Hunter introduced me to him, Natsu just treated me like I was part of the Guild...part of the family...they all did really.  H-heh, but Lucy...?  Ohhh boy, when Natsu first introduced me to her...I don't think I'd ever heard anyone make such a high pitched squeal...or been squeezed as tight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned impishly at that and gave the young kyuubi a playful squeeze with his arm.  \"Well, you WERE a freakin' adorable lil kit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama rubbed the back of his head as his cheeks flushed a bit before softening a bit.  \"H-heh, guess I was, huh...but that's part of what makes this place so special to me.  I wasn't something to be feared...or something to be treated as different or even weird.  Just one of the guys, hehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Kurama looked out distantly yet fondly back at Magnolia Town...reflecting on all this wonderful place has given him, all the friends he's made, all the adventures he'd been fortunate enough to go on, but most of all...on his close friend and mentor, who had to taught him so much and been there to guide him at every step of the way; Natsu Dragneel...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto's slumbering form twitched, his arms and legs sprawled about every which way. Somewhere, at the edges of his subconscious, a thought registered. <i>Mmmf...smells nice...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning had come, and, owing to his active metabolism, Naruto's grossly swollen belly had completed digested back to its trim state, his navel returning to an innie. His clothes still bore the marks of his and Kurama's feast, the sides of his shirt being torn up and the front of his pants ripped open, exposing his undergarments. In between that and his sprawled position, his pants had slipped down further and his battered shirt was still riding up high, exposing his flat belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snored a bit, a bit of drool at the corner of his mouth. Again, though, his nose twitched. <i>Mmmm...whazz...whazz tha' smell...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his eyes flew open...only for him to squeeze them shut as the morning light hit them. Grumbling, he sat up, his shirt falling back down over his torso. He sniffed again...and his mouth began to water. <i>Oh man...what's that smell...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't just one smell, truthfully; it was several deep, rich smells that permeated the room...all of which smelled absolutely fantastic. There were sweet smells, cheesy smells, savory smells, salty smells...all mixing into a truly delectable aroma. Still, after that initial shock, he didn't want to open his eyes just yet....wait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned a bit. <i>Is...is somebody humming?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly-very slowly-he blinked his eyes open, slowly letting the light in. From the blurry image this presented, there was someone in the kitchen...and yes, they were most definitely humming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrain waking up a bit more, realization seeped into Naruot's head. <i>K...Kurama...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head a bit, he blinked several more times, clearing his vision...and when the image before him came into focus, he gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama was in the kitchen, humming merrily and dancing a bit as he...Naruto squinted to make sure he was seeing this right...<i>cooking</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarbed in his pajamas and what appeared to be a long, red apron (though it was a bit hard to tell from the back), he shook his rump a bit as he went about, scrambling eggs, flipping pancakes and french toast, and various other things, occasionally twirling from place to place. What was more, though...he was doing many of these things with his <i>tails</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, as he twirled from place to place, one of his tails would be doing something. A couple were wrapped around the handles of several of the pans, flipping and mixing them, while still others dipped their tips into several of the pots and brought themselves to Kurama's mouth, where he would taste the contents. Depending on the contents, he would either nod in satisfaction or have a thoughtful look on his face, in which case another one of his tails would grab something, like salt or some other condiment, and shake a bit into the requisite pot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued gaping. <i>Huh....wha....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to his friend's shock...or even to the fact he was awake, in fact...Kurama continued dancing, humming, and cooking. Seeing this, Naruto's eyes wandered to the table, and his eyes widened as he saw that there were already several plates on the table. There were sticky buns, sausage, jugs of milk, some cut-up fruit, and some bagels. And, as Kurama cooked, some of his unoccupied tails grabbed several empty plates, tossed them over to the table where they landed perfectly, then grabbed some pans in his tails and flipped them over his shoulder, where they landed effortlessly on the empty plates. He continued in this manner for a bit, until the table was creaking under a veritable breakfast buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...\" grinning, Kurama whirled around to face the table, folding his arms as he stared proudly at his work (and revealing that the apron was indeed a bright red with \"Fox says 'Time to Eat!'\" emblazoned on it in fancy white font), \"...that is a wrap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded in satisfaction...before his ears twitched, and he saw Naruto gaping at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACK!\" Yelping, Kurama jumped bit. \"N-Naruto, don't scare me like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Naruto mumbled, still trying to process what he'd seen....then, all of a sudden, it clicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurama,\" he began, \"what...what WAS that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing nervously, Kurama rubbed the back of his head. \"W-well, when I'm cooking, I kinda get a little animated, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no,\" Naruto cut in, shaking his head. \"I-I mean...you were <i>cooking</i>! When...when did that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned sheepishly. \"It's, uh, something I picked up in Fiore. A-as it turns out, I kinda have a talent for cooking.\" He shrugged. \"I-I mean, I'm nowhere near as good as Rocket, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares?\" Naruto cut in, startling the young fox a bit. \"Hell, if any of that stuff tastes HALF as good as it smells...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to a stop as something occurred to him. \"Wait...you made us breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama blushed a bit, looking away. \"W-well...I got up a little earlier than usual, and you were still sleeping, and I didn't wanna disturb you, s-so I figured I might as well make us some breakfast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's heart hitched a bit at the sincerity in that statement, and glanced at the table to shake it off. \"W-well, it looks like you really went all out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama looked back toward Naruto, his blush subsiding a bit. \"W-well, I wasn't sure what you wanted, s-so I made...everything I could think of, heh heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Naruto's heart hitched. This time, he shrugged it off by smirking. \"Well...I'd say everything sounds good.\" He grinned. \"And I MEAN everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's ears perked. \"Y-you really wanna go all out? This early in the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shrugged. \"Hey, like ya said, it's early, so we probably won't pass out after we've finished everything. Figure afterwards, we can relax, let everything digest...\" His smile turned warm. \"..and maybe you can tell me what you've been up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama's expression eased a great deal, and he smiled. \"Th-that sounds great!\" He beamed, undoing his apron. \"No time like the present, right?\" He set his apron to the side, walked over to the table, and plopped down. \"C'mon; dive on in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Naruto moved to get up. \"Don't mind if I do!\" He stood up...and his mangled pants promptly dropped to his ankles. His face lit up to the point it was practically glowing, and Kurama's paws flew to his mouth as he fought to stem the tide of explosive giggles that came forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh...you....wanna change clothes, first?\" Kurama managed, several cackles escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Naruto reached down and pulled his pants up. \"That might be a good idea....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill blushing, he shuffled off to change. Still giggling, Kurama  poured himself a glass of milk and loaded up his plate with eggs, bacon, and toast. He'd just finished spreading his butter when Naruto came back in, wearing a short-sleeved white t-shirt with a red flame spiral and navy blue trousers-in short, larger versions of the clothes Kurama had loved as a kit, and which he still owned appropriately-sized versions of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile on his face, Naruto walked over to the table, plopped down, and made his own plate, shoveling eggs and sausage on. He took a sniff. \"Oh man, Kurama, this really smells great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a bit, Kurama took a bite of his toast. \"W-well, let's hope it tastes good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Naruto forked up some eggs. \"Ah, don't worry about it, Kurama,\" he assured the fox, taking a mouthful and chewing. \"I'm sure it's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped suddenly, his eyes bulging. Slowly, he chewed some more, than swallowed. Worried, Kurama looked towards him. \"I-is it not good? Did I put too much salt, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Kurama knew what was going on, the elder teen Naruto was chugging through his eggs like he hadn\u2019t eaten in days.  Naruto\u2019s cheeks practically bulged outward comically from the sheer influx of eggs he was chewing down on, beaming as the perfect blend of salt and zesty lemon pepper coated Naruto\u2019s taste buds.  Kurama, meanwhile, merely watched, a bit taken back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Erm\u2026s-so\u2026does that mean you like it\u2026?\u201d the young fox asked, a bit tentatively and with an adorably hopeful expression on his face.  His long ears soon twitched as Naruto took a hearty gulp, causing that mouthful of scrambled eggs inside his mouth to form an equally comical bulge down his throat and disappear into his chest, and down into his flat, eager belly.  Smacking his chops clean, Naruto smiled down at Kurama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKurama, I just\u2026I mean\u2026I dunno how you did it, but those, right there?  Those were THE BEST scrambled eggs I\u2019ve ever eaten in my life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama\u2019s ears twitched again as he glanced up, legitimately surprised and said, \u201cR-Really\u2026?  You think so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou kiddin\u2019?  I KNOW so, kiddo!\u201d Naruto practically cheered, clearly energized fully, compared to his earlier groggy state.  \u201cSeriously, you scrambled everything just right.  Nothing tastes extra yolky.  Ya put just the right amount\u2019uh salt, and don\u2019t even get me STARTED on that lemon pepper surprise, that one caught me off guard in the best way possible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching his best friend go on, Kurama couldn\u2019t help but smile a warm, grateful smile at Naruto, before rubbing his bicep a bit bashfully.  \u201cH-heh, well, the lemon pepper, I just know most people like just a little bit of kick here and there, and I remembered you really loved zesty stuff.  Ramen, the roasted cuckoo, the list goes on, hehe.  Still, I\u2019m really glad you like it, Naruto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike it?  I LOVE it!  I\u2019d gush about it even more, but I just wanna\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than finish his sentence, Naruto opted to dig right in for more, scarfing down more and more of his eggs at a seemingly record pace.  Snickering with amusement, Kurama eventually grabbed his own fork and dug in, smiling at the flavor himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, you\u2019re right, things did come out nicely,\u201d the young tailed beast remarked, before digging in for more, albeit at a slower pace than Naruto, who, by the time Kurama had barely gotten half way into his eggs, had already demolished his.  Wiping his mouth clean, Naruto took a bite of some sausage, and just like before, his face went comically blissful at the flavor, much to Kurama\u2019s amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKurama, I\u2026just\u2026I don\u2019t even\u2026HOW are you this good at cooking??  I know it\u2019s only been a few years for you, but even then, you\u2019re still so young, but can cook better than most restaurants I\u2019ve been to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, now y\u2019er just being too nice,\u201d Kurama replied, once again, rubbing the back of his head bashfully after gulping down a hefty mouthful himself.  But Naruto shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m serious, this is AMAZING.  The cooking, the books, the talent, the new kickass lifestyle, I just\u2026\u201d  After a moment, Naruto\u2019s gleeful grin softened to a much gentler, brotherly smile as he added, \u201cYou\u2019ve come so far in such a short amount of time, and\u2026I just know, in my heart, you\u2019ll only go further and further in life, excelling and going on to do great things.  I\u2019m proud\u2019uh you, kiddo.  I just want you to know that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Kurama felt that warmth in his heart; gratitude, love and pride, all in one.  But this time, he simply smiled back at his best friend, then held out his fist and said, \u201cI had a great role model.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling despite himself, Naruto extended his own fist and bumped it playfully against Kurama\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long though, Naruto\u2019s grin turned mischievous as he said, \u201cNow, how \u2018bout we save the mushy stuff for later, yeah?  I\u2019m willin\u2019 to bet every single dish here tastes amazing\u2026and I aim to cram as much of it in my face as I can.\u201d  He then winked and added, \u201cwouldn\u2019t wanna be rude after all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Naruto once again resumed chowing down on sausage, and loving the taste.  Kurama grinned back at Naruto, chuckling softly before once again resuming his own breakfast, picking up the pace a bit as he did so.  Even he was impressed by how good everything turned out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two eventually got into the rhythm, cramming more and more food into their all too eager maws, and scarfing it down merrily, with Naruto stuffing especially more in his maw than Kurama.  Polishing off the rest of his sausage, Naruto grabbed some bacon, and chomped down heartily with a resounding CRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Somehow, some way, the little fuzzy tailed beast managed to get the bacon to just the PERFECT degree of crispy.  It practically shattered in Naruto\u2019s mouth with each hearty bite, not that he was complaining.  Rather, he was practically inhaling one strip after another, much to Kurama\u2019s pride as he scooped up some egg and bacon and went to town himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, I really DID outdo myself this morning, huh...</i> Kurama thought to himself, unable to suppress a grin of pride for his own work.  Oblivious to this, Naruto just kept wolfing down more and more of his breakfast.  Even Kurama was surprised by how fast the blond was putting everything away.  Not that he was surprised by how fast Naruto was eating.  After all, the teen's appetite was FAR past established to Kurama for a good long while now.  However, they weren't having an eating contest, to see who could pack away the most first.  Rather, it was simply breakfast, and Naruto was packing it away like it was the end of days.  Clearly, Kurama must've done SOMETHING right, which only reinforced that proud smile across the orange fox's muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping down another hefty mouthful, Naruto let out a little sigh of relief before once again wiping his mouth with his forearm and grinning down at Kurama as he said, \"Seriously, lil buddy, I swear, if you ever learn how to make ramen, then I'd probably be a beached whale if it's anywhere near as good as this stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickering, Kurama waved his paw dismissively and said, \"Ah, getting ramen right's been, well, a bit trickier.\"  He gave Naruto a knowing wink and added, \"What, you thought that hadn't crossed my mind?  Lest we forget that contest we had yesterday, SOME of us like them some ramen too...just saying...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just laughed and nodded to himself.  \"Alright, fair enough.  But hey, y'er a fast learner.  I'm sure you'll get the hang of it in no time at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, here's hoping, right?\" replied Kurama before grabbing his milk and taking an ample drink from his glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than drink, Naruto instead turned his attention to something he'd been eyeing for a while; the sticky buns.  Licking his chops, Naruto grabbed one and took a hefty bite, not even needing to wait to see if it was good.  Even still, his face lit up like it was Christmas morning.  It was amazing how sweet and gooey it tasted.  Without even finishing his first bite, Naruto eagerly took his second, then his third, chewing only momentarily before taking yet another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Kurama couldn't help but snicker at how much Naruto's cheeks were bulging as he gleefully chewed away at the vast amount of sweet pastry currently in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, storing for the winter, are we?\" joked the young fox, but Naruto was too enticed by the flavor to do much else besides roll his eyes playfully.  After a while, he took yet another hefty gulp to send the treat down his throat as he winced, thumping his chest a few times to help get it all down, before sighing with relief when it finally did.  \"Phew, h-heh, man, it's hard to stop when ya start with stuff this good.  Kurama, I ain't even trying to be nice here, I'm dead serious.  You could make a FORTUNE if you ever opened a restaurant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, I've actually been told that by a few people...ESPECIALLY Natsu, hehe.  But honestly, I prefer just making food for my friends.  It's more satisfying seeing people I care about enjoy what I make.  Plus, I get to actually enjoy it WITH them, instead of just in the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, yeah, I can imagine it'd be weird cooking something then sitting down with the customer, huh,\" joked Naruto, but nonetheless, the sincerity of Kurama's reasoning was just as endearing as always.  It only served to remind Naruto that Kurama was still his little buddy even after all the changes, new skills, and the time passed.  Nonetheless, his attention was once again beckoned by the aroma of the sticky bun still on his plate.  Needing no second heed, Naruto resumed scarfing it down until it was reduced to crumbs on a plate.  Crumbs Naruto licked clean before grabbing more food, all too eager to wolf down as much of what Kurama had cooked for them as he possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more time went on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Phew!\" Naruto exclaimed, setting his fork own and patting his stomach. \"I'm practically inhaling this stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, swallowing a bite of toast, giggled. \"Considering you've already wolfed down three plates, I can believe that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Naruto had powered through three plates of bagels, sausage, eggs, sticky rolls, and other goodies, and he showed no sign of slowing down, in spite of the slight curve that had formed under his shirt. Through it all, he had had a huge smile upon his face, something that had sent a warmth into Kurama's heart. <i>H-heh, guess he really DOES like my cooking, huh...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wiped his mouth with a sleeve. \"Damn straight, and I'm ready for more!\" He paused for a moment. \"Still...\" he smacked his lips a bit. \"...all those goodies kinda made me thirsty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned. \"Waaaay ahead of you.\" Grabbing one of the pitchers of milk on the table, he tugged it toward himself, raised one of his tails above the table, and began gathering a bit of chakra into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's contented expression turned to one of confusion. \"Huh? Kurama, what're you...\" He sputtered when the chakra leapt from his tail to the pitcher, hitting the milk and soaking into it. \"Uh, Kurama...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, giggling, grabbed the pitcher with a tail and held it near Naruto, who took it, albeit with a bemused expression. \"It's a little trick I learned when I was fooling around with my abilities. If I put a little bit of my chakra into a drink, it brings out the flavor and makes it super yummy!\" He laughed at the unspoken question. \"And no, I haven't put my chakra into any of the food. I've tried that before, and the results were kinda, ummm...\" he glanced away, blushing a bit. \"...explodey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. \"Ex...plodey...?\" He shook his head. \"W-wait, Kurama, your chakra's really strong. Are you sure that's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama beamed, folding his arms behind his head. \"Safe? Oh yeah, totally! Natsu and a whole bunch of my other guild-mates taste-tested it, and they said it was the best milk they'd ever had!\" He shrugged. \"Sure, some of the more reserved ones were a little more energetic for an hour or two, but its not like they were bouncing all over the place.\" He scratched his cheek sheepishly. \"Besides, you're pretty energetic as-is, so it shouldn't be much different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough still a bit unsure, Naruto smiled and poured himself a glass of the chakra-enhanced milk. \"Eh, well, if you say its fine, it's fine.\" With that, he raised the glass to his lips, paused...but at Kurama's look, took a sip....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and his eyes bugged out. Kurama smiled hopefully. \"Jury says....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Naruto downed the entire glass in one go, licked his chops...then picked up the pitcher of milk and began chugging it down. This went on for a good few seconds, and by the time Naruto slammed the pitcher down for a break, at least a quarter of it was depleted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blinked. \"So...you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto licked his lips, then turned to Kurama and grinned. \"Damn, Kurama, you weren't kidding! That chakra really DOES bring out the flavor!\" Kurama, blushing, grinned and folded his arms behind his head. \"I mean, its cold, really creamy, really refreshing, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Naruto stopped, an odd expression contorting his face. \"And I'm feeling kinda weird right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the smile fell from Kurama's face. \"Weird...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned. \"Y-yeah; I mean, it's kinda hard to describe, but I'm feeling sorta...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his eyes widened, and with a \"GAH!\", he fell sideways out of his chair and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes bugged out, and immediately, he rose out of his seat. \"Naruto!\" Hopping down, he rushed over to the other side of the table. <i>Kurama, you stupid idiot!</i> he berated himself as he made his way over. <i>He has the...other you inside him! Who knows what kind of reaction your chakra caused when he swallowed it? Stupid!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails swishing in worry, he finally reached Naruto's seat. \"Naruto!\" He looked down at where Naruto had fallen. \"Are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words immediately died in his throat as he beheld Naruto's prone form. <i>Wha....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost to compound his thought, Naruto groaned. \"Ughhhh.....\" He groggily sat up, rubbing the back of his head. \"That was...that was weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked his eyes open, and started a bit when he saw Kurama. \"Kurama, hey. What's...\" He paused when he saw Kurama's muzzle gaping wide open. \"...what's wrong?\" Something clicked suddenly in his head. \"Wait a second....what's that in front of my face?\" As his eyes crossed, another thing occurred to him. \"And...why do my ears feel like they're way higher than they should be?\" He winced. \"And why do the back of my pants feel so cramped.....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trailed off as he finally got a look at what was in front of his face: specifically, a <i>muzzle</i>. \"Wha...\" He brought both hands up to the muzzle to examine it further...only to gasp when he saw their current appearance. \"Wh-what the hell...?!\" His hands were now paws, albeit ones with extended digits to act as hands, almost like Hunter's had been, complete with pads and blunt claws. The paws themselves were covered in black fur. Stretching his arms in front of him, he paled as he saw the black fur ended at his elbows, becoming blonde fur from that point on. Right afterwards, his arms stretched to the top of his head, and he felt ears not unlike that of a dog sticking up out the top of his head. \"H-how...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked toward Kurama, who was now wincing rather guiltily. \"Kurama, what...\" he gasped for breath, starting to feel panic seep in. \"What the hell's going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama winced again. \"Erm....\" He faltered as he struggled for a way to explain what he was seeing, and failed. \"It, erm, might be easier to just show you.\" Concentrating, he Requipped a large, full-length mirror in a flash of light. Slowly, he turned it around so it faced Naruto...and the ninja gaped at the sight that met him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw before him was not a human, but an anthropomorphic fox, much as Hunter was an Anthropomorphic wolf. Much of his fur, including the fur covering the vulpine ears sticking out the top of his head, was the same blonde as his human hair, save for his feet and hand-paws, which were covered in black fur. In addition, the fur on the bottom of his vulpine muzzle was a creamy white that travelled down his chest and under his shirt; a quick, experimental lift revealed that his belly area was covered in white fur as well. As he was gaping at his white-furred something, something forced itself free out of the back of his pants with a FLOOF; looking back, he saw that he was now in possession of a large, bushy, blonde-furred tail with a white tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing this, he gaped at the tail for a while longer, before turning back to his reflection in the mirror. Staggering to his feet (and having difficulty doing so, owing to his new digitigrade legs), he stared at himself for while longer, not saying anything. Then....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Still all but hyperventilating. Naruto; still resembling a yellow furred, white bellied, humanoid fox, gaped down at his hand-paws, without words to properly express himself.  Kurama, meanwhile, stood forward, holding his paws forward, trying to be as assuring as he possibly could.  Unfortunately, the situation was trickier than most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Kurama\u2026what\u2026the hell\u2026!\u201d Naruto finally choked out, still in utter disbelief at his current form.  \u201cWhat happened?!  I-I\u2019m a freakin\u2019 FOX now???\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No!\u201d  Kurama insisted, before wincing and adding, \u201c\u2026w-well\u2026KINDA, but-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-KINDA?!  I CHANGED SPECIES!!!\u201d  Naruto blurted out in shock, eyes still practically bugging out of his head as he continued to process his new, animalistic form, heart still beating like a jackhammer.  \u201cKurama, t-this doesn\u2019t any sense!   What the hell happened??  HOW the hell did it happen?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know, I just\u2026I SWEAR I didn\u2019t know that would happen!  I-I just thought I was making your drink yummier!  Nothing else!\u201d  Kurama insisted, feeling steadily more nervous and guilty.  He hated seeing Naruto in such an uncertain state of shock, and so bewildered and fearful, especially when just mere moments before all this, they were having the time of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Kurama was kicking himself for being so careless with his powers.  He should have foreseen some strange side effects.  Or better yet, he should have just let the two enjoy their breakfast as originally planned.  Kurama found himself wishing he wasn\u2019t always so overly eager to spice things up, as this was hardly the first time his eagerness had landed him in trouble before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this wasn\u2019t the time for all that.  Right now, Kurana needed to be strong, especially given the circumstances.  \u201cJust\u2026trust me, this won\u2019t last, Naruto.  None of the effects from my energy have ever had permanent changes on anyone.  You don\u2019t gotta worry about being a fox man forever.  Trust me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, still trying to catch his breath, eventually let that news sit in as he nodded, still expression shock and fear and disbelief all at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026O-Okay\u2026\u201d Naruto began, trying to calm down, \u201c\u2026okay.  I mean, this\u2026this is freakin\u2019 NUTS, but\u2026I do trust you, kiddo.  So\u2026okay\u2026sure.  J-Just temporary, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight!\u201d  Kurama assured the elder fox, as he just nodded again, taking a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Alright, okay\u2026it\u2019s just for a lil while.  I can manage this, sure, yeah\u2026\u201d the blond fox remarked, to try and assure himself things would be fine as he slowly rose to his feet.  \u201c\u2026Just\u2026just gotta stay calm, try\u2019n-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, with his new digitigrade legs, Naruto; who has now and always been a biped, fell flat on his rump as soon as he stood.  Wincing, Kurama immediately rushed over to his friend to help him sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026W-What the hell??\u201d Naruto began, rubbing his backside in discomfort, before looking down at his legs and realizing what had happened.  \u201cCrap, I can\u2019t even WALK like this, can I\u2026urgh, whatever, no problem\u2026don\u2019t need to walk, I guess\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama wasted no time reaching over to Naruto and helping him up to his seat, where he once again sat before the table, unable to do much else.  Seeing Naruto this helpless to things, however, was steadily becoming too much for Kurama.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down shamefully, Kurama shook his head and said, \u201c\u2026Naruto, I\u2019m so sorry.  I-I didn\u2019t mean to do all this.  I SWEAR, if I knew adding some of my chakra to your drink would make you\u2026kinda like me, I never would\u2019a done it!  Honest!  I dunno how I could\u2019a been so stupid\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a moment, Naruto, who was steadily managing to calm himself, glanced down at the saddened young fox, then, instinctively, he wrapped an arm around the pre-teen Nine Tailed Beast, and tugged him close as he gently ruffled the young fox\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Hey, c\u2019mon, man, don\u2019t do that,\u201d Naruto insisted, voice more calmed.  \u201cIt was an accident, they happen, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut accidentally turning your best friend into a walking, talking FOX??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling a bit uneasily in agreement, Naruto nonetheless cleared his throat and shrugged as he said, \u201cHey, we live in a crazy age, kiddo.  It\u2019s not like this is even the weirdest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me, lest we forget the de-aging\u2026or those freaky magic masks from Termina?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in this situation, Kurama couldn\u2019t help but chuckle softly at the memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus, I mean, more I think about it, it\u2019s not like this is the WORST thing that could temporarily happen to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do ya mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, think about it.  I get to spend\u2026however long I\u2019m gonna be stuck like this, as another species.  I mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s muzzle lifted a bit as he sniffed the air, and licked his chops with a notable and toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor starters, my sense of smell is WAY enhanced.  I bet even more so than Dog Breath\u2019s,\u201d Naruto said with an impish grin.  \u201cAnd if your food smells even better than it already did, I bet it\u2019s gonna TASTE even better too, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in this situation, Kurama couldn\u2019t help but smirk knowingly as he gave Naruto a wink to confirm on that part.  \u201cNot only that,\u201d Kurama started, \u201cbut if you\u2019re like me, then that means your gonna probably be able to pack away more at a quicker pace than ya already do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, h-heh, suddenly being a Fox doesn\u2019t sound all that crazy after all, huh,\u201d Naruto remarked, before smiling a bit more softly and adding, \u201cn-not only that, but\u2026now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arm still wrapped around the young fox\u2019s shoulders, Naruto tightened his one armed hug just a bit as he jostled the younger fox to get his attention as he looked down at Kurama and added, \u201c\u2026Now, we actually do kinda look like brothers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken back by these last words, Kurama looked up at his \u2018big bro,\u2019 unsure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Somehow, Naruto always knew the right things to say, as almost immediately, Kurama felt himself get misty eyed, before wrapping his arms around his best friend, who returned the embrace in full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Thanks, big brother\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you were willing to look like my species just to meet up with me.  Only fair I repay the favor\u2026albeit indirectly, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two snickered a bit at that, before a DEEP rumbling emitted from the new blond fox\u2019s still mostly flat belly.  Immediately, rather than blush, Naruto grinned toothily and said, \u201c\u2026And since I dunno how to really MOVE with my new legs\u2026whadduya say we make that irrelevant by stuffing ourselves silly\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, now you\u2019re DEFINITELY speaking my language,\u201d Kurama said teasingly, before the two turned back to the table as Kurama sat himself back on his seat.  The young fox was about to dig in, when he stopped, ears twitching, as a thought occurred.  \"Say, Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond fox turned back to Kurama and asked, \"What's up, kiddo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, seeing as how...you were just mentioning smell being enhanced, and flavors probably tasting different.  Mind if I ask how you like my cooking...now that you're like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurama, you KNOW your cooking is amazing, I don't see-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-W-Well, I know it's pretty good, but...I so rarely get to cook for anyone who isn't human.  And, well, I'M hardly the most impartial judge, h-heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his eyes in a good natured way, Naruto nonetheless nudged Kurama in the arm playfully, before taking his first forkful of pancakes as a fox...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And almost immediately after...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as his muzzle closed and the pancakes touched his tongue, Naruto froze for a moment, his eyes bugging wide open. Concerned, Kurama tilted his head. \"N-Naruto? Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't respond. Instead, he took the fork out, slowly chewed the pancakes, and swallowed, absentmindedly smacking his chops. Slowly, his eyes drifted to the pancakes still on his plate. Kurama winced. \"I'm sorry, did your taste buds get messed up? I swear, I didn't mean to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny further comment on Kurama's part was forestalled as Naruto planted his paws on either side of the table, shoved his muzzle <i>into</i> the pancakes, and began tearing into them. Kurama yelped and jerked back a bit, staring as his friend took wide, toothy mouthfuls of the flapjacks and gulped them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all Naruto could do not to moan in pleasure; as it was, his tail wagged rapidly. <i>Oh man...I thought these were good before, but now...</i> Everything tasted more...<i>everything</i>. Sweeter, fluffier...<i>more</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that eating it face-first wasn't quick enough, Naruto wrapped his paws around his pancakes, leaned forward, and <i>shoved</i> the mass of flapjacks toward his muzzle, simultaneously chomping and pushing the fluffy, heavenly discs into his waiting maw. Heedless of the syrup that got on his fur and the bits that landed on his shirt, he gorged himself on the delicious treat, not stopping until his paws were holding nothing but air. Even so, he eagerly licked his paws, getting as much syrup and pancake bits off of them as possible. Kurama blinked slowly at this. \"So...you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Naruto grabbed a handful of bacon and crammed it into his muzzle, his tail wagging eagerly at the savory tastes that assailed his fox-i-fied taste buds. Not content with that pawful, he dragged another plate of bacon toward him and shoved pawful after pawful of the meat into his muzzle, his face lighting up as he did so. Soon, the plate was depleted, his muzzle bulging with half-eaten bacon. Eagerly looking around, he spied a large pitcher of milk, grabbed it, and began chugging it, washing the bacon down and assailing his mouth with the same creamy, refreshing taste that had preceded his transformation. He guzzled it eagerly, thin streams of milk trailing down the sides of his mouth. Kurama watched, open-mouthed, as the level of milk in the pitcher steadily dropped, until Naruto slammed it down, bone-dry. \"Uh.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had barely taken a breath before he grabbed a plate of sticky buns, lifted the whole thing to his muzzle, tilted his head back, and let them slide, one after the other, into his waiting muzzle, chewing and swallowing them as they came. When the plate was empty, he eagerly licked it, let it clatter to the table, and quickly got to work on a plate of French toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama watched, his muzzle dropping even further open as Naruto went to town on more and more plates of food, shoveling them into his mouth with little decorum <i>Wow...guess turning into a fox-person really DID improve his taste buds, huh...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, several plates later, Naruto settled back in his chair, patted his stomach, and let out a belch. \"Ooh man, that was the best thing I've ever tasted....\" he muttered happily, his tongue lolling out the side of his mouth. Indeed, his stomach had grown from a slight curve into a noticeably round shape, though it still remained beneath his shirt, and the fur around his muzzle was stained with syrup, crumbs, and other miniscule remains of his feeding frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of himself, Kurama managed to close his muzzle. \"H-heh, you're not done yet, are you?\" He asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sat up a bit straighter. \"What, are you kidding?\" He gestured to the table; in spite of all he had eaten, he'd barely put a dent in Kurama's breakfast. \"Nah, I'm just resting for a second.\" He grinned at Kurama. \"Seriously, though, buddy, as awesome as your stuff tastes normally? When I'm a fox person, it's like...it's like I'm eating ROCKET'S cooking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama jolted upright at that. \"R-really...?\" He almost whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surly little raccoon had been one of....no, THE single best cook Kurama had ever met. He'd met plenty of excellent cooks in Fiore, of course (the number of times he'd had to waddle home or have Gajeel pry him out of a booth were testament to that), but there was something about Rocket's cooking that made it, quite simply, incomparable. To hear someone, especially his best friend, give his food such high praise....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned wide, squinting his eyes shut. \"Damn straight! Hell, I think you turning me into a fox was the best thing that coulda happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes widened. \"Y-you do?\" He replied hesitantly, even as he felt a great deal of the residual guilt dissolving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto burped and licked his chops, still grinning. \"For food this tasty? Hell yeah! In fact...\" At this, his grin grew mischievous. \"...why the hell should we even bother with forks and knives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama's expression eased, and he grinned in return. \"You mean...eat like nature intended? Nothin' but our mouths 'n paws?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winked. \"Nothin' but our mouths and paws,\" he affirmed. \"In fact...\" he sat upright, rubbed his paws together, and let his eyes run over the goodies still on the table. \"I think I'm about all rested up.\" He grinned widely at his friend. \"Ready to go hog-wild?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama looked up at the ceiling folding his arms. \"Well, let me think about it for a second...\" he muttered in a mock-contemplating tone. Then, like like a whip, he was attacking a heaping plate of eggs with nothing but his muzzle and paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked. \"That's what I thought,\" he laughed, doing the same to a plate that had sausages literally piled on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made quick work of those first plates, before they each moved on to another, then another, and then another still, using nothing but their paws to eat. Each of them blitzed on, emboldened by the wonderful flavors assailing their taste buds and paying little heed to the bits that landed on the table or their clothing. As each plate or bowl was picked clean, it was set aside, and before long, they began piling up....and up...and up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, their stomachs quickly began showing the effects of their eager eating; Naruto's already rounded stomach slowly swelled bigger, both pushing his shirt out and distorting the flame spiral on the front. Kurama's trim stomach, on the other hand, swiftly turned concave, then rounded, which bulged bigger and bigger beneath his pajama shirt. Eventually, Naruto's stomach, having already been quite rounded from his previous feeding frenzy, began to push his shirt up, slowly revealing the white fur underneath. Taking note of this, Kurama ate even faster, consequently causing his own stomach to grow at a quicker rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on the two ate, and higher and higher the plate towers became, and the bigger and bigger their stomachs grew. Naruto's shirt continued its slow advance upwards, revealing more and more of his now-furry stomach, while Kurama's pajama shirt finally began pulling upwards. Every now and again, one of them would grab a pitcher of milk and take several huge gulps to wash their food down, then slam the pitchers down and keep right on eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two friends finally stopped for a break, having demolished roughly half of what was on the table...and as they leaned back in their chairs and exhaled, it definitely showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's stomach had swollen greatly, to the point where it was rather close to the table. His shirt had hiked up quite high, several inches above his somewhat-concealed navel and exposing much of his white-furred belly for all to see. His pants were feeling rather tight, but he wasn't paying that much mind at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's stomach wasn't quite as big, but it was definitely getting there, only being a few inches further away from the table than Naruto's, and his shirt resting directly above his belly button. \"Mmmmm....\" he muttered, happily rubbing his stomach with both paws. \"This is sooooo good....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto leaned back in his chair, doing the same. \"Ya really outdid yourself, Kurama...\" He opened his eyes and looked down at his stomach; rubbing a big, furry orb was an...odd sensation, but not at all unpleasant. Curiously, he planted both paws on his bare, furry belly and massaged it some more. Immediately, his expression turned dopey. <i>Scratch that...not not unpleasant....AMAZING....</i> Giggling groggily, he massaged his belly with both paws, causing his tail to wag and one of his feet to thump a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, giggling, was tempted to do the same, but as he looked down at his own stomach, a thought occurred to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmmm...we still have a lotta this stuff left to go, and our tummies are pretty big already, but its so much fun going fast....</i> Kurama looked up at the ceiling. <i>Hmmm....what to do...</i> Suddenly, his eyes widened. <i>That's it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a sudden shuffling of fabric, Naruto stopped rubbing and opened his eyes. \"Oi, Kurama, what's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spluttered as he saw the young fox <i>peeling his shirt off</i> and tossing it to the side. \"Kurama, what the hell...?!\" He gaped as Kurama <i>wriggled out of his pajama shorts</i>, kicking them off once the were at his feet. \"K-Kurama, you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...stripping?\" Kurama supplied helpfully, now in nothing but his boxers. \"Don't worry, I did it on purpose this time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...why...?\" Naruto mumbled, still trying to wrap his head around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled. \"Well, we had so much fun eating super-fast, but our clothes are gonna start getting in the way, so...\" he gestured to his discarded pajamas. \"Don't worry, we'd still be wearing our skivvies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto spluttered again. \"W-wait...WE?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama nodded, giggling again...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s no biggie!  Remember when we first met?  I didn\u2019t even wear clothes at the time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Kiiiinda different, kiddo\u2026\u201d Naruto muttered uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you hafta worry about anyone seein\u2019 us.  We\u2019re pals and we\u2019re both covered in fur.  Technically speaking, that acts like a big onesy,\u201d Kurama insisted before grinning impishly and adding, \u201c\u2019Sides, I dunno about\u2019chu, but eatin\u2019 in the skivvies is kinda liberating.  Feels all nice\u2019n breezy.  And our tummies can grow as big as want \u2018em to without having to worry about constraint of any kind!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down at his already rounded belly, Naruto drummed his clawed fingers atop his taut middle in contemplation.  Then, a moment later, sighed to himself, and the said, \u201c\u2026Ah, what the hell.  Ain\u2019t like Dog breath\u2019s here to talk smack anyway, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo saying, Naruto gulped to himself, then wrapped his fingers around the bottom of his shirt and pulled it off, tossing it aside like how Kurama had done.  A moment later, he was working around his bloated belly to pull his pants down, but eventually managed.  After a few moments, Naruto took a breath and examined himself in the near buff.  He wasn\u2019t used to seeing blond fur over his normally tan skin.  Nor was Naruto particularly use to the prospect of sitting around in the open without any clothes on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill grinning, Kurama leaned in a bit and asked, \u201cSo?  How do ya feel, Naruto?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s expression seemed to signify uncertainty.  But the instant a soft breeze wafted into the Hotel from an open window, Naruto\u2019s expression changed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, wow\u2026\u201d Naruto muttered in mild awe.  \u201cH-heh, that, that actually does feel nice.  Kinda loosey goosy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickering, Kurama just nodded as Naruto held his arms out to his sides and stretched his back, causing his rounded belly to stick out a bit more as he seemed to be feeling things out as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, it\u2019s kinda different when your body is covered in fur.  Different from what I\u2019m used to,\u201d said Naruto, dropping his arms down and sitting back up normally in his seat.  \u201c\u2026Different, but not unpleasant\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToldja,\u201d Kurama said innocently, before grinning more toothily and adding, \u201cso, now that\u2019cha see it\u2019s not ALL bad\u2026whadduya say we plow through this heap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his chops, Naruto turned his attention back down to his breakfast, and the remaining pile set before him and his young fox companion.  And without another word, Naruto grabbed a plate of bacon and started greedily scarfing it down, crunching and munching heartily with each crispy strip of bacon consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama couldn\u2019t help but snicker at the sight for a moment.  But nonetheless, the young Tailed Beast soon turned his attention to a stack of waffles, then, after lathering the entire stack with syrup, began digging in heartily.  Rather than go one at a time, Kurama was practically cutting into several waffles at once, and scarfing a fork impaling at least three or four waffles at once into his eager and gaping maw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm-MM!  I gotta remember this waffle recipe for next time the Guild has a breakfast buffet going on!\u201d Kurama remarked gleefully to himself after gulping down his hearty mouthful.  A mere moment later, he was chomping into even more waffles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, even as he was occupied with his own meal, Kurama couldn\u2019t help but smile at the sight of Naruto\u2019s single tail, as it wagged happily with each passing moment of his prolonged breakfast feasting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Heh, wonder if it\u2019s my cooking that\u2019s got him so stoked, or how much better everything tastes with enhanced senses</i>, Kurama thought idly to himself as he chewed on a hefty mouthful of waffles, before tilting his head back and gulping heartily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Naruto, ever oblivious to Kurama\u2019s musing, just continued gobbling bacon like there was no tomorrow.  He was quite literally stuffing one handful of strips into his gaping maw after the other, using his newly formed canines to tear through his bacon like nothing, and gulp it down just as quickly.  And yet, due to his new form, no bite went unsavored.  No detail went unnoticed.   Naruto\u2019s senses were picking up on every little nuance to Kurama\u2019s cooking, and the teenaged Fox loved every second of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, hehe, damn, kiddo, I don\u2019t think I can friggin\u2019 stop inhaling this stuff!\u201d  Naruto exclaimed almost gleefully, before continuing to stuff his craw with more and more bacon, occasionally grabbing half of a toasted English Muffin and cramming that into his maw on top of everything else.  After taking a big gulp, Naruto wiped his maw with his forearm and snickered before adding, \u201cHehe, and you weren\u2019t kidding.  This actually\u2026kinda feels\u2026nice!  Like, liberating.  I\u2019m stuffin\u2019 my belly with as much as I can fit into my mouth at any given moment, and I\u2019ve got no shirt feeling tighter around my belly or my chest.  And no pants to have to worry about busting either!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama snickered with amusement before impishly adding, \u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing stopping you from eating like this whenever you want, Naruto.  Just \u2018cause ya won\u2019t have fur afterwards doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t just go loosey goosy.  Just saying\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in a more deadpanned manner, Naruto glanced back and said, \u201c\u2026That\u2019s\u2026actually exactly what that means, kiddo\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama just laughed with amusement as Naruto rolled his eyes yet again, but nonetheless, continued cramming the remaining bacon into his eager maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, within no time at all, Naruto had completely devoured his stack of bacon within no time at all, which had caused his already rounded stomach to press outward just a little bit more.  Licking each of his clawed digits clean, Naruto smacked his chops and turned his attention to another pitcher of Milk.  Grinning, Naruto grabbed the pitcher with one hand, brought it to his muzzle, dipped his head back far, and wasted no time guzzling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping for a moment, Kurama couldn\u2019t help but snicker with amusement as he watched Naruto\u2019s blond furred throat bob in and out vigorously with each hearty gulp of milk chugged down.  More amusingly enough, Naruto was chugging so hard that Kurama could actually HEAR every single gulp rippling down Naruto\u2019s throat.  As Naruto continued chugging away, his free hand rested idly against his bloated stomach.  Kurama could see it steadily expanding bit by bit with each hearty gulp of milk surging down Naruto\u2019s gullet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, a lil thirsty there, big bro?\u201d  Kurama said teasingly.  But Naruto held out a finger and kept on chugging without any respite.  All the while, Naruto\u2019s bloated stomach only expanded outwards even more, audibly sloshing with milk as it just now started to rest a little bit on Naruto\u2019s lap ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after just under two minutes time, Naruto slammed his now completely empty pitcher onto the table, and almost immediately after, let out a positively TITANIC burp, which blasted with enough force to make Kurama wince.  When it rumbled to an end, Naruto moaned with relief and slouched back against his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew!\u201d Naruto muttered, patting his rounded, sloshing belly, both from relief and immense satisfaction, \u201c\u2026URP!  Man, did you HEAR that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinging out his own long, rabbit-like ears, Kurama snickered and said, \u201cNaruto, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019d hafta be DEAF not to hear that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, guess bein\u2019 a fox gives me stronger pipes then too, huh.  That why you always sounded like a foghorn whenever we used to eat out together\u2026and last night?\u201d  Naruto inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama just laughed some more and scratched his fuzzy cheek before shrugging his shoulders and adding, \u201cEh, maybe.  That COULD explain why I always school you though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow THAT got Naruto\u2019s attention\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh HO, is THAT a fact\u2026\u201d Naruto muttered, folding his arms with a brow cocked\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama once again shrugs as he smiles innocently and replies with, \u201cWhaaat?  I\u2019m not bragging.  I just have inherently better pipes than you do, Naruto.  I AM a Tailed Beast after all.  I was kinda\u2026well, MADE to have pipes that impress.  H-heh, mind you, it\u2019s usually for blasting Tailed Beast Beams, but there\u2019s no rule sayin\u2019 I can\u2019t use \u2018em for other, slightly less destructive purposes, right?  Y\u2019know, like the purpose of schooling my best friend\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThem\u2019s fighting words, kiddo\u2026\u201d Naruto said, in a mock warning tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama just grinned impishly back at Naruto and replied with, \u201cHuh, I guess they are\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those last teasing, but totally challenging words, Naruto realized that there was just one thing and one thing only, that could be done about this situation, and that was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto loved Ichiraku's ramen; Kiba had known that for as long as he'd known the Uzumaki, even before he'd come to respect and (begrudgingly) like him. He ate it practically every day, for all three meals: breakfast (well, except when he just ate some instant ramen at home), lunch, and dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, he loved it: at each meal, he'd get a few bowls, at least, not stopping until he was sated. In some cases, two bowls became four, four became eight, eight became ten, ten became dozens...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the last case, Naruto would become visibly affected by the massive amount of noodles he'd ingested, and his gut would take on a noticeably distended appearance. It would vary, of course; sometimes, passing him on the street, Kiba would see Naruto happily rubbing his stomach, the appendage rounded and stretching his jacket a bit. Other times, he'd see him lurching through the streets, his stuffed belly sticking out a couple of inches in front of him, shaking a bit with every step he took. In these instances, Kiba could even have sworn that a few of the teeth of his jacket had come apart, exposing the black-shirted stomach underneath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few, more extreme instances, though, Kiba could tell that Naruto gorged himself--I mean, REALLY gorged himself--and it was even more apparent than when he just had a very good meal. At times like this, Kiba would see Naruto actually &lt;i&gt;waddling&lt;/i&gt; about. His stomach would be extremely rounded and distended, his black-and-orange jacket seemingly pried open to reveal the black shirt underneath. The shirt, in turn, would have ridden up considerably, unable to fully contain the jam-packed mass that was the other boy's abodmen. It would be hiked up a few inches above his belly button, showing his bare belly for the whole world to see. And, in one instance, his button had been undone and his fly had been completely open, unable to handle the strain the spherical mass had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes, Naruto would seem a bit sick from all this; he might be a bit green, for instance, or he might simply look extremely dazed. More often that not, though, he'd look incredibly happy with himself: rubbing his belly, shaking it as he walked/lurched/waddled about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, Kiba tried to deny it for a while; forcing himself not to stare, stopping his hands as they went to his own stomach-but eventually, he admitted to himself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, I wanna see what that's like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, to that end, he'd gone around town with a full wallet, purchasing any food he could think of to bring back to his place; meat, sweets, everything in-between...he only skimped on soft foods, because, well, they were too...mushy, for his liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now he sat, alone at home (his mother and sister were out on different missions, but it was his day off), staring at a table laden with all sorts of food imaginable, Akamaru looking at him with a mix of worry and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause he was sure his clothes were going to take a bit of a beating, he'd dressed appropriately for the occasion: he was wearing a pair of grayish pants, and a teen-sized version of a shirt he'd loved to wear back in his academy days (he'd gotten it from a specialty store): it was a dark green, v-necked shirt, with lining around the neck area and a picture of a goofy cartoon dog face on the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep whiff, it was all he could do to keep himself from salivating as the scents of various delicacies assaulted his nostrils: candy, dango, all kinds of meat, a veritable scattering of fruit...with any luck, it'd all be in his gut before the day was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden whimpering caught his attention, and he immediately whipped his head toward his canine companion. The massive white dog was staring at him, whining and tilting his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just laughed good-naturedly, reaching out to pat Akamaru on the head. \"Ah, c'mon, Akamaru; Naruto does this all the time. How bad can it be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog rolled his eyes, laid down, and rested his head on his paws; he wouldn't be able to dissuade Kiba now, but he supposed he could watch in the meantime, make sure the dog-nin didn't hurt himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving Akamaru one last affectionate ruffle, Kiba turned back to the massive spread, grinning. Reaching out, he grabbed an apple in one hand and a roll in the other, brought them both to his mouth, and bit off massive pieces of both of them. Chewing loudly, he gulped, then resumed the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luckily, he had thought ahead before he began his binge, as he had cleaned off the table, then unwrapped everything he had purchased, leaving it in a pile that took up most of the table. With everything uneatable removed, Kiba was free to eat without thinking, which is precisely what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more apples, (they were Kiba's favorite fruit), a few more rolls, and a lot of jerky disappeared in Kiba's belly, it became noticeably distended, and even with his shirt on, a fairly small mound could be found where his abdomen used to be. Akamaru was amazed that he got this far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru continued to stare in amazement as Kiba ate even more jerky, taking care of a stash he had made of the meat strips. He then began working on a pocket of assorted gummy candies. He loved those because they were so chewy. Either way, he dug in, oblivious to his expanding stomach, which had begun stretching his shirt, becoming quite noticeable through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Akamaru noticed Kiba switch back to his favorite food group, protein, as he dug into more jerky and a few smoked sausages. He continued to tear through them, his shirt beginning to rise, as his stomach was too much for it to contain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru continued to watch, amazed, as bite after bite continued to enter his ravenous gullet, accumulating in the ever-expanding orb of flesh that continued to lift up Kiba's shirt with its growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Kiba had made quite a large dent in his massive pile of food, and his shirt had ridden up to the point where it barely managed to contain his navel. At that point he laid back, somewhat satiated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru was amazed that Kiba had managed to complete this feat, and he relaxed now, knowing that his buddy appeared to be finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba took this time to examine himself, his eyes widened as he looked at his stomach, which was poking out enough to become clearly visible. Kiba then rubbed his overfilled belly, smiling with a satisfied look on his face. \"This is awesome! Now I see why Naruto does it all the time.\" Kiba blurted out. Akamaru then barked, \"Aren't you worried about your health?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba merely responded, \"You don't have to worry so much. Naruto does this all the time and he's fine. Besides, I can just work it off when I train with you!\" Akamaru was relieved by that thought, and laid back down next to Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba then looked at the pile of food, which was still quite sizable, and he gained new motivation, hoping just to prove to himself that he can complete this impressive feat. He proudly gave his protruding abdomen a confident pat before digging back into the new pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! He isn't finished yet!\" Akamaru thought, and he was about to try stopping Kiba, however he knew he wouldn't be able to. He also enjoyed seeing Kiba this happy with himself. He didn't want to admit it, but he was also curious to see just how far Kiba would be able to go.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Faster than Akamaru could blink, Kiba was back in the fray, grabbing bunches of beef jerky in his hands and ripping off entire chunks off at a time, only chewing them a bit before gulping them down and repeating the process until everything he'd grabbed in his hands was gone. All the while, his stomach had slowly swelled, forcing his shirt further up until the bottom half of his navel could be seen poking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after stopping to breathe, Kiba grabbed an extra large packet of gummy candies and ripped it open with his teeth, reaching his hand in and shoving entire handfuls of the candies into his mouth. This time, he spent some more time chewing them, as he enjoyed both the sweet taste and their chewiness. After the bag was empty, he tossed it aside and grabbed a mound of smoked sausages in his hands, bringing it up to his face and taking huge bites out of it, heedless of the grease that got on his face and on his shirt. Speaking of the article of clothing, it had, by now, ridden up further, exposing his belly button in its entirety. As he tore his way through the rest of the sausages, his shirt slowly rode up further and further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru watched all this with a mix of horror and fascination. <i>Oh man, he's really getting into it, isn't he?</i> Akamaru mused to himself, watching with some amusement as Kiba, grabbing a large bottle of soda, started downing it, causing his stomach to swell further outwards and force his shirt up even higher and well above his navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after plunking down the empty bottle, Kiba seemed to slow down considerably. Indeed, even as he continued ripping jerky apart, he did so far less enthusiastically, spending a longer time chewing before swallowing. He seemed to notice this, and took much larger bites; as a result, his belly bulged a tiny bit with every swallow. Once he'd finished the jerky, he grabbed a handful of rolls, shoving as many as he could in his mouth, chewing them and swallowing them. His belly bulged out further, and was now beginning to touch the table. Then he did the same with more of the gummy candy, the sausages, more jerky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, groaning, he turned to grab a couple of apples...and stopped. \"I-I can't,\" he moaned, leaning back in his chair. \"I'm stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the state his partner was in, Akamaru could easily believe that. Kiba's belly was ridiculously swollen, sticking out well in front of him and starting to push against the table. His shirt rode well above his belly button, resting comfortably near the top of his stomach. His waistline also looked extremely tight, as his pants struggled to hold back the engorged mass. <i>Um, Kiba, your pants...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Feeling around his waistline, Kiba blushed. \"O-oh...thanks, Akamaru.\" Reaching under his belly, he fiddled with his pants button for a few seconds, finally getting a good grip on it and pulling it out, undoing his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach, at this point desperately seeking more room, surged forward, bumping into the table causing it, and the food items still left on it, to shake. Simultaneously, his fly opened partway, but was quickly seized and pulled down the rest of the way by Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog-nin sighed blissfully, a goofy grin spreading across his face. \"Oh man, that feels so much better...\" He leaned back in his chair a bit, showing the front of his undone pants and giving Akamaru a clear look at his paw-print patterned boxers. Sighing again, Kiba massaged his belly with both hands. \"Oh man, I could get used to this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a knocking sounded at the door. Snapped out of his happy daze, Kiba snapped to attention. <br>\r\nC-coming!\" he called. He pushed back in his chair and away from the table and slowly got to his feet, his massive belly causing him to sway a little bit. However, he was able to plant a hand on the table and stabilize himself as he stood upright. Sighing in relief, he lifted his hand off and, slowly turning towards the door, began lurching and waddling his way towards the door, his belly shaking and wobbling with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like a tortuously long time, he finally reached the door. Grabbing the handle, he opened it to see... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Naruto was surprised to see a large belly attached to Kiba, which wobbled as he stopped to introduce Naruto. Akamaru, of course was standing at his side, wagging his tail, eager to see a visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Naruto got past his confusion, and his usual, cheery expression returned. He said, \"Looks like someone ate well!\" before prodding Kiba's belly playfully, giggling all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one to talk! I see you get like this all the time!\" Kiba retorted defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does feel good, though!\" Naruto added simply. \"You said it!\" Kiba replied, patting his belly proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here anyway?\" Kiba inquired. Naruto answered, saying, \"I'm bored. I haven't had any missions lately, and I was looking for something fun to do. You're always running around the forest by Konoha with Akamaru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well it feels good to relax once in a while.\" Kiba then retreated back into his house, gesturing for Naruto to come in. Naruto removed his sandals, leaving them by the door, then followed Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Naruto saw the table with a small pile of food on it, in addition to a few scraps scattered across the table. \"Feel free to dig in! I've already had my fill\" Kiba said, in response to a growl from Naruto's stomach, as he patted his bloated belly, showing it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't need to hear it twice. He just said, \"Thanks Kiba!\" before working on finishing the pile. \"Oh no, now Naruto is here. He's bound to encourage Kiba.\" Akamaru thought as he laid down by the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, Naruto had finished the little food that Kiba had, leaving him with a small bulge that made the slightest impression on his jacket. \"That was some good food!\" Naruto said, but then he added, \"The tank's still pretty empty, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's fill it! You might even be able to eat as much as me!\" Kiba responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be easy!\" Naruto replied cockily starting an argument between the two teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like their at it again.\" Akamaru thought as he listened to the banter between the two. He got a little nervous when he heard the two mention measuring tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Kiba wanted to see if Naruto could beat him, so he said, \"So are you going to get something to eat, or are you going to keep talking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then replied, \"Just give me food, and it will be gone!\"</span></div></div>",

They'd eagerly awaited it, envisioning taking 'walks' (actually energetic runs through the trees), training, and maybe hanging out with/bugging Naruto. Sadly, a freak storm had hit Konoha, rendering all those plans moot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, clad in a gray short-sleeved shirt and black shorts-attire specifically set aside for days off like this-had been rather unhappy about this. There was no way they could walk in this weather, and he didn't feel like making the trek to Naruto's apartment  in the downpour. What was worse, his mother and sister were both off on missions, meaning the only person he could share his misery with was Akamaru. That wasn't too big a problem, though-after all, the dog had been his best buddy since the Academy, and he'd been just as disappointed-but it still sucked, no two ways about it. As a result, the two of them had stewed in their disappointment for a good part of the morning, chatting and complaining about the circumstances. When lunchtime had rolled around, though, the grumbling of their stomachs had given them an idea. They both loved meat, and they had an excess supply of steaks, so why not put them to good use?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Kiba who had initially posited the idea of a competition. Akamaru, though reluctant at first-after all, he always tried to stop Naruto and Kiba during their competitions-had eventually agreed; after all, it wasn't like they had anything else to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, they were now staring down two veritable mountains of steaks, Akamaru licking his chops and Kiba picking up a fork and knife as they eyed them hungrily. The dog-nin looked at his partner, grinning. \"Ready whenever you are, buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru nodded, wagging his tail. <i>Get ready....on your mark....</i> he tensed his legs, <i>get set...</i> his stomach growled, as though to punctuate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GO!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, boy and dog fell upon their steaks with reckless abandon, Kiba cutting off huge pieces of steak and shoving them in his mouth, with Akamaru taking a steak into his mouth and gnashing it up as best he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was to the point that the furry appendage was now a great deal rounded, and began to appear as a very distinct orb that only continued to grow, even at this slower pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, noticing that his buddy was flagging, put on a burst of speed. At this juncture, he had eaten enough steaks that his stomach has pushed out even further, and his shirt had finally begun to give up, rising up and exposing a tiny strip of flesh. Disregarding this, Kiba ripped off chunks of the steak he was holding in his hands as fast as he could, rapidly chewing and swallowing until the whole thing was gone. Practically tossing the bone aside, he grabbed another steak and powered through it the same way. Soon, he had established about a two-to-three steak lead over Akamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba ate his steaks, his stomach bulged, growing a bit with each steak. Consequently, his shirt rose a little higher, slowly exposing more and more flesh. And, as steak after steak entered his gullet, rounder and bigger his stomach bulged, and the more of his flesh slowly began to see the light of day as his shirt gradually hiked up more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevouring his twelfth steak, he tossed the bone aside, belched, and leaned back, patting his belly contentedly. \"Ah man, these steaks are really awesome...\" he thought happily, looking down at his stomach as he did so.

The appendage was pushing out even more, and had started to contact the table; what was more, his waistline was feeling incredibly tight, dangerously beginning to strain the button on his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes still on his friend, his hands went down to his waistline. \"Heh, if ya keep this up, you could go head to head with me and Naruto!\" Hands finding his pants button, he undid it, sighing in relief as the pressure abated and his gut flopping out a bit, pushing harder against the table. In the meantime, his fly went down a few teeth, though the majority of it remained zipped up. \"Oh man, that felt so good...\" Rubbing his stomach, he licked his lips happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru burped. <i>Gotta admit, that was...that was pretty damn fun.</i> He let his tongue loll out the side of his mouth. <i>I can see why you and Naruto like doing it so much.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scooted his chair closer to Akamaru, scratching his distended belly fondly. \"Heh, yeah, it's pretty cool, isn't it?\" Akamaru yipped happily in reply, tail wagging lazily. Kiba smiled happily at his friend's contentment, but a sudden crack of thunder promptly soured that expression. Looking towardsa window, he scowled as he saw the rain still pouring down. \"Ah, damn it, it's still raining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's eyes opened and flitted towards Kiba's midsection. <i>Probably for the better, considering what we look like right now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shrugged. \"Eh, I guess. Still, I hate being shut up inside...\" Sighing, he planted a hand on the table. Grunting, he hoisted himself up, exposed belly wobbling as he did so. Turning himself around, he lurched his way towards the fridge, bouncing and wobbling as he did so. Reaching the fridge, he opened the freezer portion of it, arms reaching in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru kept his eyes on him, tilting his head curiously. <i>Um...Kiba? What're you doing?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering, Kiba pulled out of the freezer, bearing several containers of ice cream of varying flavorsin his arm. Shutting the freezer door with his back, he lurched back towards the table, plopping them all on the table, sitting back in his seat and prying the top off a container of strawberry ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's eyes bugged out. <i>Oh, you can't be serious...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, grabbing a nearby spoon, dug it into the container. Leaving the spoon in, he turned and smirked at Akamaru. \"Hey, there's nothin' else to do, and I'm kinda in the mood for something sweet.\" Turning back to the container, he scooped a large spoonful of ice cream out and spooned it into his mouth, swallowing it. \"Mmm, that's good...\" Taking a couple more containers (none of them chocolate), he pried the tops off them and took them in his arms, bringing them as gently as he could to the floor and setting them in front of Akamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog looked up at his partner, whining. <i>Kiba, what are you...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba only ruffled the dog's head. \"There ya go, buddy; lemme know if ya want any more.\" That taken care of, he returned to his strawberry ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru looked from Kiba, then to his ice cream, then back to Kiba, then back to his ice cream. He was stuffed, but the ice cream looked so good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog whined. <i>Oh, what the hell; it's not like we have anything else to do.</i> Nosing his way around the containers, he found a container of vanilla and began biting/slurping it up. Against his better judgement, he found himself getting into the flavors, and he went at it with gusto, even as Kiba maintained full steam on his.</span></div></div>",

The appendage was now resting squarely in his lap, his shirt riding completely above it. It was well near beach-ball size, putting pressure even against his completely-opened fly and inseams, and had even started to force his legs apart a bit. \"Oh man, that was good..\" He burped again, causing his belly to wobble a bit. Kiba giggled slightly at the sensation, his face flushing as he did so. \"Ah, damn it,\" he cursed, massaging his gut with one of his hands, \"I've been spending way too much time around Naruto...\"  Still, he thought as he rubbed his stomach, that <i>had</i> felt good... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at Akamaru, lying on his side and his swollen, past-pregnant-looking belly sticking out from under him, panting even as he looked up at this partner. \"Akamaru,\" he began, blushing a bit, \"I'm gonna do something kinda stupid, so just keep it between us, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You mean more stupid than stuffing ourselves so much we look like we're carrying puppies?</i> Akamaru almost retorted, but stopped; after all, he HAD had fun... <i>Don't worry, Kiba; my muzzle's sealed.</i> Kiba grinned, returning his attention to his belly. <i>I have to ask, though; what is it you're...</i> He was brought up short as Kiba placed both hands squarely on either side of his stomach and began shaking it, the appendage bouncing up and down. Kiba had a goofy smile on his face, giggles escaping his mouth. <i>...oh.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kiba got tired of that, he smacked his gut hard with both hands, his distended midsection jiggling and shimmying from the impact. As it started to settle down, he leaned back and smacked it hard a few times in the middle, causing it to contort and bounce around more. Giggling harder, he reached underneath, lifted his stomach up (and exposing some of his tan undergarments in the process), and dropped it back down, bouncing and jiggling even as it smacked against the chair. \"Hee hee...I can see why Naruto likes this part so much.\" To Akamaru's shock, he dipped a finger into his exposed belly button, wiggling it around and giggling even harder. \"This feels kinda cool!\" He let loose with another unexpected burp, and he giggled even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru watched him with more than a little bit of incredulity...but he couldn't help but wag his tail. As ridiculous as he looked at the moment, there was no denying Kiba was having a great time just fooling around with his distended belly. And if Kiba was that happy, well...Akamaru had no real reason to complain. Besides, it wasn't like they could really do much else at the moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Akamaru yawned, closed his eyes, and nodded off. Kiba, likewise, tired of playing with his gut, and slid off the chair and directly onto the floor. Pulling himself up to Akamaru, he laid his head on the dog's bloated midsection, closed his eyes, and draped an arm across his own exposed belly, the other one splayed out to the side. In short order, he, too, had fallen asleep, mouth opening and a tiny bit of drool collecting at the corner of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Kiba yawned widely and blinked his eyes open, opening them fully when he saw calm night peeking in from outside; apparently, the storm had stopped. Kiba beamed, planting his hands on the floor and sitting upright. \"Oi, Akamaru! Wake up, buddy!\" He turned to the dog, still sleeping; though his stomach was still considerably distended, it had digested a great deal while they had slept, and he would likely have no trouble moving about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's stomach was in much the same state; though it was still quite rounded and pushed out quite a bit, it was not quite as big as it had been several hours previously; in fact, Kiba found that if he pulled his shirt down, it would cover his stomach, albeit barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, Akamaru opened his muzzle, smacked his lips, and rolled onto his front. <i>Buh...wha?</i> he whined blearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Kiba ruffled the top of his head. \"Take a look, buddy! It's stopped raining!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru's eyes opened wide. <i>It has?!</i> Tail wagging, he looked towards the window; sure enough, it was a calm, temperate night out. <i>Well, whaddaya know?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kiba stumbled back to his feet, gripping onto the opened ends of his shorts as he did so. \"About damn time, too; piggin' out was fun, but I was starting to go stir-crazy!\" Sucking in his still prominent gut as much as he could, he forced both ends of his shorts together, buttoning them back up with some difficulty. Still holding the breath in, Kiba zipped his shorts up, then, slowly, let his breath out. His stomach pressed considerably and a tad bit uncomfortably against his waistline, and his shorts felt quite tight, but Kiba shrugged it off; he'd felt worse pain before. Giving a satisfied nod, Kiba turned to Akamaru, who was struggling to his own feet. Walking over, he helped the dog up the rest of the way. \"There ya go, Akamaru.\" Smiling as the dog gave an appreciative bark, he scratched him behind his ears. \"So whaddaya say, Akamaru?\" he spoke up at last. \"You up for a late-night walk, maybe start to work these guts off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru perked up. <i>Like you really have to ask?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Kiba sauntered over to the front door, opened it, and waited until Akamaru had passed through it. Then, closing the door behind him, he took off after his friend through the darkened, still-damp streets of Konoha.</span></div></div>",

This continued as they walked, passerby slowing down to look at them, thankfully not stopping completely but simply going on their way. Kiba, feeling a little embarrassed, nonetheless smirked and patted his stomach; even Akamaru couldn't help but feel a little proud...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, Kiba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes widening, Kiba turned around towards the direction of the familiar voice. \"Eh? Naruto?\" Indeed, the Inuzuka and his partner saw a hint of orange in the distance, which became clearer as it ran down the street to greet them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Naruto came to a stop in front of them, grinning. \"Hey guys! What's up?\" He waved to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba raised his eyebrows; apparently, it had been Naruto's day off too, if his attire- camo-colored pants and sleeveless orange tank top with Konoha's symbol on the front- were any indication. \"Uh, hey, Naruto; what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto folded his arms behind his head. \"Eh, nothin' much; just spent the day training, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Akamaru's eyes widened. \"Training?!\" Kiba exclaimed, his disbelief evident. \"It was <i>pouring</i> out earlier! How the hell did you not get wet?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing a bit nervously, Naruto lowered one of his arms, using the other to rub the back of his head. \"Nah, I got wet; that's actually why I'm wearing these right now.\" He gestured to his garb. \"Stopped home, dried off, changed...\" His stomach growled. \"...and I was actually on my way to Ichiraku's to grab a bite!\" His eyes fell on Kiba's bulging midsection, pushing visibly against his shirt, and he giggled, poking it. \"Looks like you and Akamaru already took care of that, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing madly, Kiba swatted Naruto's arm away. \"H-hey! It's not like there was much else to do anyway, and besides, we're not crazy enough to train out in the pouring rain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru whined. <i>Yeah; my fur gets all damp and smelly.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill giggling, Naruto fished around his pocket. \"I'm not crazy, I'm just an awesome ninja; the weather doesn't bother me.\" Oblivious to Kiba's rolling his eyes, Naruto's hand stopped rummaging and came out with two coupons. \"Anyway, ya wanna come with? I got a couple of all-you-can-eat coupons for Ichiraku, but it's only good if there are two people together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scowled. \"You're conscripting me just so you can stuff your face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing nervously, Naruto replied. \"Um...maybe?\" He gave Kiba his best puppy-dog eyes. \"C'mon, Kiba, pleeeeeeease?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba continued to scowl, but was taken aback by a growl from his stomach. Slightly stuffed or no, it <i>had</i> been a while since that contest with Akamaru...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine!\" Kiba huffed, snatching one of the coupons from Naruto. \"But you owe me big time for this, Uzumaki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed. \"Ah, c'mon, Kiba, it'll be fun!\" With that, he turned and began running towards where he knew Ichiraku's to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching him go, Kiba sighed, turning towards Akamaru. \"Sorry, boy,\" he muttered, ruffling Akamaru's head. \"We'll go for a walk tomorrow, I promise!\" With that, he took off after Naruto. Akamaru, whining and knowing where this would go, followed after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, the two had reached Ichiraku's. Plopping down in his seat. Naruto showed Teuchi and Ayame his coupon, with Kiba following suit. Smiling and shaking his head, Teuchi brought out a large bowl of ramen for each of them, Naruto's being miso and Kiba's being barbecue. Thanking the man, Naruto dove into his bowl, clearly savoring it. Kiba tackled his at a similar pace, surprised at how hungry he was. Knowing the two, Teuchi and Ayame began preparing more bowls for them, as Akamaru sank to the ground, whining and covering his eyes with his ears. <i>Agh; it never ends...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two had finished with their first bowls, and had only begun to drink the broth when Teuchi and Ayame slid two more towards them. Slamming their now-empty bowls down, Kiba and Naruto attacked their second bowls with just as much gusto.</span></div></div>",

Akamaru was in shock, as the two weren't making this feast into some sort of competition. Instead, as they slurped their noodles down, they engaged in idle conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an amazing spectacle. The two would take massive bites of their ramen, and while chewing, they would say garbled words to each other, and they understood each other. They talked about past missions, training mishaps, and even mild gossip escaped their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was happening, their bellies began to push out. Kiba's which was already slightly distended, lifted up his shirt once more, revealing itself to the world. At this point, Naruto's belly was still barely noticeable under his tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the fifth bowl, Kiba's shirt was just about back up to his navel, while Naruto's was making a noticeable imprint on his tank top, threatening to lift it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the tenth bowl, Kiba's shirt no longer covering any of his belly, and his belly stuck out completely. Kiba had already removed his pants button a while back in anticipation, so his belly freely took up as much space as it needed, beginning to force open Kiba's zipper. Naruto's pants button was open for the same reason, but he wouldn't need the relief quite yet, because at this point, his tank top was still barely over his belly button. He had also pulled one bowl ahead of Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Kiba slowed down, only eating three more bowls before deciding to stop, topping off at thirteen bowls, his belly having forced open his zipped the rest of the way, resting comfortably on his lap without putting very much strain on his clothes. As Naruto continued his binge, Kiba played with his belly, and the two giggled at how it wobbled and swayed as Kiba batted it around childishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Naruto had finished six more bowls, and didn't look like he was going to slow down soon. His stomach had since lifted up his tank top the rest of the way, filling up every inch of space in front of him. The bloated appendage had pushed his zipper down nearly all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued his binge as Kiba began to talk to Akamaru, showing him his belly. Now without distraction, Naruto sped up a bit, plowing through a whopping seven more bowls before he finally decided to stop. He went a bit overboard, and his stomach showed, sticking out quite a bit in front of him, and considerably wider than the rest of his body, Naruto's belly was dressed with the wrinkled up bottom of his tank top. It stretched a few seams in his cargo pants, especially his inseam, quite considerably, threatening to tear them at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, Kiba had watched as Naruto finished his last two bowls, and when Naruto finished, he began to play with his belly like Kiba had earlier. When Naruto played with his belly, however, it had much less give, as his stomach was just about stretched to its limits. Either way, now that they were done, Naruto thanked Kiba for eating with him, then said...</span></div></div>",

I don't really have anything big planned.\" He massaged his belly, letting out a burp as he did so. \"I mean, all I was gonna do was take a walk with Akamaru to try to work off what was left from our pig-out earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. \"That actually sounds like a pretty good idea.\" Placing his hands on the counter, he pushed off, his stomach coming free with an audible \"plop.\" Using the counter as leverage, he stood up and turned around, distended belly wobbling. Letting out a satisfied belch, Naruto leaned against the counter, elbows resting on top of it. He could have sworn he felt his inseam rip a little bit, but he ignored it. \"I could use a walk, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Kiba scooted out with a bit less difficulty and made his way to his feet. Akamaru, ever diligent, stood up, allowing Kiba to lean on him and caught him as he stumbled from his new center of gravity. \"Still, that thing's even bigger than my gut; you think you can manage it?\" He massaged his belly with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, this thing?\" Naruto smacked his stomach a few times, releasing a titanic belch as a result. At about the same time, the tiny rip in his inseam grew a little more. \"It'll be no problem.\" Turning his head, he waved at Teuchi and Ayame. \"Thanks for the food!\" The two nodded and thanked him in turn, still marveling at how big Naruto and Kiba's stomachs had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a \"hup!\", Naruto pushed himself up off the counter, massive belly wobbling. He stumbled forward a bit, pinwheeling his arms, but he managed to bend his knees just enough to steady him. He frowned as he heard a ripping noise-yep, that was definitely his inseam ripping-but he wasn't about to give Kiba the satisfaction. Slowly, he stood back up, his stomach sticking out in front of him. Giggling, he reached his arms out and held his belly from its underside. He glanced to his friend. \"Ready to get going, Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog-nin rolled his eyes. \"Pfft; I was ready five minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scowled and gave him an annoyed, yet somehow friendly punch in the shoulder. \"Ah, shut it, dog breath.\" He took a lurching step forward, his belly wobbling even as he held it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked toothily, taking uncertain steps as he leaned on Akamaru. \"Only if you do it first, Uzumaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two were waddling through the streets, bellies bouncing and wobbling all the while. Naruto giggled at the sensations, and even Kiba couldn't resist a goofy grin. Naruto's inseams were currently holding, but it would only be a matter of time before they ripped again. This didn't particularly bother him, of course; after all, they were walking through the village looking beyond pregnant with their bare bellies sticking out from under their shirts, and they'd already attracted several incredulous stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, Kiba and Naruto alternately chatted and argued, though their moods remained quite high. Walking beside Kiba, Akamaru occasionally chimed in with his two bits, though of course only Kiba could understand him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah, that never gets old,</i> Akamaru though wryly as Naruto began venting his displeasure at being left out of the conversation, while Kiba merely laughed at his annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they chatted, argued, and laughed, none of them expected to run into the person who greeted them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What'd she say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi shrugged. \"She just said she wants you two to see her as soon as possible.\" He gave Naruto's belly a teasing pat, causing the blonde to flush and Kiba to burst out laughing; even Akamaru wagged his tail. \"Of course, I'm sure she'd understand if you wanted to digest a bit first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, that's alright,\" Naruto stammered, regaining his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked. \"Yeah, we're good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi shrugged again. \"Suit yourselves.\" With that, he turned and strolled off, absorbed in his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba and Naruto looked at each other. \"So,\" Kiba began, beginning to walk with Akamaru's support, \"whaddaya think the Hokage wants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shrugged, taking hold of his stomach and lurching after them. \"Dunno, but Kakashi-sensei said it had to do with our eating skills...\" his face lit up. \"Ooh! Maybe it's a ramen eating contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba rolled his eyes. \"But it could be, I dunno, just a regular eating contest? Seriously, Naruto, you have such a one-track mind....\" Akamaru barked something to him, and he grinned. \"Scratch that, it's a two-track mind: ramen and being Hokage.\" Naruto turned red and spluttered something, but Kiba had managed to put on a burst of speed, so he didn't hear what he said specifically. Cursing, the blonde ninja waddled as fast as he could after them.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed as Naruto squeezed through her door, almost getting his belly caught in the process. Panting, he stood beside Kiba, who had had similar difficulties but had at least had Akamaru to help him. \"Alright, granny, what's this about our eating skills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes narrowing a bit at Naruto's blunt rudeness, Tsunade nonetheless answered. \"There's a small village not too far from here that holds an eating contest every year to bleed off its surplus food; I want you two to enter and win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba glanced at one another. \"They have an eating contest just to get rid of their extra food?\" Kiba asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded. \"Yes; in recent years, the village experienced a recent boom in crop and cattle production, but as it was fairly recent, their population hasn't quite caught up yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I'm complaining, Granny,\" Naruto butted in, annoying both the Hokage and the Inuzuka, \"But why not send Choji? He'd be great for this sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade closed her eyes and folded her hands over her desk. \"He was my first choice, but he's currently on a mission with his team; he won't be back for a few days. One more thing...I know you may not like it, but I'd appreciate if a decent portion of your winnings was given to the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba's eyes widened, and their mouths contorted into scowls. \"Huh?! Why?!\" Kiba demanded, Akamaru growling to help him get his point across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed. \"I was hoping not to tell you, but the village has made some...unwise investments, and I'd like to repair at least some of the damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Naruto leaned over to Kiba and whispered, \"Basically, she blew a ton of the village's money on gambling.\" Kiba smirked in return, until he saw the piercing look Tsunade was giving them. Shushing Naruto (much to the blonde's annoyance), he quickly stood back to attention. \"Al-alright, we'll save some of the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded. \"Very good...but there's one last detail I need to share with the two of you.\" Seeing she had the two's attention, she pressed on slowly. \"The way the contest works, the younger the contestant, the higher the cash prizes are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tilted his head, confused. \"Huh? What're you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, however, had caught onto what she was saying immediately. \"Oh, you've gotta be kidding...\" Akamaru whimpered, though in truth he was feeling oddly...glad about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wasn't too far behind Kiba. \"Wait a sec! Are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded, pulling two bottles of liquid out from under her desk. \"For this mission, you'll be required to regress your bodies in order to maximize the cash prize. The minimum age for the contest, but if you simply wish to return to the age at which you two first became Genin, that will be acceptable as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stared at the bottles of liquid. \"And...that's the bark extract we ran into problems with a couple years back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hokage shook her head. \"Good guess, but no. This is a specially-designed compound normally used for stealth missions, but it's useful for missions such as these as well. Don't worry, all you have to do is make this hand sign,\" she made the Tiger sign, \"and you'll immediately return to your proper age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at the bottles apprehensively. \"Granny, do we really have to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Tsunade replied in a tone that brooked no argument. Grabbing the bottles, she got up and placed them in Naruto and Kiba's hands. \"Now, if you only want to go back a few years, drink half. If you want to go all the way and become 8-year-old children, drink it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-OK...\" Kiba mumbled, looking at the vial in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Tsunade returned to her desk. \"You leave tomorrow morning; pack appropriately. Drink those tonight if possible. Don't worry, you won't be stuck sleeping with massive stomachs on smaller bodies; they'll shrink in proportion to how much you shrink.\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, Kiba sat up in his bed, scowling at the vial in his hand. Akamaru was curled up on Kiba's bed, looking at Kiba with worry, but also a strange sense of excitement that he couldn't quite explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to his fast metabolism, Kiba's gut had partially digested, and thus only a bit of skin stuck out from under his shirt, though his stomach still protruded somewhat noticeably. And besides, it probably wouldn't matter, considering what he was about to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sighed, looking closer at the vial and trying to make a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he only drank half and become the age he was when he graduated the academy, he'd still be able to defend himself if things went south. On the other hand, if he drank it all, he'd still have Akamaru to protect him and Naruto, and besides, it could be sorta fun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of deliberation, Kiba uncorked the vial, having decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Akamaru watched, amazed, as Kiba began shrinking at a noticeable pace, laughing the entire time. His skin became softer and smoother, as his entire body shrank in proportion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands, which were getting smaller and smaller, disappearing into his long-sleeved night shirt.

Starting, Kiba looked down from his perch towards the source of the voice, grinning at what his eyes found. \"Hey, Naruto! You go all the way, too?\" He hopped off Akamaru, coming face-to-face with the little blonde boy, about the same age he was right now, in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Naruto-wearing orange cargo shorts and a short-sleeved blue shirt with spiral drawn all over it-raised his fist in the air. \"Heh, you bet!\" Smirking in return, Kiba returned the fist bump. \"After how much fun we had last time, there was no way I was gonna pass this up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back, Kiba rubbed the back of his head, smiling. \"Yeah, that's what I was thinkin' too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued to giggle, folding his arms behind his head. \"Ooh, this is gonna be so much fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two chatted excitedly, Akamaru watched them, wagging his tail. They both seemed so happy, so carefree...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelping in shock, both boys stopped and spun around to face Tsunade. \"H-heh; sorry, Granny,\" Naruto replied, smiling sheepishly and rubbing the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of herself, Tsunade smiled. \"It's alright, Naruto; we just need to get moving is all.\" She cleared her throat again, all business. \"Now, seeing as how you both ingested all of the compound, I've had to make some special arrangements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba tilted his head. \"Eh? What kind of arrangements?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade pinched the bridge of her nose; they weren't going to like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing as how you've both fully regressed into 8-year-old children, I thought it would be a good idea to send  someone with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Naruto and Kiba exclaimed, eyes widening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was the first one to step up and voice his complaints. \"Granny, we're still ninjas! We can take care of ourselves; we don't need anyone to babysit us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade looked away, looking slightly pained. \"Maybe, but I doon't want to take that chance; the fact is, you're weaker when you're like this, and more mentally fragile, even if you don't realize it right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndignant, Kiba spoke up. \"Y-yeah? Well, we'll get through it just fine! Besides,\" he turned to the side, grinning at Akamaru. \"We'll have Akamaru around to protect us!\" Laughing, he hugged the dog's neck, and Akamaru felt an intense surge of joy; he couldn't resist licking the side of Kiba's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade watched the two, not feeling like arguing but needing to get her point across, and contemplating how to do so. Finally, it came to her; it was underhanded, and she wasn't looking forward to doing it, but she had to show what sorts of things could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Tsunade spoke up. \"What if Akamaru gets infected with a virus that makes him feral?\" Gasping, Kiba looked up at Tsunade, though his arms were still wrapped around his neck. Akamaru yelped and looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, surprised at her choice of words, blinked. \"Eh? You mean like that time a few years ago, when you had me tailing him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded. \"Exactly like that. He grew ill, attacked his comrades, and had we not been able to administer a cure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud sniff suddenly sounded across the room. Recognizing it's source, Naruto turned towards it. \"Kiba? Is something...\" his eyes widened as he got a look at Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little dog-nin was shaking, his arms growing tighter around Akamaru's neck. His bottom lip was trembling, and tears were starting to collect in his eyes. \"K-Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba didn't reply, having just realized the reaction he was having. True, that incident a few years ago was something he'd rather forget: watching Akamaru suffer, trying to find a cure, almost losing him... but he'd long since filed that unpleasant memory away. Brought out into the open, though, and in a state like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to take it anymore, Akamaru nuzzled Kiba, wrapping one of his forelegs around him. <i>Easy, Kiba, easy; we got out of it OK, and I got vaccinated against it; I'm not going anywhere.</i> His reassuring words seemed to ease Kiba's nerves a bit; his stopped shaking, but the accumulated tears had begun to trace their way down his face, and he pulled in closer to Akamaru. Growling, Akamaru looked up at Tsunade. <i>Hey, lady, ya mind telling us what that was about?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, though he didn't speak dog, had a good idea of what the ninken was saying. \"Yeah, what didja do that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed. \"I'm sorry, I really am,\" she replied in a genuinely apologetic tone. \"I just didn't know how else to hammer it through that you were vulnerable like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but Akamaru's not going to get infected again?\" Kiba piped up, looking up from Akamaru's fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hokage smiled and shook her head. \"Incredibly unlikely; he's been vaccinated against those sorts of viruses, so he should be safe.\" Kiba's face lit up at this, and he nuzzled against Akamaru's head. The dog barked happily and nuzzled him back. <i> Told ya. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy to see that that particular hurdle was taken care of, Tsunade spoke again. \"That is not the only reason I'm sending someone to accompany you, though; considering how energetic you two are at your proper ages, there's every chance you might get distracted by someone and wander off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping his eyes, Kiba frowned. \"Hey, we'll be able to concentrate just fine! We---\" His nostrils expanded, and a wide smile suddenly came across his face. \"Ooh, do ya smell that, Akamaru?\" Walking towards the window, he continued sniffing. \"Mmm, it smells like someone's making barbecue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Tsunade could not resist smiling. Naruto, however, looked disgruntled. Pouting, he folded his arms. \"Oh, way to prove her point, dog-breath. You...\" His eyes widened as something zipped by the window. \"Hey, did ya see the size of that bird that flew by!\" He ran up to the window, opening it and standing on his tip-toes. \"It was huge! I...\" He ground to a halt as he realized what he'd been doing. His face flushed, and he looked down at the ground. Kiba seemed to come to a similar realization, having stopped sniffing and flushing in a similar way, rubbing the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist, Tsunade chuckled briefly, but quickly composed herself. \"Seeing as how that's the case...\" She called out the door. \"You can come in now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba's eyes widened; even Akamaru whined in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata?!\" Both children exclaimed. The meek Hyuuga simply smiled and nodded. Soon, though, their new childish minds quickly overrode their shock, and their faces split into huge grins. Quicker than Hinata could blink, they rushed towards her and hugged her tightly. Seeing a little Naruto hug-well, more like squeeze-her, Hinata flushed a deep pink. Akamaru, not to be left out, trotted over to Hinata and nuzzled her side, rewarding him with a dainty pat on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at the sight, Tsunade nonetheless pressed on. \"Hinata has her things set; you'll set out immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short time, the four had departed the village gates, heading for their mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In addition, under Akamaru's watch, Kiba and Naruto stayed fairly well behaved, though they did chase each other around occasionally, giggling in delight the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the village, and they found it riddled with banners advertising for the eating contest. Because of this, it wasn't hard to find the registration table, where Hinata registered the two children. The receptionist was surprised by how young Kiba and Naruto were, but she nonetheless smiled warmly, giving both boys, and Akamaru, or course, pats on the head, thanking them for helping the village with their food problem. Unfortunately, Akamaru wasn't allowed compete in the actual competition and win, but he was still welcome to his own food from the competition if he wanted any. He just wouldn't be a part of the competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Tsunade had already sent a letter to the hotel the night before, reserving the room for the three. Tsunade knew the hotel owner well, and he owed her a favor, so he gave the four a room for free. Hinata got her own bed, while Kiba and Naruto had to share the other bed. Once Hinata said this to the two, they immediately began bickering, as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I gotta sleep in the same bed as dog breath?\" Naruto complained, causing Kiba to yell, \"I don't like it either! I don't wanna share my bed with anyone, especially not that idiot!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore it got too out of hand, Hinata timidly spoke up, \"Why do you two butt heads all the time?

Besides, Akamaru will be with us! You can see how comfy his fur is!\" Naruto smiled as he heard this, and he began petting Akamaru, saying \"Wow, that is comfy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the four had already arrived at the room, opening it to reveal two large beds, a closet, and the door to a clean bathroom with fancy marble counter tops and a marble bathtub and shower.

Once all three had been seated (with Akamaru beside Kiba on the floor, of course), he handed out three menus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three ordered their drinks-Hinata a simple glass of water, Naruto some juice, and Kiba some soda-and thanked the man, and as he walked away, they began poring over the menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be careful not to eat too much,\" Hinata softly advised, looking through the menu. \"The eating contest's tomorrow, and I don't want either of you getting sick beforehand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba lowered his menu, beaming. \"Heh, thanks, Hinata! Don't worry; we won't go overboard.\" His eyes returned to the menu, his gaze falling upon the meat section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto giggled, poring through the menu and finding a large bowl of ramen with a lot of toppings. \"Still, we're hungry, so whatever we get, it's gonna be big!\" Flipping the menu around, he displayed the picture of the ramen. \"This is what I'm getting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Kiba turned his own menu around, revealing a rather large steak. \"Not bad, Naruto, but that's nothing compared to this!\" Akamaru whined, and Kiba flashed his canine friend a grin. \"Don't worry, Akamaru, I'll get one for you too!\" The dog barked happily, wagging his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the waiter had returned with their drinks, and they'd each placed their order: Hinata ordered a simple salad with a few strips of meat, Kiba ordered a rather sizable steak, and Naruto ordered the bowl of ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a matter of minutes, the waiter returned, bearing their meals. Hinata politely thanked him as he set hers down in front of her, but Naruto and Kiba merely grinned widely as the steaming bowl of ramen and big, juicy steak were set in front of them. Akamaru, at least, barked his thanks as his own steak was set before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled. \"Let me know if there's anything else I can get for you.\" With that, he turned and walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba didn't waste any time: clasping their hands together and uttering a happy cry of \"Itadakimasu!\", they grabbed their chopsticks and fork and knife, respectively, and began digging in. Akamaru wasn't too far behind them, already chomping down on his steak. Hinata, watching with a little bit of shock, absentmindedly began picking at her own meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba attacked their meals with gusto, the grins never leaving their faces. \"Mmm!\" Naruto exclaimed after slurping up a particularly large helping of noodles and toppings. \"This is really yummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba nodded, tearing off a piece of his steak and sticking it in his mouth. \"And this steak is really tender and juicy too!\" He chewed it and swallowed it, quickly cutting off another piece. Akamaru, having taken a huge bite out of his steak, licked his chops and dove back in, backing up Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata watched the two eat, a smile on her face; as surprising as their eagerness was, there was something undeniably...<i>cute</i> about the whole thing. Whether it was Kiba, her dear friend a teammate, completely and utterly enjoying himself as he forked bite after bite of succulent steak into his mouth, or Naruto, the boy she had loved and admired for so long, in complete bliss as he slurped up his favorite dish, the surprise over seeing the two like this was quickly replaced by a warm sensation in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing this, Akamaru looked up from his steak and wagged his tail upon seeing Hinata's expression. <i>Welcome to the club, Hinata.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the boys let their utensils clatter to the table, and they leaned back in their seats, patting their stomachs. Hinata, having already finished hers, continued to watch the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, that was good!\" Naruto exclaimed, closing his eyes and letting his tongue stick out the side of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it,\" Kiba responded, letting out a little burp and giggling, flushing a bit when he realized what he was doing. \"We should probably stop now, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, licking his chops after having finished his steak, looked at the two. <i>Heh; that's probably a good idea.</i> Though they had only had one dish each, the sheer size of each had ensured it would have some effect on their stomachs: specifically, they had rounded out considerably, making a noticeable imprint on their shirts. However, they still remained hidden from the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata, politely dabbing at her mouth with a napkin, addressed the two. \"Did you two have a good meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto massaged his belly. \"Uh-huh!\" Without warning, he suddenly let loose with a loud yawn. \"Kinda sleepy, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, having just finished his own yawn, smacked his lips. \"Yeah; I could probably go for a nap, too.\" Hinata smiled warmly at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter came back, depositing their check. Leaving the money on the table, Hinata stood up from her chair; sluggishly, the two boys leaped out of their chairs, staggering a bit but quickly righting themselves. Akamaru got up to walk beside Kiba; the two weren't ridiculously bloated, so he probably wouldn't need to act as a crutch, but it never hurt to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way back to their room, Naruto and Kiba rubbing their bellies with both hands on the while, giving content sighs and occasionally burping, which only made the two giggle and Hinata's face heat up a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they reached their room, and Naruto and Kiba scattered towards their own personal luggage, rummaging through until they came back out with their favored pajamas: in Naruto's case, it was simply cotton sweatpants with a short-sleeved black pajama shirt. Kiba, on the other hand, wore a two-piece pajama outfit, colored red with a large bone on the front and back of the shirt. In addition, his pajama pants bore numerous little bones on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey squabbled a bit over who would use the bathroom first to change, but Hinata had eventually stepped in with a polite suggestion: the bathtub had a curtain, so they could both go in and change without feeling uncomfortable. The two had been quick to take this suggestion, grabbing their pajamas and darting into the bathroom. Once they were both out of sight, Hinata took the opportunity to change into her own night clothes: specifically, an set of white silk pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Naruto and Kiba emerged, both clad in their respective pajamas, both yawning. Wagging his tail, Akamaru hopped up on their bed, curling his body so both of them could rest against him. Unable to keep from giggling, Naruto and Kiba ran towards the bed, climbing up and nestling deep against Akamaru's fur: Kiba elected to sleep against his chest, while Naruto elected to take his stomach. Sitting up, he waved at Hinata. \"G'night, Hinata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlushing a bit, Hinata waved back. \"G-good night, Naruto; good night, Kiba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stuck his arm up in the air and waved. \"'Night!\" He rolled over to face Naruto. \"G'night, Naruto; g'night, Akamaru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Naruto yawned again. \"'Night, Kiba; 'night, Akamaru.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the good nights taken care of, they rolled back over so they were facing away from each other. Within minutes, they were snoring gently, fast asleep. Akamaru looked down at them fondly before he, too, laid his head down and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling warmly at the sight, Hinata climbed into her own bed and closed her eyes. They had a big day tomorrow, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen next she opened her eyes, there was sunlight streaming in through the windows. Sitting up, she rubbed her eyes and looked over towards Naruto and Kiba's bed. They were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Either way, when everything was said and done, Naruto wore that pair of black shorts and with it, an orange shirt with a black Konoha symbol on it. Kiba wore a pair of blue shorts with a red shirt that also had a black Konoha symbol. They both had decided to represent their village, hence the shirts.

Whoever could eat the most food in the time given would, of course, be the winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the judge gave everyone the OK to start, Naruto and Kiba rushed to the buffet, grabbed plates, and began loading them up with everything they laid eyes on. In the meantime, Hinata and Akamaru chose one of the provided table to settle down in, making sure there were two spare seats for the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, all the contestants had gotten their first plates filled and weighed, and they began staggering back to their seats under the weight of their plates. Likewise, Kiba and Naruto struggled towards the table, their plates similarly laden. Hinata gasped, and Akamaru whined; the food on the plates reached at least a couple feet into the air, and it was loaded with everything from noodles, dango, and bean buns to cookies, cake, pie, and everything else in-between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the table, they set their platters down, making an impact Hinata noticed. Licking their lips, they seated themselves, grabbed their utensils, and with a cry of \"Itadakimasu!\", they dug in, Naruto forking huge mouthfuls of noodles into his mouth and interspersing it with gulps of juice that had been provided, with Kiba alternately taking bites of chicken legs and dango.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata stared, \"eep\"-ing a little bit at the speed and energy with which the boys tackled their first plates. Akamaru, on the other hand, stared a bit longingly at Kiba; he knew Kiba had had his hands full with his huge plate, but he could at least have waited a bit and gotten him a little something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though on cue, a waiter came by their table and laid large plate laden with huge steaks in front of Akamaru. Gaping, Akamaru looked at Kiba; even as he went to town, he caught Akamaru's gaze and winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru barked in return, wagging his tail; to think he'd doubted Kiba for a second. Licking his chops, he returned his attention to his platter, took a deep whiff, opened his jaws, and began taking huge bites out of it; however, he took his time, since he wasn't exactly on a schedule...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes ticked boy, the massive piles of food on Naruto and Kiba's plates slowly dwindled in height. Owing to the ridiculous amount piled on, however, Naruto and Kiba's stomachs had already begun to change, becoming noticeably round and making a distinct imprint against their shirts, which, very gradually, grew more apparent as the plates dwindled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata, nibbling on a cinnamon roll that had been brought to the table (also at Kiba's request), stared on, not sure whether she should be worried about the two making themselves sick or amazed at how they put the food away. Akamaru, leisurely eating his steaks, glanced at the two, equally conflicted; on the one hand, he worried about them, but on the other hand, the way in which the grinned and giggled as they ate, and generally seemed to be having <i>fun{/}, he couldn't help but wag his tail.</i></span></div></div>",

Grabbing a plate, he staggered over to the meat section and loaded his plate up with the biggest, juiciest steaks he could find. Once they were loaded up to his satisfaction, he made his way back to the table, where Naruto had already started on one of his two plates. Glaring at the Uzumaki, he shook it off for the moment and made his way over to the dog, who was finishing the last of his steaks. Looking up and licking his chops, he wagged his tail at the sight of the steaks piled on the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned. \"Here ya go, Akamaru!\" Slowly bending at the knees (owing to his growing stomach), he gently set the plate in front of the dog, giggling as Akamaru licked his cheek in thanks. \"Ya need anything else, just lemme know!\" At Akamaru's affirmative bark, he ruffled the dog's head and returned to his seat, picking up a fork. Glaring at Naruto, who was continuing to dig into the first of his two plates, he attacked his own first plate with a startling burst of speed, shoveling noodles, meat, and assorted stir-fried veggies into his maw. With the other hand, he grabbed various hand food-chicken wings, fried dumplings, cookies, and the like-shoving them inside his mouth simultaneously. Soon, he had caught up to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey glared at each other out the corner of their eyes...only to burst into giggles, almost spraying their food everywhere. Composing themselves, they leaped back into the fray, cramming their mouths full of everything they could get their hands and utensils on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata watched, awestruck, as their bellies continued to grow the more they crammed into them. Up, up, up their shirts went, until their navels finally exposed themselves for the whole world to see. Sensing this, the boys swallowed their current mouthfuls  and looked down at their bellies, seeing the pits in the middle of their midsections. Getting an idea, they continued to shovel food into their mouths with one hand, playing around with their navels with the other. Naruto wriggled his finger around in his, giggling through his mouthfuls, while Kiba merely let his mouth stretch into a dopey grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they tired of this and returned their full attention to their first plates, and their bellies resumed their slow but steady growth, their shirts slowly rising further above their navels and their bellies pressing harder and harder against the buttons of their shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout halfway through their current plates (they had packed a ton on them, so they were still on the first of the two they had brought to the table,) they both stopped to take a breather, patting their bellies proudly as they licked their lips. \"Oh man, this stuff is awesome!\" Naruto exclaimed, burping and giggling a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba massaged his belly happily. \"Yeah!\" He winced as he felt a tightness in his waist. \"Gut's startin' to make my shorts tight, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned as he felt the same pressure. \"Huh, mine too.

As the piles of food on their plates continued to shrink, their stomachs grew, forcing their shirts further up and slowly opening their flies, bringing blushes to their faces even as they giggled at the sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, their plates had been utterly cleaned, and both young boys leaned back, rubbing their stomachs. \"Phew,\" Naruto burped, licking his lips, \"this village really knows how to make some yummy stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba massaged his own belly, sighing contentedly. \"Yeah, and there's so much of it! I can't believe we're getting paid for this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata simply stared at the state the boys were in now. Their bellies now stuck out even further in front of them, and their shirts now rested directly on top of the globes their tummies had become. Their flies, Hinata noticed with a furious blush, were at least halfway down, the cloth of whatever undergarments they were wearing peeking out from the openings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to simply let this go, Hinata spoke up. \"Um...Naruto, Kiba? Your, er, zippers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. \"Eh?\" He felt around the opening, a goofy grin forming on his face as he did so. \"Heh, thought I felt something funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK, Hinata,\" Kiba added, wiggling his finger in his belly button (he looked like an idiot, but he figured this was as good an opportunity as any.) \"Naruto and I do this all the time when we eat a ton.\" He grinned, his eyes closing. \"It feels funny, but in a good way.\" Lifting his hands off his stomach, he pulled his second plate towards him, picked up his utensils, and began going to town on it. Naruto scowled. \"Oh, real funny, Kiba,\" he grumbled, picking up his own utensils and digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the time they'd spent rubbing their bellies and chatting with Hinata had allowed them to realize exactly how full they were. Therefore, it was at a much slower pace that they ate, taking longer to chew before swallowing, taking smaller bites of their food, and waiting a bit between dishes, costing precious seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata watched, worried. \"Are you two feeling OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping down a mouthful of noodles, Naruto gave a weak grin. \"Y-yeah; the food's just more filling than I thought.\" Kiba simply belched loudly, starting to look a bit queasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing this, Akamaru looked up from his steaks, ignoring the fact that his belly was growing ever closer to the floor. <i>C'mon, guys, don't give up now! You're doin' great!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a drink of soda, Kiba looked down at Akamaru. \"I know, boy, but I'm starting to feel full; I don't know if I can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Does it hurt?</i> Akamaru suddenly barked, fixing Kiba with a determined stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blinked, surprised by the question. \"N-no; my stomach's feeling tight, but it doesn't really hurt. It might start soon, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>As much as it did when you had to stab yourself in the gut to get that freak outta you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's eyes widened; though Akamaru had been unconscious, he'd heard from Kiba of that Sound Ninja's freaky molecular fusion jutsu, and how he'd risked mortally wounding himself to hurt his enemy. It had hurt like hell--kunais through flesh tended to have that effect--but Akamaru had been in danger, and he'd had no intention of going down like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then thought of the times when he'd truly stuffed himself to bursting. It had hurt, and he'd felt sick...but it was nothing compared to that incident. He took a moment to examine himself; though his gut was feeling uncomfortable, it wasn't even <i>close</i> to bursting yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked back down at Akamaru, grinning. \"Thanks, boy.\" With that, he turned back to his plate and dove back in with renewed vigor. Naruto, gaping a bit at his newfound energy, nonetheless forced himself to catch up; there was no way he was falling behind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, both boys had re-established their momentum, shoveling food in their mouths even as their stomachs continued to grow, their flies continued to open, and the seams on the sides of their shirts began to strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru smirked a canine smirk. <i>There we go; knew ya had it in ya.</i> With that, Akamaru returned his attention to his steaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Naruto and Kiba had polished off what was left of their second plates, and had now started on the new plates that Hinata had brought them. The dog's eyes widened at how big their stomachs had gotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, wow,</i> Akamaru marveled to himself, looking at the states the two were in. <i>Guts are touchin' the table, and they're still going strong.</i> His gaze went towards the sides of their shirts, which had ripped a bit. <i>Shirt seams are busting, too; they ain't even slowing down!</i> He wagged his tail; normally, he'd be worried about the two, but since this was an official mission, he found himself genuinely enjoying watching the boys stuff themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched, intrigued, as the boys' guts gradually expanded, pushing harder against the table and causing it to creak a bit. In addition, more of their shirt seams began straining (luckily, their guts were only putting pressure on the seams under the armpit; that way, their shirts would at least stay on), and, as more and more food entered their gullets, those seams began popping one by one. And, though he couldn't quite see it just yet, there was a ripping sound every now and then that he was sure denoted their inseams continuing to rip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, before long, he could see cloth peeking out from inside Naruto and Kiba's ripping shorts; yellow cloth from Kiba's, white from Naruto's. He barked, wagging his tail; seeing as how he didn't have to worry about them going overboard, he found it actually sorta funny when their undies started showing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, both boys started to notice how tight their bellies were becoming against the table. Grunting, they struggled in their seats, trying to scoot backward. Sure enough, they managed to scoot a few inches away from the table; their stomachs were still pressing considerably against it, but the pressure was a good deal less than it was. Nodding in satisfaction, the boys continued to dig in, their stomachs continuing to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru watched, awestruck, as they pressed on. <i>Man, they're really serious about this, aren't they?</i> On an odd whim, he took a look at their belly buttons; in spite of the size of their midsections, their navels remained small pits in their stomachs. With the rate they were packing it away, though, they probably wouldn't stay that way for long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to reduce the food left on their plates, their bellies continued to press against the table, and Akamaru was sure he heard creaking. At the same time, their navels appeared to be thinning. <i>Eeyup; those are gonna pop any second now.</i> As soon as he thought this, the table let out another creak, and this time it was continuous. Akamaru winced. <i>Either that, or the table's gonna give first...</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, to their surprise, he had also asked to speak to the two of them. Confused but intrigued, the boys had eagerly agreed. Now, they stood in the man's office, Hinata waiting outside just in case things got ugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled. \"Well, I must say I'm impressed, boys; never met anyone your age who had your appetites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba beamed, showing his teeth in a wide smile. \"Eh, what can I say? We've had lotsa practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Naruto added, sticking his tongue out to the side to get at some morsel of food on his cheek. \"We compete against each other all the time! Really builds up our appetites!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's eyes fell on their swollen bellies, ripped shirts, and mangled shorts. \"I can certainly believe that,\" he replied playfully. \"With that in mind, I wanted to ask if you two wanted to help me with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys shared a look. \"What kinda thing do ya need help with?\" Naruto piped up, burping slightly and giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" the village head replied, \"As you know, the whole reason we hold this contest is because the village has an excess of food, more than it needs to sustain itself or even trade. That's why...\" He smiled at this. \"...I would like your help in further lessening our excess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Further help?\" Kiba repeated, while Akamaru just whined. \"You mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the man nodded. \"For the next several days, I want the two of you to eat as much as you can; I'll even pay you more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba's eyes lit up. \"Really?!\" they both exclaimed at once. At the man's affirmative nod, they beamed. \"Count us in!\" Naruto exclaimed, licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Kiba added. He winced as a sharp bolt of pain went through his gut. \"Uh, but can we rest up first? Our guts kinda hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village head chuckled. \"Certainly; I don't need you two to begin until tomorrow, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a cheer, Kiba and Naruto high-fived each other...and promptly yelped in embarrassment when those sides of their shorts fell down, exposing Kiba's white briefs and Naruto's green boxers. Laughing nervously, they pulled them back up, thanked the man, and waited for Akamaru to struggle back to his feet. Once he had, the three of them slowly made their way out of the office to explain everything to Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much later, they made their way back to their hotel room, Naruto and Kiba changing into (currently rather ill-fitting) pajamas, the same they'd worn the previous night. Bidding Hinata good night, they immediately fell asleep curled against Akamaru, the gentle rise and fall of his white-furred  belly lulling them to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

Soon enough, Naruto was clad in a pair of orange sweatpants and a white t-shirt with an orange Konoha symbol on it. Packing sweatpants was one of his smarter moves, as it gave his belly much more room, but he still had a feeling that even the sweatpants would not be enough to contain his soon-to-be stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba had also packed sweatpants, and he chose to wear his black pair, ensuring that he wouldn't be quite so uncomfortable when he stuffed himself silly. With the sweatpants, he wore a plain grey t-shirt. It wasn't too presentable, but Kiba was aiming for comfort more than presentation today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, the two raced each other to the village head's office with Akamaru and Hinata trailing behind. Soon enough, they met the village head, who was waiting outside, and he greeted them pleasantly, chuckling at their goofy antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you two,\" he began. \"First I'd like to thank you for taking the time to help my village. As long as you two are ready, we have a place set up for you two, and the same team of chefs we had yesterday.

Opening the door, the village head indicated for Naruto and Kiba to follow him, which they did eagerly, Hinata and Akamaru following close behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This restaurant's usually closed on this day of the week,\" the man explained as he led them through. \"However, I've made a special allowance for you two.\" He stopped at a nicely-sized table. \"If you wouldn't mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys didn't need any second bidding; grinning, they clambered up into the seats, sitting across from one another. Hinata, as she wasn't eating ,simply elected to pull up a chair and sit near the table so she could keep an eye on them. Akamaru, obviously, laid down near Kiba's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled. \"The chefs should be out with your first courses in a few minutes; each serving will have some of everything, but if there's something in specific you want, just let us know.\" Both young boys nodded eagerly, smiling widely. Chuckling, the village head traveled to the back, presumably to get their orders started up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, several chefs brought several plates to the table, each overflowing with all kinds of treats: dumplings, noodles, meat, desserts, and the like. Naruto and Kiba's eyes lit up as their eyes fell upon the plates. Loudly thanking them, the boys picked up their utensils, and as soon as their plates were set on the table, they each pulled one in front of them and began digging in with gusto. Akamaru watched the two, more than a little worried, but a waiter thoughtfully deposited a plate of steaks in front of him. Sniffing, his mouth began watering, and it wasn't long before he, too, was digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata, who had eaten before they'd gotten there, simply watched the three going at it with a mixture of shock and amazement. Even after the events of the day before, the speed and eagerness with which they ate still surprised her. And, as the minutes ticked by, they showed no signs of stopping or slowing down.</span></div></div>",

As a result, their bellies proceeded outwards, quickly beginning to lift their shirts up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each passing bite, the bellies of the two pushed outwards, lifting their shirts up more an more. Soon enough, their navels were open to the world, and they still had about an inch of exposed belly above. At this point, they were finished with their plates, and a waiter went to refill them, asking for requests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto asked for anything with noodles, hopefully ramen, and Kiba asked for everything meat related.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the server brought back a bowl of ramen that was the size of a large cooking pot for Naruto, and for Kiba, a huge platter of meat topped with steaks, sausages, ham, bacon, and even a whole chicken at the center. The two gratefully thanked their server before they proceeded with their feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shoveled noodles into his mouth, and as he did so, his shirt continued to be driven further upward. Kiba's shirt did the same as he tore through a steak, not even bothering with utensils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru was doing the same, and the damage was already showing itself, as his belly pushed outwards, distending considerably, giving him the appearance of being pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the bellies of the two had pushed their shirts all the way up, and because of the elasticity of their sweatpants, they were still comfortable, and there was still much more room to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was soon finished with his steaks, and he moved on to the ham as the bellies of the two got closer and closer to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Kiba was done with the ham, Naruto was finished with all his noodles as the bellies of the two were only an inch from the table. Akamaru had also eaten quite a bit in terms of steaks, and his belly was getting closer and closer to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, with the noodles finished, Naruto grinned as he sealed his lips around the cooking pot. He proceeded to tip the cooking pot over, a massive amount of broth rolling down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly dropped the pot, almost causing it to spill, but Hinata was able to catch it in time. Either way, he screamed, \"HOT! HOT!!!\" as he reached for a glass of ice water to sooth his discomfort. It wasn't really that hot, but, as he was younger, Naruto's pain tolerance was much less. Kiba couldn't help but giggle a bit as Naruto's face reddened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata then began comforting Naruto, saying \"It's alright, Naruto. It'll cool down in a while. Are you ok?\" All the while, she was blushing a vibrant red, but the others ignored it, as that was typical for Hinata whenever she talked to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, saying \"Thanks Hinata.\" inadvertently causing her to blush even more. He waited surprisingly patiently for the broth to cool down. Being Naruto, he thought of a way to hasten the process and had a couple of shadow clones blow on the broth to cool it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Kiba was well into his sausages, stuffing them down his greedy maw as he grinned contentedly, his legs swinging joyously as he consumed his favorite form of meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Hinata and Akamaru smiled, and couldn't help but feel that warm feeling somewhere in their chests as they watched the antics of the two boys. Hinata looked at Akamaru, who merely nodded, as if to say, \"I know that feeling all to well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Naruto was ready, and he tipped the pot of broth into his gaping maw. Hinata held the bottom just to make sure Naruto wouldn't drop it. At the same time, Kiba was about finished with his sausages, and he moved onto his bacon. His belly was now barely brushing against the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Naruto gained some momentum, and his belly began to inflate slowly like a water balloon. Kiba even stopped for a moment to watch the spectacle, and was amazed as Naruto's belly reached the table in record time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued to guzzle down the broth, his stomach now bisected by the table as it put more and more pressure on the poor table, causing it to put more pressure on Kiba's belly. It was even getting big enough to stretch the waistband of Naruto's sweatpants. Finally, Naruto stopped, letting out a titanic belch that shook the table. It even shook Kiba, who's belly was now somewhat wedged into the table that Naruto's belly pushed into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was a bit dazed, and took a break to let Kiba catch up. Kiba did, motivated to match Naruto's belly with his own. He stuffed stacks of bacon into his maw, enjoying the salty, smokey flavors. Once he was done, all that was left was the whole chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, being an Inuzuka, had teeth like knives, and he didn't need to carve the turkey as he could do it himself with his hands and teeth. He began by ripping out the legs, and with one in each hand, he cleaned all the meat off expertly. He then did the same with the wings, and all that was left was the bird itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba easily tore into each breast of the chicken, and he quickly made his way to the bone on each side. He then cleaned up any remaining meat, and left nothing but pure bone as he had completely cleaned the carcass with expert technique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was certainly impressed, and he said, \"You can sure get every last bit of meat!\" Kiba smiled at the complement, saying, \"Yeah, it's something that I picked up from my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Akamaru had continued to eat steak after steak, and at this point, his belly touched the ground, and was threatening to spread his legs, as it had already filled in all the space in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the sudden expansion of the bellies of the two, the table was starting to strain. The waiter came to the table to check up on the two, and...</span></div></div>",

With that, Big Chill froze the three of them knee high so they wouldn't escape, while Julie with the help of Ship fired a blaster at their car and kept the last remaining guy standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After that, Ben and Julie kissed, then said goodbye as he left her at home. Just then, Julie felt Ship in normal form snuggling on her leg. \"I bet you're feeling tired, huh?,\" said Julie as she lifted the cute little alien up with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, she noticed a miniature sumo statue on a shelf over the TV. \"What's this?\" she wondered. She gently put Ship down and walked over to observe the statue. Julie took a closer look and she recognized it's characteristics of a fictional hero named Ishiyama from a video game franchise called Sumo Slammers. But it looked so old and her parents must have spent a lot of money to buy it. But just out of curiosity, she picked up the statue and then it's eyes suddenly shot some form of magic at her! It startled Julie so much, that she nearly dropped the figure, but gently put it back, not knowing what that thing was capable of. Ship was a little worried about Julie so he rushed over to see if she was okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then she felt some weird rumbling in her stomach....</span></div></div>",

His stomach soon reminded him that it was about lunch time, and he hadn't eaten much for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should get somethin' to eat.\" He thought, as his stomach growled even louder, showing Ed that he was downright starving. Soon enough, he was making his way to the center of the village. This was because there was a fall festival in the village today, which was one of the reasons that the Elric brothers were relaxing here in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great!\" Ed thought, \"The festival will have plenty of cheap food, and I've saved up a ton of money. It's been a while since I really ate a good meal.\" He soon arrived at the festival site, ready to feast on some of his favorite foods as a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he was at the first food stand, which sold smoked turkey legs. Soon, Ed had two gargantuan legs, one in each hand, and he tore through them gleefully, enjoying the nostalgic flavors.  Those two were enough to fill up Ed's stomach, but he was nowhere near done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bought two more turkey legs, munching on them as he made his way to the next food stand. His stomach was now protruding outwards ever so slightly as he finished the second turkey leg, getting out money to pay for his next snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then discarded the bone, which was completely clean, before grabbing the next portion of carnival cuisine, which happened to be a plate with five funnel cakes stacked on top of each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was hungry, and excited to taste the next flavors, Ed picked up all five funnel cakes at the same time, opening his mouth as much as possible to take a massive bite that caused his cheeks to bulge. He chewed through the funnel cake gleefully, as a young child would, and soon the bite disappeared down his gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was walking over to another food stand, with the final bites of funnel cake disappearing in his mouth, resting his his stomach, which bulged quite noticeably now, barely starting to push on his t-shirt.</span></div></div>",

Setting them all on an extra-strong paper plate, he grinned again, thanked the befuddled attendant, and continued on. As he walked, he held the plate with one hand (specifically, his automail hand)and grabbed hot dogs with the other one, shoving them, one by one, into his mouth. He chewed each one for a few minutes before swallowing, grinning happily at the taste. As each hot dog went down his gullet, his stomach bulged a little more, pressing a little harder against his shirt with each hot dog that plopped into his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he swallowed the last hot dog, his stomach was a very distinct round shape under his shirt and pressing harder against it. Sighing, Ed smacked his belly, grinning widely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah man, that was great!\" Ed exclaimed, licking his lips. Of course, he was nowhere near done; there were a whole bunch of other foods to try, and he intended to try them all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this end, Ed sought out a stand that made homemade doughnuts and bought an entire bag of them. Walking away, he licked his lips and shoved them, one by one, into his mouth, much like he did with the hot dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs doughnut after doughnut went down his throat, his stomach bulged a little more, stretching his shirt further. By the time he'd reached the end of the bag, his shirt had reached its limit and had started to rise up, exposing a tiny bit of skin. In addition, his waist was starting to feel a bit snug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious, Ed rubbed his stomach, the grin still on his face. \"Wow, the food's really good this year!\" he thought to himself, looking around at the stands he had yet to hit up. \"Let's see, what should I get next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On their menu, they even advertised a \"Party Pie\", which was a gigantic pie meant to be served at large gatherings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd immediately decided on apple, as it was his favorite. He considered ordering a single slice, but his stomach soon told him otherwise, so he was soon ordering an entire apple pie. The cashier was very polite, assuming that Ed was going to bring it home to his family, and soon he handed one of the pies to a hungry Ed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pie, which had a fancy design on the crust, was already sliced, as Ed found out. This was perfect, as he held the pie tin with his automail hand, grabbing out a slice with his other hand. The slice was actually surprisingly stable, and it didn't fall apart as soon as Ed tried to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a bite of the slice, as if he were eating an extra tall pizza slice, and his taste buds were assaulted with a cascade of amazing flavors. It was so amazingly delicious that Ed had actually paused for about 20 seconds, amazed at the wonderful tastes that the pie contained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he began digging in rapidly, greedily stuffing the rest of the slice into his hungry maw, finishing it in less than a minute, leaving a collage of filling around his mouth. He didn't care, however as he swiftly moved onto the next piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he gorged himself on the delicious pastry, his stomach bulged out slightly farther with each slice, lifting up his shirt slightly farther with each bite. Soon he had eaten half of the pie, receiving strange looks from everyone around him, but he was too enthralled by the taste of the fruity treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took out the last slice, downing it just as quickly as the first seven, and he wasn't done yet, as he licked the last remnants of filling and crust in the tin, cleaning it completely. He also licked his hands, then licked his lips, ensuring that he tasted every bit of the pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach was now even more noticeable, and it lifted his shirt halfway up to his bellybutton. It even began to create considerable stress on his pants button. Either way, he belched, rubbing his belly with a goofy, satisfied grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he couldn't help but say out loud...</span></div></div>",

Besides, we're gonna be stuck in Central for a few days, so what could it hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl blinked. \"Are you sure you just don't want an excuse to stuff your face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd laughed nervously, rubbing the back of his head. \"Eh...I'll admit that might be a factor.\" The younger Elric groaned, bringing a palm to his metallic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all started earlier that day, when Ed had had to report in to Colonel Mustang after exhausting another lead on the Philosopher's Stone. There had been much grumbling on the diminutive alchemist's part, and much smirking on the colonel's part, but miraculously, they had gotten through it without Ed losing his temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, when they had gone to the train station to hitch a ride back to Resembool (both to recuperate and to relax a bit,) they had discovered that, due to an unforeseen malfunction in the train's systems, they would have to wait a few days before it was repaired, essentially stranding the two in Central for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwearing, Ed had stormed off, grumbling, with a resigned Al close behind. It wasn't long, though, before Ed's stomach had started growling, and he remembered he hadn't eaten anything since breakfast. With this in mind, he'd set off in search of someplace to eat... and had immediately discovered the exact thing to take his mind off his troubles; specifically, a restaurant that was hosting a contest, in which any takers could come and take on their biggest courses. If they succeeded, they'd be rewarded with a sizable cash prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finding this out, Ed had immediately darted inside and signed himself up. Now, he sat at a table, eagerly awaiting his first course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, it arrived, and it was...</span></div></div>",

Ed's stomach growled louder, almost as if to answer Al, and Ed said, \"Don't worry, I won't go too far <i>this</i> time.\" At that, Al just sat back, resigned, and proceeded to watch the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd, on the other hand, grabbed a fork, and began shoveling pasta into his mouth as quickly as he possibly could, immediately creating a mess of alfredo sauce on his face. He ate for quite a while, undeterred, and after about ten minutes, his stomach was filled, but he was nowhere near finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother ten minutes later, his stomach began protruding outwards, though it was still hiding underneath his shirt.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ed's jaw almost dropped when he saw the sheer quantity of food stacked atop the platter dumped onto his table with a deafening THUD!  Al almost couldn't bare to look.  \"...Tha-that's...quite a lot of food...\" Ed stuttered, still in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother, maybe you should reconsider.  Afterall, there'd be no shame in it!\" Al pleaded from afar.  However, Ed was determined to win that prize money, and if the FullMetal Alchemist can overcome raging Ice Alchemists, Homunculus, and Mustang's condescending attitude for more than six minutes at a time, then surely, a little extra food here and there was nothing!  However, his currently swollen stomach gurgled angrily in disagreement, causing him to wince in pain briefly.  But he regained composure, and immediately began to tear into the Pork Chops.  Al turned away, fearful that his older brother was going to make himself sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while, Ed slowly began to gain a little momentum, biting off huge chunks of meat from the chops, and gulping down hearty mouthfuls.  One by one, the chops were stripped of their meat and reduced to a pile of bones on the side of the platter, and the larger the pile got, the larger Ed's stomach got.  It had bloated so much that it had risen up and began to expose Ed's bare stomach slightly.  Al eventually turned back to his brother, and much to his surprise, the stubborn elder Elric just kept chomping away.  \"C\"mon, brother.  You can do this...\" said Al quietly and cautiously optimistic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ed finished the last pork chop and leaned back, with both hands clutching his bloated belly.  Al looked back at him with concern.  \"Brother!  Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh, yeah, just need to make a little room before I can finish the rest of this stuff...\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl's question was answered in the form of a huge, lengthy belch which erupted forcefully out of Ed's mouth.  By the time Ed's burp came to an end, he smacked his lips, and patted his belly happily.  Al's palm slammed into his metallic helmet of a face from embarrassment, while the other spectators reactions ranged from disgusted, to embarrassed uneasy laughter, to on the floor, laughing the sides off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that there's a bit of extra room, let's rock!\" said Ed with a bit more life in his voice as he started scarfing down the mashed potatoes at quick pace.  A good amount ended up on the sides of his lips and on the table as he just kept shoveling more and more into his mouth, despite his fullness.  One hand rested atop his gut, which continued to expand ever so slightly with each mouthful of potatoes gulped down.  Consolidating, Ed started to mix his veggies with his massive pile of potatoes to knock them both out at once, which naturally made Al uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, Brother?  Are you sure you're not trying to eat a little too much at once?\" asked Al nervous for his brother's sake.  Upon gulping down another mouthful, Ed sighed and said, \"Sure it is!  I'll knock them both out and get them done with sooner!  Besides, veggies by themselves?!  Noooo thank you...\" responded Ed, causing his metallic brother to sweat drop with embarrassment about his brothers childish hatred for vegetables.  And so, he continued to mix green beans, carrots, corn, and peas in with his massive pile of spuds, and then proceeded to take his spoon and wolf down as much as his mouth could fit, occasionally causing his cheeks to bulge out comically as he would gulp down hearty mouthfuls at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes passed, and Ed's stomach had bloated up, with his shirt now exposing a good amount of flesh, only covering his belly button and up, exposing just how much food the young Alchemist had ingested.  Finally, he had successfully finished every last drop of mashed potatoes and vegetables.  Stuffed beyond comprehension, Ed burped wetly and groaned in pain as he began to massage his aching stomach, fully aware that he wasn't out of the woods just yet.  The sound of another waiter approaching with yet another hearty platter of food caught the ears of all spectators. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, Al looked and said, \"Umm, Brother?  I don't think it's over y-\"<br>\r\n\"I KNOW, ALPHONSE!  THANK YOU!\" shouted an angry Ed in response.  He slowly turned to see what he was up against, and couldn't help but whimper...</span></div></div>",

On that platter, ten massive steaming fresh burgers, complete with grilled, caramelized onions, pickles, lettuce, ketchup, mustard, and some kind of steak sauce, and a large pitcher of cola to wash it all down.  Ed's eyes were practically bulging out of his head when he saw the sheer size of each burger set before him, and looked down at his own bloated stomach uncertainly.  Even the crowd around him was muttering amongst themselves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little more than bewildered himself, Al nonetheless stepped forward and said, \"Ed!  Remember all the times Granny Pinako would make burgers for us?  You used to eat at least a dozen each and every time!\"  Al sweat dropped and added, \"And whenever Winry and I couldn't finish, you'd jump right in and finish ours too\u2026\"  Ed thought for a moment, and started snickering, remembering how he'd even go as far as snatch burgers from them when they weren't looking.  Then a spectator amidst the crowd said, \"You kidding me?!  There's no WAY that little shrimp can eat all those burgers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Ed perched up from his seat, waving his arms up angrily as he shouted \"WHO ARE YOU CALLING A LITTLE SHRIMP?!!!\"  Gritting his teeth, he grabbed a burger and said, \"Ya think a shrimp can do THIS?!\"  He then opened his mouth as wide as he could and took a big, honking bite of his first burger.  He chewed vigorously angrily for a moment, then stopped as his eyes widened.  Suddenly, the angry expression on his face became one of bewilderment.  \"Wow\u2026these things taste INCREDIBLE!\" Ed said with newfound excitement as he turned to his burger and took another bite, and another, and another.  Before he knew it, the first burger had been completely inhaled in a matter of moments.  Licking his nonmetallic fingers clean, Ed licked his lips, and grabbed his second burger, wasting no time, getting to work on his next burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl and the others watched in amazement as the young alchemist proceeded to wolf down the burgers like he'd not eaten in days.  Which was especially surprising considering how large his belly had already grown, and continued to grow with each few passing bites gulped down.  It had gotten to the point where his shirt just barely stood right on his belly button.  Finally, after successfully finishing his next burger, Ed sighed with relief and then took a swig of his drink and burped loudly, patting his belly proudly, before moving onto the next burger.  Al continued to watch and cheer his brother on.  \"Come on, I know you can do this!\"  Others cheered on and watched as Ed continued to put away the burgers one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time rolls on...</span></div></div>",

And of course, which each burger downed, his swollen stomach continued to expand further and further, to the point where his belly button had long been exposed, and the shirt had now risen a good inch above it now.  However, by the time Ed had reached his sixth burger, it began to catch up with him.  Before taking that first, whopping bite, he stopped and winced, lowering the burger as he clutched his bloated belly firmly with his free hand, as he began to groan in discomfort, much to Al's dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother?  Are you feeling alright?\" Al asked from afar.  Ed opened his mouth to respond, but instead, accidentally let out a long, queasy belch.  \"*UUUUURRP!*  Ugh...<u>that's</u> how I'm feeling right now...\" replied Ed groggily as he began to rub his belly, hoping to coax away the sudden fullness ailing him.  \"My stomach feels kinda tight now...man, what I wouldn't give to be able to transmute one of these burgers into an alka seltzer,\" Ed said to himself, whilst massaging his midsection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rubbed his gut, he felt an uncomfortable tightness around the front of his waistline.  His stomach had grown so much that it began to press firmly into the front of his pants, causing his abdomen's current distress.  Wasting no time, the young alchemist reached as best he could for the front of his pants, trying to unbutton it and free his belly from its' current restraints, but it was so swollen that it was practically impossible for Ed to reach by himself.  Groaning in fullness and annoyance, he turned to Al and said, \"Hey, Al!  Can you help me with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ummm, s-sure!\" Al responded, stepping from the crowd.  But before he could approach Ed, one of the attendants to the contest stopped him and said, \"I'm sorry, young man, but the rules stipulate that no contestant may receive any outside help of any kind.\"  Al glanced at Ed still reaching for his button and replied, \"But sir, his tummy is stuck and I need to-\" but before he continue, the man held his hand forward and said, \"Rules are rules.  I'm sorry.\"  Al glanced back at Ed who looked back at him and smirked assuredly.  \"Don't worry, Al.   I'll figure something out,\" Ed replied, giving Al a thumbs up before turning back to his burgers.  Al glanced at him with concern, but nonetheless, returned with the crowd.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...what to do...what to do...\" Ed said to himself.  \"I'm never gonna finish these things if my gut's still caught by my button.  And it's so big that I can't even reach the damn thing.  Rgh, if only Winry could ever figure out how to get the extendable wrist thing working...\"  Ed continued to muse and ponder, until suddenly, it hit him.  \"Heeeey, yeah, that outta work!  I'll just keep eating until my stomach gets big enough to break through the button itself!\"  He grabbed the burger, but grimaced, as his stomach was still too uncomfortably tight to eat.  But he mustered enough strength to take as big a bite as he possibly could, much to everyone's surprise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was chewing a lot slower before gulping down a big, heaping mouthful of his burger, causing him to wince as the pain in his belly worsened.  Nonetheless, he soldiered on.  Taking one bite after another, each one causing his gut more discomfort than the last.  He could feel his gut pressing more and more into the button of his pants, causing it to tether slightly, but maintain itself, even after Ed had finished his sixth burger.  \"Stubborn bastard, aren'tcha...\" cursed Ed to his button, \"...but so am I!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point on, Ed proceeded to...</span></div></div>",

But if I can't eat until I do, then how...</i> His thoughts trailed off as his eyes fell upon the rather large pitcher of cola. He grinned mischievously. <i>Bingo.</i> Licking his lips, Ed seized the pitcher, brought it to his mouth, and tilted it up, letting the sweet, fizzy liquid flow into his mouth. Al's fiery eyes widened, before he sighed and facepalmed for the umpteenth time that day. <i>Ooooof course he'd do that...</i> he thought to himself, shaking his head. Which one of them was supposed to be the older brother, again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to Al's thoughts, Ed chugged away, ignoring the tiny rivulets of cola that flowed down his cheeks. His stomach gurgled as it slowly expanded, to the varied awe and disgust of the spectators. One in particular was especially interested in the spectacle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis individual, oddly enough, was the very same one that had heckled Ed earlier and called him a \"shrimp\", though not out of any spite; indeed, those who knew him would attest that he hardly had a mean bone in his body. No, that had been more of a motivator, so to speak; after all, the young alchemist's temper was almost legendary, and what better way to motivate him than by riling him up? And, as a result, both he and the crowd were being treated to quite a spectacle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shifted uncomfortably where he stood. <i>Actually makes all this discomfort worth it...</i> he thought, wincing. Although it was a pleasantly warm Spring day, the individual was clad in a heavy hooded sweatshirt, the hood drawn far over his head and his face tilting downward, all but concealing it from sight. In addition, he wore a pair of mittens over his hands, though these were hidden from sight inside his jean pockets. He wore heavy boots over his feet, a rare occurrence for him (and rather uncomfortable, he might add), as well as an odd bulge in the back of his pants...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. <i>Just take it easy; this is all gonna be worth it. Then you can change into something WAY more comfortable...</i> Shaking his head, he refocused his attention on the determined young alchemist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd continued chugging away, slowly but surely inflating his already-engorged belly and slowly forcing his shirt higher. More importantly, though, it continued its push against his waistline, putting more and more strain on both his pants button and his belt buckle, the latter of which had begun quivering. Sensing this, Ed grinned savagely and began chugging even faster than before, swelling his stomach out even more and further increasing the strain on his pants. Behind his buckle, the button to his pants was slowly beginning to loosen, the threads holding it on unraveling one by one. The belt buckle itself began quivering rather violently, the belt's leather beginning to rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grrr....</i> Ed thought to himself, chugging and chugging even as the pain in his waistline became almost unbearable. <i>Come...on...</i> More rips appeared, more button threads loosened, and the buckle continued quivering even more violently, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRRRRIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd gasped as the metallic buckle burst off his pants, shooting straight over the table and impacting the opposite wall, very narrowly missing the heads of one of the patrons. A shocked murmur went up through the audience, while Al simply groaned quietly. \"Really, brother?\" He muttered to himself. \"You couldn't have undone your belt <i>before</i> you got to this point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's pants, however, weren't done just yet; the release of the belt had allowed his stomach to surge forward a bit more, and because of all the pressure, all the remaining threads of his pants button came loose rather violently, causing the plastic disc to burst off his waistline with an audible \"POP!\" and follow the same trajectory as his belt buckle and sailing in an arc over the table, once again impacting the wall and narrowly missing a patron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young alchemist released a massive sigh, slumping back in his chair and letting his one arm hang limply to the side while the other massaged his even more swollen belly, now a good several inches above his navel. In addition, the loss of his belt buckle (the straps of which remained on his waist but now curved horizontally over his swollen belly) and his button had caused his fly to go down a few teeth. \"Oh man, that felt so GOOD,,,\" He let out a loud burp, sighing happily and licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl shook his head reprovingly. \"Brother, I swear, sometimes you're so crude...\" Ed's only response was to turn to Al and grin widely, before straightening up, grabbing his seventh burger, and getting to work on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hooded watcher observed all of this, a massive grin on his concealed face and the bulge in the back of his jeans struggling to move. <i>Excellent work, Mr. Elric,</i> he thought approvingly as Ed began savaging his burger. <i>Now, go get 'em!</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just three more burgers to go!\" cheered young Alphonse as Ed finally gulped down the last heaping mouthful of the seventh burger into his already immensely bloated gut.  After gulping it down, Ed sighed with relief and rested his hand atop his gut, rubbing it gingerly from an overwhelming fullness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, my stomach feels like it's about to burst...\" Ed said to himself, trying to massage the pain away to little avail, despite having just busted a belt buckle and a button just to free it from its' restraints.  The hooded spectator watched in amusement as Ed's belly swelled out further as a result of polishing off seven burgers straight.  Of course; all that soda and strained eating HAD to have been trying for the young man as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed it had been.  As shortly after finishing his seventh burger, Ed's ridiculously swollen stomach began to quiver and gurgle rather audibly once more, causing the young alchemist to wince and clutch around the middle of his belly firmly with one hand, whilst the other hand; once hanging limp from his chair, was now covering his mouth.  Al stepped forward, glancing with concern and cautiousness.  \"Ed?  A-are you alright?!\"  His younger brother asked, concerned that the contents in which his older brother had just consumed was going to reappear again, as were some other weary spectators.  The spectator in the hooded sweatshirt, on the other hand, merely smirked to himself and shook his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Heeere it comes...</i> he thought to himself, before Ed removed his hand from his mouth and let out a tremendously loud belch which lasted a few seconds straight, shocking and disgusting many of the spectators around them, whilst earning a chuckle from the hooded observer.  <i>Sheesh, and I thought Uzumaki had bad manners...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rgh, wait, there's more...\" said Ed, before pressing his belly and forcing up an even louder and longer belch almost immediately after the last.  When it was finally over, Ed leaned back in his chair and smacked his lips.  \"Ahhhhhh, MUCH better!\" replied Ed, patting his belly proudly, and inadvertently forcing a much lighter burp free as a result.  He then proceeded to massage his still rather aching gut carelessly while the others were still recovering from the surprise eruption.  Meanwhile, Al began to shake his metallic helmet of a head as he sighed to himself \"Honestly, Ed...\" said Al, half embarrassed, and half still in shock, \"...you can be a real pig sometimes.\" to which Ed scoffed and replied, \"Well, I'm sorry, but if YOU had a stomach full of pork chops, giant burgers, and a ton of soda, you'd probably be burping your ass off too!  Besides, what's more important?  Having good manners in an eating contest?  Or having enough room in your gut to WIN said eating contest?  Hmmm?\"  Ed raised an eyebrow and smirked when Al couldn't respond.  \"That's what I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, something else caught the hooded spectators watchful but concealed eyes.  He noticed that from all the sudden bursting of clothing and gastric discomfort, Ed's navel had begun to tense up abnormally, which caused him to smirk as he was fully aware of what that meant was going to happen very soon.  <i>Hehe, excellent...</i> he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl shook his head and asked, \"Well, do you at least have enough room to continue now?\"  To which Ed grinned mischievously and said, \"Hehe, I dunno.  I think I can push out one last big one before I finish the burgers...best play it safe and finish with as much room as possible, right?\"  Al rolled his fiery eyes and shrugged as Ed took a deep breath and pressed against his gut....only nothing happened.  He scowled disappointed and said, \"Ah crap...guess not.\"  Though it was mostly for show, there was still a bit of excess pressure causing him some discomfort which needed to be expelled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, he still had about half a pitcher of soda left, and immediately figured, if it helped free up some room last time, no reason it wouldn't now.  But as he reached for it, Al interjected with, \"Don't overdo it, Ed!  You already look like you're practically pregnant!  If you overdo it before you can even finish those burgers, you're going to make yourself sick!\"  Hearing these words, Ed glanced down at his immensely swollen tummy and considered the notion.  As it stood, he couldn't recall the last time his belly was ever this immensely swollen before, and maybe it would be best not to add more to that when he still had three more burgers to go.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever; knowing that downing the rest of the soda would help Ed free up enough room to finish the burgers, as well as bust another appendage adding some unneeded pressure to the elder Elric, the hooded spectator decided to give Ed a boost by egging the short tempered alchemist on further.  He cleared his throat and masked his voice as he called out from the crowd and said, \"Awww, what's wrong?  Is the pipsqueak's tummy too itty bitty for a little more soda?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, despite all discomfort, Ed's temper got the better of him as he immediately hopped on top of his chair and flailed his arms in the air angrily as he shouted, \"PIPSQUEEEEAK?!!!!!  ITTY-BITTYYYYYYY?!?!?!?!!!  GGAAAAHHHH!!!  WHY DON'TCHA COME UP HERE AND SAY THAT TO THIS ITTY BITTY PIPSQUEAK'S FACE!!!!!!!!!!\"  As Ed's furious rambling continued, the hooded spectator couldn't help but snicker to himself at the overly animated display.  Though he didn't really mean his insulting remarks, he knew it'd be the motivator Ed needed to push himself further....the fact that it was absolutely hilarious to watch was just an added plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rgh!  Itty-bitty-pipsqueak...!\" Ed continued grumbling angrily to himself as he snatched the pitcher and looked furiously at the unseen crowd member heckling him.  \"Could an itty-bitty-pipsqueak do THIS?!\"  Without hesitation, he proceeded to scornfully chug down ther emaining contents of his soda pitcher in an effort to free up the last bit of pent up pressure ailing him.  While Ed was busy chugging away, Al was glancing curiously at the crowd of spectators around him.  <i>That kind of sounded like the same person from before...why would someone be trying to heckle Ed like that...?</i> Al thought to himself as he looked amidst the crowd of people, hoping to match a face to the voice, but to no avail, was unable to find the culprit in question.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill suspicious, Al nonetheless turned his attention back to Ed, whose belly was continuing to swell further.  As he watched though, he couldn't help but shift his attention to a strange occurrence from Ed's belly.  His belly button seemed to be shifting and vibrating unusually as he relentlessly chugged more and more soda out of spite.  <i>...Please don't make yourself sick, big brother...</i> Al thought, still concerned for his older brothers well being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as Ed continued to chug the remaining contents of his soda pitcher...</span></div></div>",

The hooded spectator smirked. <i>Heh; Check. And. Mate.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering the now nearly-depleted pitcher, Ed belched, slammed it down on the table, and leaned back. \"Oh man, that felt sooooo good...\" He closed his eyes and sighed, mentally preparing himself for Al's inevitable scolding at his lack of manners. When nothing was fortchoming, Ed opened his eyes and looked up at his little brother. His fiery eyes were wide, his metallic face staring directly at his belly. \"Uh, Al? What's wrong?\" Instead of answering, the younger Elric simply raised his arm and pointed at his distended navel. Ed followed it, his eyes widening as he beheld his popped-out belly button. \"...huh. That's new.\" Experimentally, he raised his non-metallic arm and prodded the small protrusion, a slightly goofy smile appearing on his face as he did so. \"Heh, that feels sorta funny...\" Al groaned and shook his head; he loved Ed dearly, but sometimes he could be so immature...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spectator, on the other hand, chuckled to himself. <i>Ah, it's always fun to watch them do that.</i> Making sure no one was looking, he slipped one mitten off, slipped the uncovered hand up to the top of his head beneath his hood, and scratched a spot on his head that had been bothering him. \"Oooh, yeah...that feels nice...heh heh...\" Once it was scratched to his satisfaction, he retracted his hand (being careful to tug his hood further over his head), slipped the mitten back on, and got back to watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his delight, Ed had tired of playing with his belly button, and had now started on the last of the three burgers. <i>Oooooh yes...got your second wind, don't give up now...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to him, his impromptu scratching session had drawn Al's attention, who was now glancing suspiciously in his direction. Now he was sure of it: the strange noises had been coming from the spectator wearing a hooded sweatshirt, jeans, and mittens...on a Spring day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl's eyes focused on him for a second, before turning his attention back to Ed to make sure he didn't make himself sick.

The quick paced eating caused his still slightly but steadily increasing gut to jiggle and vibrate, which; in turn, caused his now inverted belly button to wobble around comically as the young man continued to hungrily stuff his face.  Some spectators stared in awe, others; disgust, and some, even amusement, as a few began to cheer for the kid to keep up his momentum.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Al's shifted focus remained on only one particular spectator; the overly hooded individual who Al was certain was the culprit heckling his older brother.  [i]I wonder what that guy's deal is\u2026[/i] Al thought to himself as he examined the individual in question.  [i]Why's he picking on brother?  And why the heck is he dressed like he just stepped out of an igloo\u2026?

And so he continued to chomp away.  Finishing his eighth burger with ease and spite, and moving onto burger number nine.  All the while, as the burgers' size grew smaller and smaller; little by little, Ed's stomach grew larger and and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally, Ed would stop to catch his breath momentarily, but jumped right back to more of the remaining burgers, until he'd successfully polished off all ten burgers with eventual gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back in his chair, Ed burped loudly and patted his belly victoriously.  \"Ahhh, FINALLY!\" Ed exclaimed with pride, before grumbling to himself, \"Hmph!  Bet an itty-bitty-pipsqueak couldn't polish off those burgers\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter smiled and took the plate from Ed's table.  \"Nicely done, young man.

Just about in the-errr\u2026w-wait, whadduya mean \"just about\" in the bag?\"  Ed glanced at the waiter quizzically as he stepped aside and smirked at the young alchemist, and said, \"Come on, kid.  What kind of competition ends after just two rounds?\"  Ed gaped and said, \"Ummm\u2026the kind with a bunch of pork chops in one round, and ten giant burgers in the next, perhaps\u2026?\"  The waiter smiled as another stepped towards Ed, causing the young man's jaw to drop.  \"And what better way to close our escapades off than with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven some spectators murmured to themselves at Ed's final venture standing between him and victory.  The spectator in question smirked to himself.  [i]Well\u2026THIS should be interesting\u2026[/i]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's final challenge was none other than\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shortly after revealing that there was one course left to go, the waiters had brought what was, quite possibly, the largest jug of milk any of them had ever seen; it had to be at least several gallons of what appeared to be whole milk, and the table was even beginning to creak a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milk,\" Ed muttered in a tiny voice. \"Out of all the things in the world, it had to be MILK...\" The hooded spectator fought harder than ever to restrain his laughter; thanks to his contacts, he was well aware that the young alchemist loathed milk; he'd hated it his entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl, obviously aware of this, tried to lighten the mood a bit. \"W-well, brother, you know Granny, Winry, and me worry about you not getting enough calcium in your diet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd slowly turned his head toward Al. \"It's MILK, Alphonse,\" the boy replied, deadpan. \"It is a disgusting liquid secreted by a COW.\" He turned back to the massive jug on the table. \"Oh man, why did it have to be milk...?\" Al, seeing his attempt at lightening his brother's mood fail, simply sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spectator smirked underneath his hood. <i>Giving up already? I think not.</i> He frowned; how to go about 'encouraging' Ed, though? He could insult his height again, but considering Ed's complete and utter hatred of the beverage, he wasn't sure how far that would take him. \"Hmmm,\" the spectator muttered to himself, folding his arms (and taking care to conceal as much of his mittens as he could). <i>What to do?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought for a few seconds; luckily, it wasn't long before an idea came to him. <i>Hmm...that might work.</i> Smirking, he decided to....</span></div></div>",

But if ANYONE'S tough enough to drink it all, it's you!\"  Ed faced the frighteningly tall jug of milk while Al kept his focus on the crowd.  He glanced for the hooded spectator, and sure enough, he spotted him hiding amongst the crowd as he proceeded to start a chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Full-Metal!  Full-Metal!\"  The hooded stranger started.  Sure enough, other members of the audience proceeded to join in, chanting for Ed to go all the way.  <i>It's the same guy!</i>  Al thought to himself.  <i>Why would he go from taunting and being mean to Ed, to cheering him on...?</i>  He knew he'd have to get to the bottom of this.

Bro-ther!  Bro-ther!\"  Looking around, and seeing that everyone believed he was tough enough to finish this, Ed glared with certainty at the milk.  <i>They're right!

If I can lay the hurt on psychotic homunculus, renegade alchemists, and tolerate Mustang's big mouth for more than six seconds, then I can handle a little bit of m-</i> his thought halted mid-sentence, remembering the beast he was now up against.  He then glanced down at his own immensely bloated stomach as it began to gurgle in protest, causing him to wince slightly as he clutched his stomach briefly in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nevertheless, Ed shook it off, and kept his determinations high.  \"No, I can do this!  And I WILL!\" he said to himself with certainty as he grabbed the jug and hoisted it off the table, catching everyone's attention.  He glared angrily at the jug of milk and said, \"Milk!  You're going down!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of stillness passed, as Ed began to sweat nervously, despite the fierceness in his face.  Finally, the young alchemist took the jug and slowly forced it to his lips.  Al and the crowd gasped as Ed tilted the jug up, and began to take big hearty gulps of his least favorite substance on the planet.  The spectator smirked to himself as the strange bulge from the back of his pants began shifting left and right before he halted it and grinned beneath his hood.  <i>I knew that would work.

Al merely looked down at him in concern<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spectator, on the other hand, raised an eyebrow. <i>Hmm, looks as though Ed's starting to flag...</i> He grinned mischievously under his hood. <i>Well, I know how to rectify that...</i> Doing his best to mask his voice, he called out, \"Oh, c'mon!

Can't wait to see where this leads...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd, equally intrigued, watched with rapt attention as Ed slammed his hands on the sides of the jug, lighting up the room with the crackling energy of an alchemical transmutation, causing some of the crowd to shield their eyes. Within a few seconds, the light died down, revealing that the jug had been changed, though the vile liquid inside remained the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd fell silent as they gaped at what the container had been transformed into. The hooded spectator grinned widely, the bulge in the back of his jeans moving back and forth. <i>Oh ho ho ho, this is gonna be EPIC....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl simply stared at the new object on the table. \"Brother...is that what I think it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd nodded, grinning. \"Yep, sure is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe object, in question, was a metallic funnel that had been created from the glass jug. It appeared to be a normal jug, save that it had a small catch towards the bottom that kept the milk from leaking out. Once the catch was undone, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning widely, Ed hefted the milk-filled funnel up to his mouth, placed the tip in his mouth, and flipped the catch. Almost immediately, thick, creamy milk began pouring down the funnel into his waiting gullet. Ed almost gagged, but managed to avoid spluttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl's eye twitched a bit. \"Brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd threw an apologetic look Al's way, but nonetheless kept the funnel where it was, pouring milk into his gargantuan but still-growing tummy. The crowd watched, flabbergasted, as the young alchemist's already-overpacked midsection continued to inflate, almost like a water balloon being filled. His fly, already forced all the way down (and exposing his light-blue boxers in the process,) began to strain as his stomach grew bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spectator chuckled silently, even as the bulge in the back of his pants began wagging even faster. <i>Well, Mr. Elric, it appears as though you've persevered...</i> He smirked. <i>Excellent job, sir; excellent job...</i></span></div></div>",

More notably, few people were able to take their eyes off of the young alchemists unnaturally distended belly as it inflated to obscene amounts, pressing outward like a water balloon that should have burst a long time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hooded spectator grinned as he watched Ed; despite a strained and disgusted look on his face, chug relentlessly.  <i>Goodness, he's drinking more milk in one sitting than most people do all year round.

Ed's tummy had distended so far past his pants zippers limit, that the fabric began to tear ever so slightly as Ed chugged on and on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ed leaned back and began to pull the funnel upwards from his mouth as the final rush of milk visibly rushed from the bottom catch of the funnel and down into Ed's reluctant but awaiting mouth.  A few more drops followed, then a few more, then, nothing.  Weary, Ed held the funnel outward to show that it was now bone dry, and dropped it with a hearty THUD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....He...he actually did it...\" Al said with amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence passed as Ed groggily sat in his chair, both hands rested atop his amazingly distended stomach, groaning slightly.  \"Brother...?  A-are you okay...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer Al's question, Ed's mouth flung open as he let out the loudest and queasiest-sounding belch anyone in the audience had ever heard.  The sudden eruption carried enough force to cause his belly to vibrate and jostle, and sure enough, the sudden motion had pushed a further strain on the front of his pants, until finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RRRRIIIIIIIIIIIP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...If Al still had a face to blush, it would be redder than seven hundred roses as the front of Ed's pants finally gave and tore wide open, exposing his light blue boxers and causing his belly to distend outward, free from any restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hooded spectator started visibly jerking himself as he fought the urge not to bust out laughing hysterically.  <i>Ohhhh my, I KNEW this would be epic...</i> he thought as he continued to force back his amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over, Ed leaned back against his chair, utterly dazed as a weary smile grew over his face.  Instead of laugh or be mortified, the crowd stood in yet another moment of silence, then erupted into a cheer of congratulations for the young alchemist finally beating the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo dazed to fully hear the applause he was receiving, Ed simply muttered \"...So...much...milk...\" to himself as he continued to massage his immensely swollen gut.  Shaking his head, Al nonetheless chuckled to himself and said, \"You goof...\" then approached his brother.  \"Need a hand, brother?\" he asked.  Ed belched then nodded weakly.  Al offered his hand and was about to help his brother up, when he glanced down and remembered something.  \"Err....brother...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever dazed, Ed glanced curiously and looked down, almost immediately blushing with embarrassment as he saw his pants had ripped.  \"...I was wondering what that sound was...\"  With one hand clutching his pants for dear life, he took Al's hand with the other, as Al gently hoisted his brother up to his feet.  Ed took his free hand and held up his swollen tummy as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant then approached Ed, applauding softly himself.  \"Well done, young man!  Seems you've got the appetite of a champion afterall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd groaned and said, \"...Milk--*BURP*--is not the drink of champions...\"  The attendant simply laughed and said, \"Don't be so sure.\"  He then held out a Golden Trophy Bowl.  Inside it, several wads of cash.  Both Ed and Al's eyes lit up at the sight.  \"....Soooo much money...\" Ed muttered, almost forgetting how full he was for a split second, before reaching towards the Trophy and wincing, immediately clutching his stomach for support once again.  \"Heh...eh, Al?  You mind?\"  Still bewildered, Al shook his head and accepted the prize on Ed's behalf.  The attendant smiled and said, \"Let's hear it one more time for him, folks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd applauded once again as Ed, a bit more present this time, smiled wearily, still clutching his pants for dear life as he leaned towards Al and said, \"Let's get the hell outta here before my pants bust even more...or my auto-mail leg does trying to hold me up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted, Ed looked up and saw Al glancing curiously at the crowd, unable to find the hooded heckler.  \"Al?  Did you hear what I said?\"  As if snapped out of his trance, Al looked down and nodded, then the two took their leave from the scene.  The spectator in the hood watched still hiding from within the crowd, then proceeded to take off as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Al and Ed walked onward, with Ed still clutching his pants and stomach for dear life, occasionally groaning and burping from all the discomfort the prolonged movement was causing his distressed tummy.  \"I still can't believe you actually drank all that milk,\" Al noted, before chuckling and adding, \"Winry would be so proud.\"  Ed grunted to himself and said, \"Pffft, I almost wish she WAS there.  I'd have taken her tossing wrenches over my head for not wanting to drink the milk than that jackass who kept giving me crap the whole time.\"  Al nodded and said, \"Yeah, he sure was obnoxious...but...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd glanced curiously at Al.  \"But?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But believe it or not, at one point, he got people cheering for you too, when it looked like you were getting ready to call it quits with the milk.\"  Ed raised an eyebrow, and said, \"Wait, you SAW this jerk?  Why didn't ya tell me?  We could'a kicked his ass after the-\"  Before Ed could continue, his stomach gurgled loudly, causing him to wince and reel back again.  \"...Oof...fair point...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl shrugged and said, \"It was really weird.  One second he was heckling you, the next, cheering, then heckling again!  And I didn't even tell you the weirdest part.  He was dressed like he'd just walked through a blizzard.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In THIS weather...?\" Ed asked.  Al nodded.  \"From head to toe.  Honestly, if I didn't know better, I'd say he was trying to disguise himself.\"  Ed glanced curiously and said, \"Unless he's from central or some kinda big shot, what would it matter if people saw him?\"  Ed stopped and asked, \"...You think he was a fugitive?\"  Al shook his head and said, \"Why would a fugitive risk getting caught just to watch you stuff your face?\"  Ed scowled slightly, but eased up and said, \"Ehhh, fair point...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to them however, was that the individual in question was trailing just out of their sights behind them, until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ed and Al continued soldiering on, the latter sighing as Ed staggered along, supporting his weight on his younger brother. The young, overstuffed alchemist groaned as they walked, holding his busted pants with hand and supporting himself on Al's arm with the other. \"Oh geez, Al; my stomach's really hurting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl rolled his fiery eyes. \"Well, I'm sorry, brother, but it WAS your decision to stuff yourself at that eating competition.\" He looked down at his big brother's ridiculously swollen, distended midsection, inverted navel wobbling with the slightest movement. \"Seriously, I've never seen someone's stomach get THAT big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of his discomfort, Ed grinned at his brother. \"Heh; ya think maybe I set some kinda record?\" He belched, groaning a bit, before continuing. \"Actually, even though I'm kinda feeling sick now, it was kinda fun just stuffing myself...\" his grin turned mischievous. \"Who knows? Maybe you can try it once we get you your body back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl laughed nervously. \"Uh, thanks, but I think I'll pass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Clack.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl's eyes went wide. \"Brother, did you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd, in spite of his immense discomfort, nodded. \"Yeah, I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome distance behind them, the spectator cursed as the sizable pebble he'd accidentally kicked bounced off the street a couple times. <i>Damn it! How did I not see that?</i> He took a breath. <i>Alright, calm down; just duck behind an alleyway, let 'em look this way for a second, and everything'll be...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts trailed off as both Elric brothers turned their heads behind them, their eyes narrowing as they caught sight of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aw, crapbaskets.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd scowled. \"That... that jackass was actually <i>following</i> us?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl said nothing for a second. Then... \"Brother, could you support your weight on my leg for a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Ed nonetheless complied. \"Uh, sure Al, but what...\" His eyes lit up as Al clapped his armored hands together. \"...ah, I got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spectator's eyes widened under his hood. <i>H-he's transmuting?</i> Almost to confirm this fact, Al slammed his hands down on the street. Realizing he'd already wasted too much time, he backed away, intending to run...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...only for the ground beneath him to warp, rising up and wrapping around his legs. <i>Crap!</i> he thought, struggling. <i>Crapcrapcrapcrap!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd looked up at his older brother, undeniable pride in his eyes. \"Wow...nice one, Al.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl chuckled. \"Thanks, Ed; been working on that one for a bit.\" His eyes moved towards the caught stranger, and his tone turned serious. \"Now, let's see what this is all about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd cackled, an undeniably wicked gleam in his eyes. \"And then I can show that jerk what happens when you insult the Fullmetal Alchemist...\" Al sighed, but otherwise said nothing. Together, they loped toward the stranger, who, upon seeing this, struggled even harder, but it was no good; his legs were stuck fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the stranger, Ed wasted no time berating him, even as he marveled at his unseasonably thick clothing. \"Alright, you bastard, talk! Who the hell are you, why were you calling me pipsqueak,\" his eye twitched slightly at this, \"and why the HELL were you following us?!\" The stranger merely stood still, more than a little terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl put a calming hand on Ed's shoulder. \"Ed, take it easy.\" He turned his attention towards the stranger. When he spoke, it was in a calm, but very stern tone; Ed noted it to be not unlike the one he used with him whenever he was scolding him. \"Who are you?\" Upon seeing the stranger still frightened, he softened his tone the slightest bit. \"Relax, we're not gonna hurt you...\" Ed gaped at Al, shocked, but the animated armor disregarded this. \"...we just wanna know who you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, thankfully, seemed to calm the hooded stranger a bit. \"W-well,\" he stammered, still composing himself, \"before I introduce myself, it might be best if I take the mittens and hood off first.\" He gulped. \"Just, uh, promise me you won't freak out, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd scowled. \"You don't <i>get</i> to make demands, jerk...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ed!\" Al exclaimed, giving his brother his best reproachful look (a somewhat difficult task when one's face was made of immovable metal.) Nonetheless, Ed seemed to get the message, and settled back into a sulky silence. \"We promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir prisoner nodded. \"Alright...\" Holding up both of his hands, he grabbed one of his mittens and tugged it right off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd and Al's eyes widened. \"Wh-what the hell...\" the stuffed Alchemist muttered, staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger's hand was very odd, to say the least. Specifically, it was covered in brown fur, blunt nails like a dog's jutting out from each finger. As he brought the newly-uncovered hand to pull off his other mitten, the brothers noted that he also had canine-like pads on the underside of his hand; one large one on his palm, five small ones on each of his fingers. Upon pulling off the other mitten, they saw it was the same as the other one. Then, bringing his hands (or were they hand-like paws?) up to his hood, he gripped it and threw it back, exposing his face and head in its entirety. Upon catching sight of it, Al's eyes got even wider, while Ed's mouth dropped open a bit. The stranger, seeing their reactions, laughed a bit nervously. \"Uh, hi; how ya doin'?\" Ed and Al didn't reply; they were too busy staring at what had been revealed: specifically, a long, lupine muzzle and nose, pointed ears at the top of his head, and, oddly enough, a pair of glasses perched upon the bridge of his muzzle that covered a pair of hazel eyes. His head, like his hands, was covered in brown fur. In addition, he had a messy crop of fur at the top of his head, of a slightly different shade of brown than the rest of his body, giving it the appearance of hair. He appeared to be, quite simply, a bipedal wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl found his voice first. \"You're...you're a wolf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange wolf-person laughed, this time a bit more easily. \"An anthropomorphic wolf to be exact, but yeah.\" His lupine face suddenly contorted in discomfort. \"Which reminds me...\" Reaching behind him, he reached into the back of his jeans, rooting around a bit. \"Let's see...ah!\" Grinning triumphantly, he grabbed something and pulled it out, revealing it to be a long, bushy tail. \"Ahhh, that's better...\" he sighed, releasing it and letting it wag about happily. \"I swear, it felt like my tail was jammed up my ass.\" He turned back to the brothers, looking a great deal more at ease. \"Alright, now introductions.\" He grinned widely, extending a paw/hand. \"The name's Hunter; I'd ask you for your names, but your reputations precede you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Al nonetheless extended his hand, but was stopped by Ed. \"Al, what the hell are you doing? This guy was heckling me and stalking both of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl looked at Ed a bit reprovingly, but held his hand where it was. \"Yeah, we wanted to ask; why were you making fun of Brother at the contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blinked. \"Oh, that?\" He laughed a bit nervously, scratching the back of his head. \"Well, it's no secret Ed's a little...sensitive, about his height...\" this earned an infuriated glare from the young State Alchemist. \"...so I thought calling him pipsqueak would help motivate him to keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl couldn't help but chuckle a bit at this. \"Well, you thought right...\" A thought occured to him, and the stern tone returned. \"I still have to ask, though: why did you dress up like that just to see Brother stuff his...\" He gasped. \"You...you were making sure he stuffed himself so you could eat him, didn't you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?!\" Hunter exclaimed, jerking in surprise and causing his glasses to slip down his muzzle a bit. Pushing them back up, he continued, \"N-no! I just like watching guys like Ed stuff themselves and make fools of themselves!\" He grumbled, folding his arms. \"Seriously, why does everyone always think I'm gonna eat them?\" He saw Ed opening his mouth, but interjected. \"Also, I was following you so I could see your gut bouncing and jiggling as you walked; looked pretty damn funny.\" Ed blushed wildly and looked away. \"And, uh...once you've digested a good bit, I figured I could treat you some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd blinked. \"Treat? You mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl stared at the anthro. \"Brother just got done stuffing himself, and you wanted to encourage him to do it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded. \"Eeyep; even found an abandoned warehouse to set up shop in; it's got some really comfy mattresses Ed can sleep everything off on, plus I've brought and prepared a ton of food for ya.\" He chuckled. \"Who knows, we might even get to know each other a little better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd, in spite of himself, considered this: as much as he still wanted to pummel this freak for making fun of him, he WAS tired, and the hotel was a ways away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing his pride, Ed asked, \"Is it far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother!\" Al exclaimed, looking at Ed in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled a bit. \"Nope; it's just a block or two down.\" He winced a bit. \"I'll show you the way, but would you mind...?\" He gestured to his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl followed the gesture. \"Oh yeah; sorry!\" Clapping his hands together, he placed them on Hunter's bindings, causing the restraints to sink back into the street to reveal his booted feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sighed. \"Thanks. Now...\" Reaching down, he unlaced the boots and kicked them off, revealing a pair of elongated, lupine feet, the back of the foot sticking up in the air. Now that the brothers looked closer, they could see that Hunter had a digitigrade stance. \"Phew, glad those are off; my feet like friggin' ovens.\" He turned around. \"Now, then, let's head to the warehouse. The sooner we get there, the sooner Ed can start sleeping the food off...\" he tugged at the collar of his sweatshirt. \"...and the sooner I can change into something a bit more comfortable.\" Gesturing for the two to follow, he began heading off. Ed and Al, though reluctant, nodded at each other and followed him.</span></div></div>",

His massive exposed belly still jostling and bouncing with each step they took.  Neither one took their eyes off Hunter as they spoke amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So, a walking, talking, wolf...\" Al said, scratching the back of his metallic head.  Ed grumbled and added, \"More like trash-talking.  'It's no secret that Ed's sensitive about his height...'  I wonder how sensitive his face would be after I punched it into oblivion...\"  Al rolled his fiery eyes and looked down at Ed.  \"Are you still mad about that, Brother?  He DID say he was only doing it to motivate you.  And that motivation DID help you win quite a bit of cash.\"  Ed grumbled and said, \"You're just defending him cause you thought it was funny too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Al snickered a bit and shrugged.  \"Guess you got me there.\"  He then turned his attention back on Hunter and asked, \"Still...a walking, talking wolf...\"  Ed turned back to Hunter and noted, \"Yeah, I wonder what his story is too.  Think he could be a Chimera?\"  Al scratched his metallic head and said, \"I suppose it's possible.  He's definitely eccentric, but he seems to advanced, too comprehensive to be someones experiment.  Plus how many Chimeras get a kick out of watching people stuff themselves and make fools of themselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd immediately scowled and said, \"Hey!  We were strapped for cash, and I got us some!  That's called being responsible, you dope!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to them, Hunter could hear everything they were saying and couldn't help but snicker a bit at their constant back and forth bantering.  <i>Heh, almost reminds me of watching Naruto and Kiba go back and forth....cept neither of them are anywhere near as bone-headed as Naruto...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining his composure, Al spoke a bit more seriously and whispered, \"Still, setting up shop at an abandoned warehouse is pretty suspicious.  We can't rule out the possibility that this is an ambush and that they're luring us in because you're too full to fight back.\"  Ed nodded and said, \"It's not like I can't perform a transmutation on a full stomach, Al.  So if we ARE walking into an ambush, we can take whatever he or his masters can dish out.  And then I'll finally have an excuse to show that jerk what happens when you MOTIVATE Edward Elric by mocking his shortness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScowling a bit, Hunter was tempted to interject and assure the two that he meant no harm, but figured he'd let the warehouse do the talking for him.  Smirking a bit, he said, \"Welp, we're here!\"  He then opened the doors nice and wide for the Elric brothers.  The two alchemists entered cautiously, expecting bandits, other chimeras, or something nefarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, it was just an abandoned warehouse, furnished nicely with modern accommodations and necessities, several bags, some items that neither Ed nor Al had ever seen before, but more importantly, a nice cushy mattress just as Hunter had promised.  Ed's eyes immediately lit up as he hurried towards the mattress and leaned against it, and noted, \"Wow, these things ARE comfortable!\"  Hunter smiled and proudly said, \"Nothing but the finest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining some composure, Al turned his attention back to Hunter and said, \"Yeah, it's all very nice, but we still have questions!  First of all-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Al and Hunter turned to see Ed plop backwards onto the mattress, already snoring heavily as his massive belly stuck outward like a fleshy bouncing hill atop the young alchemist's middle.  Al facepalmed as Hunter snickered a bit to himself at the ridiculous sight.  \"Hehe, didn't realize the little guy was THAT pooped.\"  He then gulped a bit nervously and pleadingly turned to Al and said, \"Ehhh, actually, please don't tell him I called him that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't, but we still have questions that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter waved his hand, acknowledging Al's inquiry but dismissing its' urgency.  \"I hear ya, Al.  Really.  And when Ed sleeps off that massive gut, I'll answer whatever you guys want.  Honest!  Just, take my word on it, I mean neither'uh Centrals top alchemists nor anyone else any harm.  In fact, I think once you guys get to know me, you'll see I'm not such a bad wolf-guy afterall.  Buuuuuut for now, I think I'm gonna change into something a bit more comfortable.  That okay with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, reluctant, Al nodded as Hunter grinned, and grabbed a duffel bag.  \"Heh, it's funny.  Even though I'm a wolf, people still get all freaked out when I get changed.  I keep telling 'em I got fur all over and no one's gonna see anything they shouldn't, buuuuuut you know how folks are.\"  He then headed out of sight to get changed, leaving only Al and a heavily resting Ed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl scratched his head, still processing what was going on.  <i>What an unusual individual...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ed yawned widely, sitting up on the mattress and stretching his arms far above his head. \"Oh man, what a great nap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, look who it is! Welcome back to the land of the living, Sleeping Beauty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the cheerful voice, Ed's eyes snapped open. Glaring at the speaker, he leaned back on the mattress, resting on his hands. \"Oh, it's you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter only grinned and wagged his tail in response as he squatted by the side of the mattress, his digitigrade legs bending easily. \"A good afternoon to you too, Mr. Elric.\" He'd changed out of his overly bulky clothes earlier, and was now clad in a rather comfy-looking pair of khaki shorts and a sleeveless black tank top. He wore no footwear or socks of any sort, showing his feetlike paws for all the world to see, though he still had his glasses perched on the bridge of his muzzle. \"Ya slept well, I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I slept fine,\" Ed grumbled, pointedly looking away from the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl, who had been carefully looking through some of Hunter's belongings nearby (with an earnest instruction NOT to handle anything too much,), looked towards his big brother reprovingly. \"Brother, be nice! He brought us here so you could rest and gave you a comfy-looking mattress to sleep on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd glared at Hunter. \"Al, for all we know, he could be trying to lull us into a false sense of security!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl rolled his fiery eyes. \"Are you really that worried he'll do something, or are you still upset that he called you pipsqueak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vein popped in Ed's forehead, and he looked away, folding his arms. \"...maybe.\" Hunter chuckled a bit, but quickly stopped when Al turned his attention towards him. \"Still, Ed does have a point: why are you doing all this? Why were you following us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what the hell are you? Are you some sort of Chimera?!\" Ed piped up, looking back at Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro-wolf sighed. \"All valid questions, and I DID promise your little brother I'd give you answers when you woke up.\" With a grunt, he stood back up, walking a bit away from the mattress to give Ed some space before turning around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here's the deal: like I told you, my name's Hunter, and no, I'm not a Chimera. Do you see a snake tail or a goat head anywhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd blinked owlishly. \"Snake? Goat? What the hell...\" His confusion swiftly turned to annoyance as Hunter burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I jest, I jest,\" the wolf managed through his snickers. \"Seriously, though, I'm not an alchemically-created creature, and I'm DEFINITELY not the other kind.\" He snickered a bit more. \"I was born like this, and my whole family's like this, too.\" He got himself under control, clearing his throat and folding his hands/paws behind his back. \"What else ya got for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, it was Al who spoke up. \"Why were you watching Brother stuff himself? I won't deny it's a spectacle, for better or for worse, but I've never seen someone get a kick out of it like you seem to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded, smiling as much as his muzzle would allow. \"Ah yes, that. Well...\" He looked towards the ceiling, appearing to be in thought. \"I suppose I've had a fascination with watching folks like Ed stuff themselves for quite some time now; a good few years, at least.\" He smirked. \"Ah, I was a strange little pup...\" Ed and Al exchanged an utterly befuddled look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...Okay,\" Ed finally spoke up. \"A-anyway, why were you following us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked down from the ceiling. \"Well, there were two reasons for that. One,\" he held up one furry, padded digit, \"It's absolutely hilarious watching folks like you try to make their way around after  anice, big meal. Second,\" he held up another finger, \"I was kinda hoping to reveal myself to you anyway and get you to stuff yourself some more.\" At Ed's bewildered look, Hunter grinned, wagging his tail. \"Hey, I never said I stopped being strange.\" He looked at Ed's midsection. \"Speaking of, you have a rather impressive metabolism, it would seem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Ed inquired, looking down at his stomach. Sure enough, the massive amount of food that had been packed into it had all but vanished, and the appendage had retreated completely beneath his black shirt. It still made a slight indentation in the fabric, but it was barely noticeable unless one looked at it from the right angle. Curious, Ed reached under his shirt and felt his navel, confirming that it was once again a pit. However, Ed noted with a blush, his pants, button, and belt were all still very much busted, and his boxers were still showing. Yelping, he pulled his legs in front of him in an attempt to hide the damage. Hunter, for his part, only chuckled a bit. \"Litlte drafty there, Ed?\" Walking over to his duffel, he began rooting around in it. \"Don't you worry; I got you some new clothes to change into.\" Finding what he was looking for, he tossed the bundle of clothes to the young alchemist, who caught them as the sailed towards him. He examined the garments in his grip, unsure of what to think. \"Um...thanks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled. \"Don't sweat it; what sorta host would I be if I didn't accommodate my guests?\" He gestured towards the back of the warehouse. \"There's a little room back there you can change in, if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd blinked, confused, but smiled a bit in spite of himself. \"...heh. Thanks.\" Tucking the clothes under one arm, and gripping his pants with the other one, he got up off the mattress and made his way towards the room Hunter indicated, vanishing inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl looked towards the wolf. \"That...that was really nice of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged. \"Eh, you two have been through enough crap in your lives; figured it couldn't help to throw you guys a bone, so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl chuckled. \"Thanks, we really-\" He did a double take. \"Wait, what did you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something up, Al?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his brother's voice, Al looked towards Ed as he approached them, as did Hunter. The young alchemist was now clad in a solid red, short-sleeved T-shirt with a flamel emblazoned on the front. Instead of pants, he now wore a pair of white khaki shorts, exposing both his flesh leg and his automail leg. And, instead of boots, he now wore sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter whistled (very odd, considering he didn't have human lips, but that's neither here nor there). \"Lookin' good there, Mr. Elric!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smirked. \"Heh, thanks!\" He tugged on the fabric of his shirt. \"Where did you find a T-shirt with this pattern on it, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked in return. \"Let's just say I know a rather skilled, <i>generous</i> seamstress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl, remembering what Hunter had said, spoke up. \"You look really good, brother, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Ed's stomach growled suddenly. Putting his automail hand to it, he blushed. \"Heh; guess the nap sorta worked up an appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter beamed, tail wagging rapidly. \"Well, Mr. Elric, I daresay that won't be a problem.\" He gestured with his head. \"Follow me: I prepared a load of goodies for ya on the floor right above us. Multi-layered cakes, brownies drenched in vanilla ice cream and powdered sugar, cupcakes, all that good stuff.\" He started walking towards a passageway that presumably led to the stairs, a salivating Ed following close behind. Al, disgruntled at having his question interrupted, nonetheless stayed silent, even as he followed them and privately resolved to find out what Hunter knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the second floor...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ed gaped as Hunter led him and Al into the room where all the goodies were being kept. Much like the first floor, the room was quite nicely-furnished; there was plush carpeting on the floor, a couple of comfy-looking chairs in a couple of the corners of the room, a long, well-stuffed couch at the opposite end, and a large screen of some sort, below which sat an odd-looking box with multiple wires coming out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat caught Ed (and Al's) attention, however, was the large table in the center of the room, which held which was, quite frankly, the largest array of sweets, snacks, and goodies either of them had ever seen. Brownies drenched in powdered sugar were stacked so high they teetered precariously, cakes ranging from three to five-layers with multiple kinds of frosting loomed above the table, piles of ice cream, hot fudge, and every other conceivable topping sat in multiple large sundae dishes, and large, delicious-looking cupcakes were piled on top of one another, with towering plates of cookies beside them. Together, they all emitted an absolutely intoxicating smell, which only made Ed's stomach grumble ever louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked back at them, chuckling at the sight of Ed's jaw dropping and Al's fiery eyes all but encompassing his eye-holes. \"Not bad, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl was the first to regain his power of speech. \"Wha...how...<i>where did you get all of this from?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter mock-frowned. \"What, you think I bought all this?\" He swept an arm across the various goodies on the table. \"All this stuff's baked fresh!\" He winked at Ed. \"Like I told ya guys, nothing but the best.\" The young alchemist could only nod numbly, still taken aback by the bounty before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl, on the other hand, only glanced at the table for a moment longer  before he turned his gaze to Hunter. \"Look, I won't deny it's really nice that you made all this stuff for  Brother,\" he began. He narrowed his eyes, albeit slightly. \"But that still doesn't explain what you meant downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis snapped Ed out of his trance, and he glanced up at his younger brother. \"Meant by what? What're you talking about, Al?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl began to say something, but Hunter cut in. \"While you were changing downstairs, your little brother told me it was really nice of me to give ya new clothes, and, well...\" he rubbed the back of his head, looking somewhat nervous. \"...I was telling him that, after everything you've been through, you didn't really deserve any less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd only paused for a moment before the thought processed. \"Wait a second!\" he demanded, clenching his fists and rounding on Hunter. \"What the hell would you know about me; about EITHER of us?!\" Hunter recoiled a bit, in spite of the fact that he'd somewhat anticipated such a reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl, in spite of his own suspicions, looked down at Ed, surprised at the vehemence of his reaction. \"Ed, calm down!  I was just asking how...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd turned on Al. \"Al, what're you saying? This guy comes outta nowhere, acts all nice, and then all of a sudden he says he knows stuff about us?\" He turned back to Hunter, glaring. \"Have you been spying on us?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter winced. \"W-well, erm...that's kinda a tricky question...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd, gritting his teeth, was about to demand that he answer the question, when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter? You in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was faint but audible, suggesting whoever it belonged to was inside the building, but downstairs. Ed and Al's eyes widened at the voice, the former's anger temporarily forgotten. \"Who the hell was...\" It almost sounded like a kid's voice, albeit one in its preteen years...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, on the other hand, smiled, his ears twitching a bit. \"Don't worry, it's just a friend of mine who came with me as a sort of 'field trip', as it were,\" the wolf replied. He headed for the door, opening it. \"I'll be right back.\" Then, before Ed could renew his accusations, Hunter walked out, closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Hunter had left, Al looked at his elder brother. \"Ed, what are you getting so upset about?\" he asked. \"I mean, yeah, I don't know if I appreciate our privacy being invaded, but he didn't seem like he meant anything by it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd looked at Al, his anger renewed. \"How would you know? We've only just met the bastard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl sighed. \"Look, Brother, I understand you're upset, but I don't think a 'bastard' would give you a nice mattress to rest on, or get you new clothes, OR offer you a feast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point!\" Ed yelled back, startling Al a bit. \"Ever since I became a State Alchemist, we've both done everything we could to hide the fact that we attempted human transmutation, then this guy waltzes along and says he knows about what we went through?\" His eyes intensified. \"What if he talks? What if I get my State Alchemist position revoked? What if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Ed's expression softened, and became one of sorrow. \"What if we can't gain access to whatever we need to to get you your body back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl's eyes widened at this. <i>Brother...</i> he thought, internally kicking himself; why hadn't he thought of that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally, he fumbled for something, anything he could possibly say in response...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a knocking came at the door. \"Um, guys?\" Hunter's voice called out, sounding oddly subdued. \"It's me.\" He paused. \"Can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd and Al looked at each other, shocked; had he heard everything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of this, Al looked toward the door. \"S-sure,\" he replied, inwardly puzzling at the fact that he'd felt the need to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorknob turned, but before the door opened, they heard another voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter, are you sure you're OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd and Al started; it was the voice from earlier. From here, they could tell it definitely belonged to a preteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's voice spoke back.\"Y-yeah, I'm fine. I guess I just, err, didn't expect quite THAT violent a reaction...\"  Ed, in spite of himself, felt a pang of regret. He was still a bit pissed, true, but he sounded so guilty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the other voice spoke, it was full of warmth and reassurance. \"Hunter, you didn't mean anything by it; I know you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's voice sighed. \"Yeah, but they don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence reigned for a moment. Then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, kiddo...I'm really sorry to ask this, but...could you maybe come in with me and help smooth this whole thing over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice promptly replied. \"Sure thing!\" it piped. \"What kind of friend would I be if I just let ya go in there alone? Besides, \" it added, a bit of eagerness entering its voice, \"I've kinda been wanting to meet them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the brothers' surprise, Hunter chuckled a bit. \"Well, I'm sure they'll absolutely love you. Just, uh, lemme prep 'em...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorknob turned the rest of the way, and the door opened slightly, Hunter's head poking in. \"Uh, guys?\" he began, looking down a bit. \"I'm, err, bringing that guy I told you about in with me. Just, uh, don't freak, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd and Al glanced at each other confused. Nonetheless, they looked back at Hunter and nodded. Sighing in relief a bit, Hunter opened the door the rest of the way, walking into the room. Right after, though, someone else walked in behind him. And, in spite of having just met the anthropomorphic wolf, Ed and Al's eyes widened. \"Wh-what the hell...\" Ed muttered, disbelieving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's companion, for his part, only giggled, squinting his eyes shut and folding his arms behind his head. As expected, he appeared to be in his preteen years...and, like Hunter, wasn't human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young creature was covered, head to toe, in bright orange fur, with a long, slender muzzle and black markings around his eyes that extended upwards into his oddly rabbit-like ears. The eyes themselves, which he blinked open, were red, with slitted pupils that nonetheless shone with curiosity and energy. His hands were oddly human-esque, albeit with claws at the end, and digitigrade legs much like Hunter's. And, like the wolf, he wore clothing: specifically, a sleeveless red t-shirt, with an open vest over it that had a long sleeve on one side, with a red armband worn around the wrist of his exposed arm. In addition, he wore baggy orange trousers, with a black belt looped around the waist. Owing to the structure of his legs and feet/paws, he wore no footwear of any kind. However, the most startling feature about him had to be the nine large, bushy tails sticking out from his backside, waving about a bit behind him. He appeared to be, in short, a nine-tailed fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya!\" the young creature exclaimed, lowering his arms and walking towards Ed. He extended a hand. \"I'm Kurama! Nice to meetcha!\" Ed, for his part, could only gape dumbly at the young creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Where are your manners?\" urged Al as his metallic elbow nudged into a still gaping Ed, promptly snapping him out of his dumbfounded trance.  \"H-huh?\" sputtered Ed, before Al gestured back at the young nine tailed fox; hand still extended outward.  \"Oh...OH!  H-heh, y-yeah, sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPromptly, but somewhat cautiously, Ed shook Kurama's hand, working up a slight smirk while the young Tailed Beast beamed happily at him.  \"Nice to meet you too, Kurama.  I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Edward Elric!\"  Kurama interjected eagerly, catching Ed off guard as Kurama turned his head upward towards Al and offered his other hand towards the suit of armor.  \"And you must be Alphonse Elric!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling somewhat at the young creatures' eagerness and pep, Al promptly shook his hand.  Hunter; for his part though, snickered as he watched the eager young fox shaking the hands of both befuddled Elric's at the same time.  Finally, Kurama released their hands and once again wrapped them behind his head, smiling at the two as Ed turned his attention over to Hunter somewhat and said, \"So, your buddy Hunter filled you in on us, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama happily bobbed his head.  \"Yep!  Sure did!  And I gotta say, I've been REALLY excited about meeting you guys ever since!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, both Elric brothers glanced at one another, before Ed turned to the fox and asked, \"...You have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure!  Alchemy sounds really awesome!  Ya see, where I live now, we have magic.  My mentor; Natsu, taught me how to manipulate fire and combine it with my own natural chakra abilities from where I initially came from!\"  As Kurama explained, things just seemingly went right over both dumbfounded Elric's heads, until Kurama demonstrated, by summoning a tiny flame in his palm, startling Ed somewhat.  \"See?  I mean, it's still just the bare basic stuff, but Natsu says I'm a REAL fast learner!\"  Kurama added, squinting his eyes shut as he grinned with no small amount of pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Ed snickered slightly, catching Al's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny, Brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh, nothing.  Guess I just figured all Fire Alchemists were jerks...turns out, it's just Mustang...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl rolled his fiery eyes yet again.  \"Brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nonetheless, Kurama wiped his hand clean of fire and turned his attention back to Ed.  \"But see, the ability to create stuff; turn somethin' in another thing entirely?  That's incredibly cool!  And your title?  I can't think of anything more cool sounding than 'The FullMetal Alchemist!'\"  Upon hearing that, Ed couldn't help but grin with pride.  \"Heh...guess it IS a pretty heavy title, huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama nodded eagerly.  \"Sure is!  But...\"  At this, Kurama's expression softened a bit, \"...the biggest reason I wanted to meet you guys was because...Hunter told me what you guys have been through.\"  His expression seemed genuinely saddened as he looked up at the two young Alchemists.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to himself, Hunter stepped in, palm rested gently on Kurama's shoulder as he glanced apologetically at the two brothers.  \"Look, I'm...I'm sorry you guys didn't appreciate the whole 'spying on you' dealio.  But I travel a lot, see; not from place to place, but from world to world; dimension to dimension.  I'm a bit on the...eccentric side, sure, but I'm very much a people person, and I like meeting interesting people in whatever world or dimension I visit.  I also have a lotta friends who can, touch up and look into people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, a look of anger once again returned to Ed's face, but it was notably softer as Hunter went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But it's only so I know what they're about.  And...when I heard what you guys had been through, it...it broke my heart...\"  Both Elric almost recoiled a bit, knowing exactly what Hunter was getting at.  But there was genuine sadness in Hunter's expression...and doubly so for Kurama.  Something that wasn't lost on either Alchemist, despite their own current expressions.  \"That's the biggest reason I wanted to meet you guys, above all else, above even watching Ed stuff his face and be all goofy...because you guys have had it really rough, and, well, I just wanted to show you guys a real fun time.  To help take your mind off the heavy stuff for just a lil bit, and, just have fun.  Honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Elric knew what to say at this point.  It all seemed very suspicious on the surface, sure, but Hunter seemed so genuine and sincere, as did his young fox friend.  Was it possible that this stranger really did just want to give these two overworked Alchemists a break from the stress of the day to day?  To just kick back and have fun for a bit?  Only one question kept popping into the elder Elric's mind, until finally, he asked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why?  Why would you care about showing a complete stranger; no matter how rough their lives might have been, a good time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hunter could answer, Kurama stepped forward, smiling a warm, genuine smile and said, \"...Because he's a good person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Elric's turned their attention back to Kurama who looked up at Hunter, smiling; what they perceived to be, a smile of pure gratitude, before he turned back to the Elric's and explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the first ones he's visited to try and show a fun time.  See, when I was a kit...Hunter helped save me from...\"  Kurama winced noticeably...the memories and nightmares of a horrible future that could have been, still burdened his mind, but nonetheless, he went on.  \"...H-he helped save me from something...something really bad.  He went out of his way to help me find a home where I could have an actual future...have friends...have a life...\"  And as the young fox thought back to a certain blond boy who stood besides him all the way, he smiled warmly and added, \"...and thanks to him, I know what it means to have a brother.  He didn't have to do all that stuff for me, but he did, because he's one of the most caring, kindest, people you can meet...and someone I'm incredibly grateful to call my friend...because without him...I wouldn't be here now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with things being as tense as they were, Hunter's heart welled up exponentially as he heard the young fox tell his side of things.  He fought hard not to wrap his arms around the Tailed Beast and hug him tightly then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, his words were genuine, that much was all but certain to the Elric's.  Considering that, Al looked down at Ed, whose expression had softened exponentially, and asked, \"...Well, Ed?  What do you say?  Should we trust him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back at Hunter, then back at Kurama, Ed sighed softly...then smiled a reluctant, but genuine smile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, Al...this kid doesn't seem like a liar, and Hunter DID make one helluva tasty looking feast here.  So, I guess...if Kurama here says we can trust him...then I trust him.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd eventually smiled warmly and offered his hand to Hunter, who smiled gratefully and shook Ed's hand right back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh...and...call me pipsqueak again...?  And you'll be eating steaks through a straw...\"  added Ed with an almost eerily demonic tone in his voice.  Gulping nervously, Hunter nonetheless smiled and nodded.  \"C-Consider it a deal...h-heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nonetheless, Hunter regained composure and smiled back at the Elric brothers.  \"Really, though, I appreciate you guys giving me a chance.  And I think once you get to know me, you'll see that I'm not such a bad wolf.  In fact, I think we'll all get along pretty damn well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smirked and said, \"Guess we'll see.\"  He then turned his attention to Kurama and added, \"...Buuuut something tells me you might just be right, Hunter...\"  For emphasis, Ed playfully nudged Kurama in the arm, causing the young fox to giggle and nudge Ed right back, earning a chuckle from him and Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil a loud rumble once again emitted from Ed's stomach, causing him to chuckle before turning his attention over to the table and licking his lips.  \"Well, I dunno bout'chu guys, but I see some goodies with my name on it...soooo if ya don't mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost comically, Ed darted over to the table, and wasted no time stuffing his maw with whatever sweets he could possibly fit into it, much to the amusement of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Al turned his attention to Hunter and Kurama, and; after rubbing the back of his metallic head...</span></div></div>",

I mean, Hunter's a wolf-person, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled, squinting his eyes shut. \"Heehee, I know what you meant; I was just bein' silly.\" Turning all the way to Al, he folded his arms behind his head. \"Well, before you ask, I'm not a fox-person...at least, not in the way that Hunter's a wolf-person.\" He glanced over at Hunter, who smiled. Smiling in return, Kurama looked back toward Al. \"Heck, I didn't even learn to walk on my hind legs 'till a while after I met him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl blinked. \"So...what kind of nine-tailed fox are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smiled at Al, then took a deep breath, as though preparing to launch into some sort of explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, the thing is, I'm actually one of nine creatures-the Tailed Beasts-beings of pure chakra.\" At Al's confused look, he giggled. \"Basically energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl, confused, simply nodded...then poked at Kurama a bit. Squirming, Kurama playfully swatted Al's hand away. \"What'cha doin', Alphonse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit taken aback, Al nonetheless replied, \"Pl-please, just call me Al. A-anyway, I was just seeing if you were solid. I mean, you don't SEEM like a being of pure energy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama snickered. \"I'm not just a mass of energy shaped like a fox; I got bones, organs, skin, fur...pretty much what everyone else has.\" He winked at Al. \"They just happen to be made outta solidified chakra instead of...whatever most people's bodies are made out of.\" At Al's slightly bemused nod of understanding, he continued. \"Anyhow, we all used to be part of something called the Ten-Tails...basically an ancient, primordial force of destruction...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl was sure that if he still had a mouth, he'd be gaping at this revelation. Ed, for his part, paused, his eyes wide open and a spoonful of ice cream halfway to his mouth. Hunter, on the other hand, simply snickered, putting a paw to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning a bit himself, Kurama went on. \"Anyway, someone the humans called the 'Sage of Six Paths'...\" at this, an expression somewhere between fondness and pain flitted across his face, but he wiped it from his face before Al could comment. \"...came along, defeated the Ten-Tails, and split its chakra into nine separate pieces.\" A warm smile came across his muzzle. \"Then, he used his powers to take each of those pieces, give them new forms, new personalities, new souls, and, well...\" he gestured at himself. \"Basically, the Old Man created all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl, noticing the fond look on Kurama's face, asked, \"...you really cared about him, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama sighed wistfully. \"Yeah. He...he was like a dad to all of us.\" Kurama turned his head away, but Al could still see his eyes beginning to moisten. Eager to steer the topic in a less melancholy direction, Al \"cleared\" his \"throat.\" \"So! Erm, you said someone was teaching you magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama looked back up at Al, a bright smile coming to his face. \"Oh yeah! Where I'm living now, there are so many wizards, they end up forming their own guilds to study magic.\" Smirking, he jabbed a thumb at himself. \"Me, I'm a member of Fairy Tail, the greatest guild in all of Fiore!....that's the name of the land where I live now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Al replied, nodding. \"And...what exactly does your world's magic do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, all kinds of things!\" Kurama replied eagerly. \"There's fire magic, like I showed you guys earlier, Maker Magic--which is basically manipulating any kind of element, from ice to wood and everything in between---, Celestial Spirit Magic, which is summoning beings to fight for you...\" he grinned. \"And my personal favorite, aside from fire...\" He closed his eyes and concentrated. Internally, Al raised an eyebrow....before Kurama's clothes lit up and emitted a flash of light. Al recoiled, and Ed, noticing the flash, glanced over, an eclair sticking out of his mouth. \"Wh-what in the...\" Al stammered. Hunter, knowing what was coming, merely smirked. Confused, Al looked back at Kurama...only for his eyes to widen once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama stood there, grinning cheekily...and wearing a completely different set of clothes. Instead of the ensemble he'd been wearing previously, he was now clad in a sleeveless tank top much like Hunter's, save that it was red, with orange lining around the neck. He wore a black, opened button-down shirt over it. with sleeves that stopped before the wrists. He wore light blue trousers that were noticeably less baggy than his previous ones. And, around his forehead, he wore a long, white piece of cloth wrapped below his ears, the untied ends of which dangled down to his upper back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one said anything for a moment, between Kurama's grin, Ed and Al's dumbfounded expressions, and Hunter's struggle to not crack up. Predictably, it was Ed who eventually broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what the hell was that?!\" Ed exclaimed, holding his half-eaten eclair in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama turned towards Ed, smirking good-naturedly. \"Requip Magic,\" Kurama answered, rocking on his feet a bit. \"Basically, you can store anything, from weapons to clothes, in your own personal pocket dimension and bring it out whenever ya need it.\" He chuckled a bit. \"There's this one mage in my guild, Erza, who's REALLY good with Requip Magi; she's got dozens of armors, tons of weapons...and she KNOWS how to use 'em.\" He rubbed the back of his head, smiling sheepishly. \"I'm nowhere near as good as she is; I can only store a few outfits and some knicknacks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter walked over to him and put a hand on his shoulder. \"I think you're sellin' yourself short, kid; you're still young, but you've already learned a lot.\" He winked at the young Nine-Tails. \"Just imagine what you'll be able to learn in ten years, twenty years...heck, for all you know, you might end up being the next Guild Master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama looked back at Hunter, his eyes widened, but his expression undeniably grateful. \"Y-you really think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter winked at him, giving him a playful slug with his other hand. \"I know so.\" His expression turned mischievous. \"Heck, you're already multi-talented...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama tilted his head. \"Huh? What're you talkin' about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Hunter looked back over at Ed. \"Hey, Ed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChomping down on what was left of a doughnut, the young Alchemist glanced back at him. \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes glinting, Hunter continued. \"Whaddaya think of the goodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping the mouthful down, Ed nodded, smirking. \"Heh, they're actually really damn good! I feel like I'm inhaling everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled. \"That so?\" Kurama's eyes widened, realizing what Hunter was getting at. \"H-Hunter, do you hafta...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinking at the young creature, Hunter pointed at Kurama. \"Well, if ya wanna thank someone, thank the fuzzball here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd and Al both gaped at Kurama. \"Hold on...you...you MADE all this?!\" Al exclaimed. \"It looks like something you'd find in a bakery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd scoffed. \"A bakery? Pfft, these things taste WAY better than anything I ever got from one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama reddened under his fur, grasping his hands behind his back and glancing away, unable to keep a smile from his muzzle. \"Aw, c'mon, you guys are too nice...\" <i>Besides, they're nothing compared to Rocket's goodies...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing a bit at Kurama's expression, Ed turned around and immediately went back to stuffing his face. Hunter, for his part, gave Kurama a companionable shake of the shoulder. \"Kid, we gotta get you to take compliments WITHOUT turning red as a tomato...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl, for his part, simply chuckled a bit. \"Don't worry too much, Kurama; a little humility never hurt anybody...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama glanced up at the animate suit of armor. He said nothing, but shrugged, giggling as he did so....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hunter chuckled along with the young fox and added, \"To be perfectly fair though, kiddo...Rocket HAS earned the right to be cocky about how great his cooking is...\"  And at that, Kurama licked his chops and rubbed his stomach fondly.  \"...Boy has he...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl couldn't help but chuckle, while Ed continued to greedily stuff more baked goodies into his all-too-eager maw.  Then, Kurama turned to Al, smiling back at the suit of armor and with notable interest, asked, \"So, Alphon-err...Al, could'ja tell me a lil bit about yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Al almost nervously pointed a finger up at his helmet and asked, \"M-me?  You want to know about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama bobbed his head eagerly and said, \"Well sure I do!  You seem like a really nice and really smart guy, and I just wanna, get to know ya a lil better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling as he rubbed the back of his metallic head somewhat, Al shrugged and said, \"W-well, my name's Al, as you know.  I'm Edward's younger brother, and; like Ed, I'm a State Alchemist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama beamed and said, \"H-heh, sorry if it seems like I'm kinda overly eager...but I just find the whole concept'uh Alchemy to just be sooooo cool, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Al chuckled.  \"Well, I suppose it <i>is</i> pretty cool, in all truth.  It's not only a great means of defense, but in our case, it's also really helpful with shelter, construction, anything really.  I don't think we'd have survived this long were it not for Alchemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning impishly, Kurama looked up at Al and added, \"Hehe, bet'cha kick tons'uh butt when jerks try'n mess with you guys, huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MPH THRN SRMPH!\"  replied Ed with a mouthful of sticky buns.  Rolling his fiery eyes, Al shook his head and added, \"Brother, please don't try and talk with your mouthful.\"  Nodding, Ed winced and gulped heartily, sending the rather large bulge in his cheeks, full of pastries, right down his throat and into his gullet.  Sighing with satisfaction, Ed licked his lips, grinned cockily and said, \"And THEN some, was what I was tryin' to say.  Seriously, you guys wouldn't believe the amount'uh dumbasses Al'n I come across, pulling scams, terrorizing innocent people...<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">or being a certain jackass named Mustang</font>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother, <i>honestly</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaaat?\"  Ed inquired innocently, before eagerly returning to his meal, earning another round of giggles from Kurama as he looked back at Al and noted, \"Hehe, guess that means y'er the 'mature one' of the two, huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling despite the fact, Al shrugged his metal shoulders and said, \"Without question...y'know, a lot of times we first introduce ourselves, people often mistake me for the older sibling.  Time was, I used to just think it was because my current body is...errr...<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">a bit taller than Edward</font>...but these days, I think it's more about how we carry ourselves.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to say my brother's immature...but compared to me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Kurama and Hunter snickered a bit as the wolf added, \"...Compared to you, he's like a smaller, way smarter version'uh Naruto.\"  This once again earned another round of snickers from the two, while Al tilted his head, curious who this 'Naruto' was.  Nonetheless, he looked back at Ed greedily stuffing his face and smirked some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonetheless, when push comes to shove, Brother always knows what to do.  He takes charge when needed, he's there for anyone who needs him, and he works harder than anyone I've ever known in my entire life.  Frankly, he's the best older brother someone could hope ask for...I can't even imagine where I'd be if it weren't for him...so I suppose it's hard to ever <i>really</i> fault his immaturity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiterally no sooner than Al said that, Ed winced for a moment, thumped his chest a few times, burped loudly, smiled to himself, and dove right back in for more, causing Al to sweatdrop a bit with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Case in point...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling some more, Kurama soon stopped for a moment and really thought about what Al had said, before smiling warmly at the suit of armor and saying, \"...Y'know something, Al?  I know exactly what'cha mean.  My best friend in the whole world means everything to me.  He's the closest to a big brother as I'll ever have, and if it weren't for him, I...well, let's just say, I'd rather not imagine where I'd be without him in my life either...\"  He giggled a bit more and added, \"...And trust me, no matter how immature YOUR big brother may seem...he doesn't even COMPARE to Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, at this, Al raised an 'eyebrow' and added, \"...I wouldn't be too sure about that, Kurama.  Brother once went on a two minute screaming rant fit until he ran out breath and passed out, cause someone called him a 'little fella'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama raised an eyebrow himself, grinning cockily as he added, \"Oh yeah?  Naruto and another friend; Kiba, would argue before and after every single meal over who could and did eat more than the other...\"  Hunter snickered to himself, recalling a lil Naruto and Kiba going back and forth at every turn; each one cocky and confident in their abilities to outdo the other...despite everything almost always ending in a tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stared at each other for a moment, then both burst into a fit of snickers for a good while before Al said, \"Hehe, guess all big brothers are the same, huh...\"  Kurama bobbed his head and said, \"...And I wouldn't have it any other way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kurama's smile faded a bit as he saw Al turn his attention back to Ed, and more specifically, all the baked goods Kurama had made for the young alchemist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Umm, Al?  C-can I ask ya something...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Al once again turned his attention to Kurama, a bit surprised by his sudden apprehension.  \"Sure, what's up, Kurama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama rubbed his arm a bit nervously and asked, \"...W-what's it like, having that suit of armor for a body...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd gulped down his current mouthful and stopped eating as he looked back at Al with concern and sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl; for his part, sighed softly as he examined himself.  \"...Honestly, it's...it's difficult.  Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of advantages.  For instance, I never get tired, so I have infinite endurance.  It's quite sturdy, so I can take a hit as well as I can deliver one.  I don't need to breathe, ever need to use the restroom, get hungry, thirsty, and I don't even have to worry about falling apart, since I can reform this armor with alchemy...provided my blood seal isn't damaged.  But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama looked up sympathetically as he saw Al's expression darken a bit.  Hunter was painfully aware of what the two had endured as children, but to hear first hand what Al was going through, filled his heart with sadness as Al went on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Those things are as much a burden as they are a benefit.  I miss so much about life that I took for granted.  Being able to enjoy a nice meal, smelling the fresh air and life around me, feeling a simple breeze against my skin...or just...being able to sleep...and to dream.  I could dream about our mother...the good times...even dreaming about what the future could have in store of me.  It's difficult...but I endure, and I will continue to endure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Because no matter what it takes; no matter how LONG it takes, I WILL find a way to give Al his body back...\"  added Ed with determination and fire in his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama's eyes went a bit misty as he smiled at Al and warmly rested his palm against the younger Elric's metal body.  \"...I'm so sorry.  I...I can't imagine what that must be like...but I know for a fact with 100% certainty that you're gonna get'cher body back.  Because your big brother said he'll help you get your back back, and trust me when I say this; big brothers will move Heaven and Earth to help their younger siblings.  Mine helped me have a chance at living...and yours will help you live your life again.\"  Despite himself, Kurama grinned somewhat playfully and said, \"...I can spot a great big brother a mile away, and your big brother is as great as they come, because he clearly cares about you with all his being.  Just never forget that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Elric's were completely taken back.  Not only by the sincerity in the young fox's words, but the certainty...the matter-of-fact assurance that came from his young voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Al still had eyes, they'd be welling with tears.  Instead, his fiery eyes looked down, gleaming with gratitude as he 'smiled' at the young creature, placing a palm gently against the Tailed Beast's shoulder and rather softly, said, \"...Thanks, Kurama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama looked up at the younger Elric and smiled right back.  Hunter simply watched and smiled warmly at the scene.  Part of what he loved about Kurama wasn't just his kind and gentle nature, but also how empathetic he was towards others, even if he'd just met them the way he had the Elric Brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know something, Kurama?\" remarked Ed, breaking the silence, before smiling back at the young fox and adding, \"...You're alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the young fox beamed happily, causing both Elric's to chuckle softly, when suddenly, Ed's stomach decides to break the ice by growling almost angrily as he chuckles a bit sheepishly and says, \"Eheh, sorry.  Kurama's baking is so damn good, I don't think my stomach'll even LET me stop eating...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Ed licked his lips and dove right back in for more, much to the amusement of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wow, he even EATS like Naruto...\" noted Kurama, earning another fit of snickers from him and Al.  Hunter's focus shifted to Kurama and Al.  It was nice seeing them bond as Ed stuffed his face comically...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hunter, Al, and Kurama watched as Ed continued stuffing his face, none of them able to tear their eyes away...albeit for different reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl was equal parts amazed-Ed had just finished sleeping off a MASSIVE meal, and here he was cramming baked goodies into his mouth like there was no tomorrow-and exasperated. It was bad enough when Ed had been stuffing his face in public, broken his clothes, and popped his navel, but here, where there was no one else besides the four of them present? If Al still had a body, he knew he would have shuddered. <i>Brother...how far are you planning to go...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, on the other hand, was smirking. <i>Heh, lookit him go,</i> the wolf thought, tail wagging. <i>Guess eating for both him AND Al really works up an appetite...then again, he was probably like that even before...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf's expression fell slightly at this, remembering what he'd learned about the brothers...but then the smile quickly returned to his face. <i>And if he's enjoying himself NOW....?</i> His gaze wandered over to Al, still too engrossed by the sight of his elder brother gorging himself to notice. <i>Wait'll they see that this is only the tip of the iceberg in regards to what I've got planned...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Kurama, he found himself flushing a bit with pride when he saw the enthusiasm with which Ed was eating his goodies. <i>W-wow,</i> he thought, smiling a bit, <i>he really DOES like my goodies, doesn't he?</i> He rubbed the back of his head a bit. <i>I'm nowhere NEAR as good as Rocket is...but it's nice to see people enjoying the stuff I've made.</i> He giggled a bit, remembering exactly how much Natsu and Happy had enjoyed a spread he'd prepared for them; by the time they'd finished, Natsu had busted his belt, his belly pressing into the table, and Happy had been splayed out on his back on the table, swollen belly sticking up and an expression of delirious contentment on his face. <i>And if Ed eats all of THAT....hee hee, his tummy's gonna be REALLY big...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, after Ed gulped down a large piece of cake, he sighed, slouching back in his chair. \"Oh man,\" he muttered, turning his chair around so he could face the others. \"That stuff's amazing, but...whew...really fills ya up quick...\" To punctuate this, he brought a hand up to his belly, gently rubbing it as he licked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the grand majority of the goodies on the table remained uneaten, enough had been consumed to have a visible effect on the young alchemist's stomach. His belly had bulged visibly underneath his shirt; not enough for any flesh to be peeking out, but enough to appear as a distinctive round shape underneath his t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing this, Al facepalmed. \"Brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter gave the younger Elric a playful smirk. \"Oh, come on, Al; just goes to show how much he's enjoying his 'little' meal...\" He turned toward Kurama and gave the fox a playful jab on the shoulder. \"Well, kid? Looks like a positive review, don'tcha think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama flushed red and laughed, sheepishly rubbing the back of his head. \"Y-yeah, I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Ed opened his eyes and looked toward Kurama. \"Ah, c'mon, learn to take a compliment!\" He happily patted his belly. \"These are some of the best damn desserts I've ever eaten! No reason to be so shy about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kurama flushed redder and looked down, folding his hands behind his back. \"M-maybe...\" He looked up, somewhat reluctantly. \"You really like 'em that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Ed once again patted his bulging belly. \"Why don't ya come over here and take a closer look at this; maybe that'll give you your answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling sheepishly, Kurama nodded. \"Well, I guess it can't hurt...\" Still flushing a bit, he made his way over to Ed, who was  still rubbing his belly. Looking down at the appendage, Kurama's eyes widened. \"Wow...you musta really enjoyed my baking...\" Almost on reflex, he reached out and poked the still-concealed flesh....then flushed even redder as he realized what he'd done. \"E-Ed, I'm so sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his (and Al's) surprise, Ed laughed. \"Heh, you think THAT'S impressive?\" He patted his belly with both hands. \"You shoulda seen me after I won that eating contest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned. \"Oh yeah, Hunter told me you were competing in one! How big was your tummy then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smirked. \"Weeeeelll....broke my pants and belt, popped my navel out...you tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of himself, Kurama giggled. \"Heh, that IS way bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd looked back at the goodies still on the table. \"Yeah, and \"way bigger\" is what my gut's gonna be once I finish all this stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl's fiery eyes widened. \"Brother...are you SERIOUSLY gonna eat EVERYTHING on that table...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd looked back at his younger brother, giving a playful grin. \"C'mon, Al, food this tasty? It'd be a crime NOT to eat it.\" Al rolled his eyes, shaking his head in exasperation. Laughing a bit at his younger brother's resigned mood, Ed patted his belly with both hands. \"Still, I gotta rest this off for a few minutes first; wanna be at my best when I dig back in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama tilted his head. <i>A few minutes?</i> he thought, his ears twitching. He smiled. <i>Well, might as well ask while he's not eating...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing his throat, the young fox looked at the resting Alchemist. \"Hey, Ed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd paused in his ministrations, looking up at Kurama. \"Yeah, Kurama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a breath, Kurama replied...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Face flushing red with embarrassment, Kurama chuckled sheepishly and grasped at his stomach protectively, as though attempting to shut it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd blinked for a moment, then laughed heartily, much to Al and Hunter's surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would'ja need to ask?  You MADE these goodies, Kurama!  Course ya can join me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's tails started to wave behind him happily as his face lit up with a hopeful smile.  \"Really?  Ya mean it?\"  Once again, Ed laughed as he said, \"Course I do!  Besides, you seem such like a nice person, and this could give us a chance to talk a bit.\"  Eagerly and gratefully, Kurama promptly sat across from a smiling Ed, much to Hunter's amusement and Al's relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Phew...well, at least now Brother won't be able to eat EVERYTHING on the table anymore...</i>  The younger Elric thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, how'd ya get to be so good at baking?  I mean, I don't think I've ever met anyone so young that could bake stuff better than nearly any bakery I've ever visited!\"  Ed said, giving his belly a hearty pat for emphasis.  Chuckling, Kurama rubbed the back of his head and smiled bashfully at the elder Elric brother.  \"Hehe, weeeeeell, I guess it all started with Termina.  See, my friend; Rocket, he's WAVELENGTHS better than I am at cooking.  In fact, he's the greatest cook I've ever been lucky enough to know!  And after I made it to Fiore, I kinda wanted to see if I could learn to cook even half as good as him.  And one of the guild members; Elfman, he cooks amazingly too!  He showed he some of the bare basics, but then he told me there were tons of cook books at the Guild Library.  So I studied those long and hard.  Tried, failed, tried some more, and gradually, people started really liking what I baked or cooked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked and added, \"Any books in that Library teach ya how to accept complements, kiddo?\"  At that, Kurama once again blushed and chuckled sheepishly.  But Ed nodded in agreement and said, \"He's right, you know.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with being proud of what you do, ESPECIALLY when it's as undeniably delicious as all this stuff has been!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled somewhat uneasily and nodded slightly as he said, \"I know, really, it's just...kiiiiiiinda hard to accept when anyone says anything I've baked is the best anything they've eaten.  Cause I know no matter how good what I make is, it'll NEVER be anywhere near as good as what Elfman and Rocket can make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Ed scoffed and added, \"So what?  I mean, I've never tasted what those two can make, and if you say it's as good as it is, I'll take your word on it, but just because someone else is better at something, doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to appreciate your own efforts.  Hell, you should never have to compare yourself to anyone regarding ANYTHING.  Appreciate what you do for YOU, cause that's all anyone can ever hope for.  Nothing should ever lessen your accomplishments just because you think someone else is better.  The only thing that matters is that you do your best, and no one could ask for anything more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama stopped for a moment, and appeared as though in deep thought.  \"Huh.  Y'know, I...I never actually thought of it like that before.  Y-you really think that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd chuckled and said, \"Look, there's no harm in wanting to be better at anything.  Hell, that's GREAT that no matter how good you are, you're always striving to be better.  That shows you have drive and are willing to learn, and that's important, because we're ultimately NEVER done learning anything.  But that doesn't mean you can't appreciate where you are at any given step.\"  Ed stopped and smirked back at Kurama as he added, \"...<i>especially</i> when it's undeniable that you've got the skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama glanced back at Ed and smiled an appreciative smile.  \"...Thanks, Ed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Al couldn't help but smile at the scene.  For all his goofiness and crassness, Ed always knew how to talk to people, and how to help them appreciate themselves a little better.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the young fox's stomach rumbled HUNGRILY again, causing his face to flush bright red beneath his orange fur, once again causing Ed to burst into a fit of laughter while Hunter and even Al began to snicker with amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, ya really ARE hungry, aren'tcha, kiddo!  I thought that was a freakin' lion for a second there,\" remarked Hunter as the young Tailed Beast rubbed the back of his head and nodded slightly.  \"Eheheh...w-well, baking DOES work up an appetite...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill chuckling as he regained composure, Ed wiped his face and glanced back at Kurama.  \"Sounds like it works up more than that.\"  Then he thought for a moment and asked, \"Say, Kurama...when you asked me how big my belly got at the eating contest, why were ya curious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama scratched his fuzzy cheek and shrugged, \"I'm always curious when I hear someone's eating lots'uh food!  I mean, I always figured the only ones who did that were my friends and I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd blinked, taking a closer look at the lean young fox, then added, \"Wait, YOU stuff your face too?\"  Kurama giggled and said, \"Course I do!  I LOVE food, and I love having as much of it in my tummy as I can possibly get!  Why, first thing Hunter and I did when we arrived in Fiore was go to this one buffet and eat so much that our tummies actually got wedged between the booth and the table!  And THAT was when I was still just a kit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl blinked dully and turned almost blankly at Hunter.  \"...Et tu, Hunter...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned toothily at Al and gave his stomach a hearty pat.  \"Guilty as charged!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl sighed to himself and slapped his palm against his face.  <i>Great...I'm <u>literally</u> surrounded by gluttons...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd, on the other hand, just laughed.  \"Damn, wedged into a booth?  Now THAT'S awesome!  But didn't that hurt?\"  Kurama shrugged again, still smiling.  \"Eh, it wasn't the most comfortable experience.  Buuuuuut I didn't mind, cause it just meant I got to spend more time with one of my closest friends.  And how could I complain about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Hunter once again felt a hitch in his chest as his heart warmed up exponentially.  He smiled fondly at the young fox and thought, <i>...If ever there were a sweeter kid in the whole damn universe...our hearts would literally melt into pudding...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama then grinned somewhat impishly and added, \"Plus, Hunter knew how to speed up the process so that way our tummies would deflate enough for us to slip out, and MAN was it awesome...course I was still embarrassed about it back when I was a kit, buuuuut less so these days...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl once again turned to Hunter, and; in a completely deadpanned voice, asked,  \"...Do I even <i>want</i> to ask...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned playfully back at Al and shook his head.  \"You do <i>not</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Ed sat back for a moment, then with a grin, turned back to Kurama and said...</span></div></div>",

I love tasting everything, and I love when I eat so much I get a big tummy...and the best part is, combined with my metabolism-part and parcel of being a being of pure energy-and the fact that I live a really active lifestyle, I don't hafta worry about gaining any permanent weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's eyes lit up. \"That right?\" At Kurama's eager nod, his grin widened. \"In that case...why don't ya show me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blinked his eyes open. \"Show you?\" He repeated. It took only half a second for the question to process...then a mischievous gleam of his own appeared in his eyes. \"You mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Al let loose with a long-suffering groan, already figuring out what Ed was suggesting. Hunter, on the other hand, snickered.  \"Brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Ed leaned forward. \"Yep. Feel like an eating contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes lit up, even as he adopted a mock-thoughtful look. \"Hmm, lemme think about that...Sure!\" He finished the exclamation by bringing his arms down and placing his hands on the table. Ed, unable to help himself, laughed at the young tod's exuberance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's grin became cocky. \"Before we start, though, I just wanna give ya fair warning...\" At this, Ed stopped laughing and looked at Kurama curiously. Al blinked slowly, dreading what he was going to hear. Hunter? Well, he was trying not to burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back home, in Fiore,\" Kurama went on, smirking, \"I have a reputation as one of the guild's biggest eaters, second only to my pal and mentor, Natsu. In fact,\" he added, getting into it, \"when it comes to eating contests on a job,\" he jabbed a thumb at himself, \"I'm my guild's trump card.\" He allowed himself a cocky grin. \"You know what my opponents call me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smirked in return. \"What?\" he challenged, even as he felt eagerness brewing within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned widely, exposing his sharp teeth. \"<i>Fairy Tail's Bottomless Pit</i>,\" he replied, his voice dramatically hushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter beamed, knowing that statement was 100% true...and then some. Al, on the other hand, only groaned and slammed both palms to his face. <i>This is going to get out of hand, isn't it...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, seeing this, looked over at Al. \"Ah, c'mon, Al,\" the wolf said lightly, slugging him on the arm...before wincing and shaking it out. \"It's all in good fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl gave Hunter a \"look\"...or at least, as best he could given his metal body. \"No offense, Hunter, but seeing my big brother stuff himself until he looks like he's having babies isn't my idea of 'fun'...\" He sighed. \"Plus, him getting a tummyache won't be any fun either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, for his part, only chuckled, turning his head away. <i>Ah, don't be like that,</i> he thought. A grin lit his face up...one he was sure to hide from the brothers AND Kurama. <i>Who knows? You might be changing your tune very, very soon...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to any of this, Ed whistled. \"Bottomless pit, huh?\" he repeated. \"Gotta say, that's pretty impressive...buuuut as you probably figured, I'm not exacty a slouch myself.\" He patted his somewhat stuffed, yet still-concealed belly. \"You forgetting your opponent just won an eating contest earlier today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled. \"Nope, I didn't...but you better bring your A+ game to this one, Ed,\" he retorted. \"Fairy Tail members never do anything halfway...\" He grinned. \"...so I'm gonna give it everything I got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd laughed, sitting upright and pulling himself closer to the table. \"Well, then, you're in luck...cause I'm not gonna pull my punches either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama sat back, folding his arms and smirking. \"I'd be insulted if you did,\" he said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smirked in return....right before both their bellies rumbled loudly. Blushing at the sheer volume, they clutched their midsections. \"Erm...maybe we should stop with the pissing contest and get right to stuffing our faces...\" Ed mumbled, slightly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, his cocky, dismissive demeanor vanishing, did the same. \"Y-yeah, that might be a good idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharing a laugh at their embarrassment, both \"contestants\" focused their attention on the table. \"Hunter, can ya give the word?\" Kurama asked, eying up a pile of doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh?\" The anthro started. \"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, he raised his paw up in the air. \"Three...two...one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paw cut down through the air. \"GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ed and Kurama fell upon the goodies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Al watched with a deadpanned expression to his fiery eyes as both his older brother and the young tailed beast had ravenously begun to tear into the goodies on the table like there was no tomorrow.  As he watched, however, he couldn't help but note just how much faster Kurama was managing to pace himself.  The young fox was scarfing down several doughnuts at a time, chowing down voraciously and promptly gulping them down before stuffing even more right back in.  Hunter, meanwhile, having seen what both were capable of; specifically Kurama, simply grinned eagerly as he watched the two go at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ed was still working on a pile of doughnuts that he too had his eyes on, Kurama had already blazed through the one pile he initially had his eyes on, and was now grabbing a hand-pawful of brownies in each hand and scarfing them down a few at a time.  Catching this, Ed almost sputtered, but nonetheless, forced himself to eat faster.  The teenaged alchemist was now plowing his way through the remains of his doughnuts, and now focused his attention on a chocolate cake that was positively lathered in milk chocolate frosting and vanilla frosting in the shape of the Fairy Tail Guild Mark atop the cake.  Competitive as he was, even Ed had to stop and marvel at the rich flavor looming from the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-holy crap!\" muttered Ed as he gulped down a massive mouthful of the cake.  \"Seriously, Kurama, this is better than store bought bakery cake!  The GOOD kinda bakery too!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama beamed proudly at the elder Elric brother, even as he was continuing to stuff his maw with as much goodies as he could cram down it.  \"Heh, thanks!  Glad y'er enjoying it so much!\"  Even in competition, Kurama wasn't one not to be gracious.  Though, that remark was about all he'd afford as he resumed stuffing his craw instantaneously, much to Ed's frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, the sheer rate in which the young fox was scarfing down treats was already having an effect.  Ed glanced across the table, and past the vast array of sweets and baked goods, he could see the young tailed beasts' stomach had been so packed, that it was already beginning to protrude through his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kurama wasn't even aware of how drastically the sweet baked delights had already impacted his midsection.  He was simply enjoying the food too much.  Al on the other hand, would be gaping if he still had a mouth.  Which certainly wasn't lost on the anthro wolf next to him, who saw the expression across the metallic helmet and chuckled softly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speedy lil bugger, ain't he,\" remarked Hunter with no small amount of pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You can say that again,\" replied Al, still dumbfounded.  \"How on earth does someone even THAT much, THAT fast...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Hunter laughed, rubbing the back of his head as he said, \"Hehe, weeeeeell, the kid IS largely pure energy afterall.  Only makes sense that he'd be able to put so much more away at that rate than the average person, right?\"  Hunter turned his attention back to Kurama, smiled, then added, \"Plus...well, in his 'early years', we all spent a LOT of time stuffin' our faces again and again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" asked Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft, why <i>not?</i>\" answered Hunter, earning a roll of Al's fiery eyes.  \"We just had tons of fun together, and tons of fun eating as much as our guts possibly could, hehe.  Don't need much more reason than that.  And after Kurama ended up with Natsu and the Guild up in Fiore, hehe, let's just say ol' Salamander managed to really light a 'spark' to the kids' competitive side...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd almost be a wonder how he stays so thin...but I suppose being 'mostly pure energy' has a hand in that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, plus he leads an incredibly physically active lifestyle.  Least, that's what his job demands most of the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl nodded to that, then chuckled despite himself.  \"We can certainly relate to that.  Which...<i>might</i> have a hand in just why Edward's tummy hasn't ballooned to the point where I'm rolling him across Central...<i>yet</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter snickered at that, though in the back of his head, he felt for Al.  It was one thing to often be embarrassed by the overeating antics of his brother.  But to watch two individuals stuffing their faces with as much deliciousness as their bellies could handle...knowing Al himself couldn't eat a bite or know that kind of satisfaction...it had to be difficult...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And it was something Hunter; if at least for the briefest of moments, hoped to change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ed, determined not to be shown up so quickly by Kurama, began stuffing his maw to the points where his cheeks bulged comically, before he'd ravenously chomp down on the baked goods in his maw and; with a hearty gulp, send a large mouthful down his throat with a more than noticeable bulge that traveled down his throat, sinking into his chest and down into his stomach, causing it to slowly but surely expand with every few gulps.  Much to his delight, this comical and utterly ridiculous display had given him the opportunity to catch up with Kurama, who was still just too rapt by the flavors of his own baked goods to even notice how far either he nor Ed had gone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmacking his chops, Kurama soon turned his attention to a strawberry milkshake.  He grabbed the pitcher with one hand and promptly brought it up to his maw, gulping down a good fifth of it in one go before setting it back down, licking his lips and beaming.  \"Mmm, that's almost as rich and creamy as the ones Elfman made!\" Kurama muttered to himself with pride, before digging right back in.  Not one to be shown up, Ed; having gulped down a doughnut whole and needing to thump his chest a few times to get it down, gasped, turned his attention to a vanilla milkshake before him, and promptly began chugging it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl watched this and rolls his eyes as he noted, \"...He won't so much as LOOK at milk, but mix it with ice cream and he can't get enough...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled and added, \"Hey, who knows?  Maybe if ya slip in some extra milk to his ice cream every once in a while, he might actually end up being taller than a six year old...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Al snickered at this, watching Ed chug and chug, which caused his belly to slowly but surely expand and expand, and in doing so...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, Ed's eyes snapped wide open. Lowering the shake, he groaned, wiping his mouth with his sleeve as he did so. \"Urgh...mighta gone a little too fast...\" Groaning again, he leaned back in his seat, resting his hands on his swelling tummy and gently rubbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, noticing this, set down the danish he was tearing through and glanced at Ed. \"Ed? Are you...are you feeling OK?\" the young fox asked, worry evident in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd cracked open an eye and smirked weakly. \"Y-yeah, I'm fine. Just, uh, a little overpacked is all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked. \"Well, that and the fact that you're horking down those goodies like there's no tomorrow is probably a factor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl, on the other hand, groaned. \"I just KNEW this was going to happen...Brother, you really need to pace yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd sat up a bit, glancing over at Al. \"WEll, what am I supposed to do, eat slow? It's a competition, Al! Besides,\" he added, winking at Kurama, \"with food THIS good, it's hard NOT to cram as much in as I can!\"  Kurama beamed at the praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, thanks, Ed!\" Kurama exclaimed, touched. He frowned as Ed once again winced in discomfort. \"Still, since your gut's hurting right now, why don't we put the contest on hold till you're feeling a little better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's eyes widened at this as he looked across the table. \"What, you don't wanna just keep eating while I rest it off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama shook his head. \"Hey, it's no fun if both of us aren't on our A-game; I want ya to give it the best you've got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd blinked, surprised at Kurama's graciousness. Hunter, already well used to this, simply sent a warm smile the young creature's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl, though he was also surprised, nonetheless added, \"Brother, I think it'd be a good idea if you rested for a bit; these goodies aren't going anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing a bit, Ed sat up. \"Alright, alright, we'll take a break. Twist my arm, why don'tcha...\" Kurama only giggled at this, as the two lapsed into companionable silence as they relaxed, marveling at how much their stomachs had already bulged. Ed's belly had swollen a bit more noticeably, with a tiny bit of flesh peeking out from under his shirt. Kurama, though his stomach was still concealed beneath his shirt, appeared as though he'd swallowed a melon whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Al broke the silence. \"You know, Hunter...\" he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter glanced up at him. \"Hmm? Yeah, Al?\" he replied curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl rubbed the back of his head. \"If you don't mind me asking...what exactly ARE you? I mean, you're not a Chimera, and you're not a being of pure energy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chakra,\" Kurama piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...chakra,\" Al amended, laughing a bit at the young fox. \"So, I hafta ask...what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Ed looked over at them. \"Ya know, I'm a little curious about that myself....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled. \"Ah, now THAT'S something I don't get to explain often...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's hand shot up. \"Ooh! Hunter! Can I tell it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head and laughing a bit, Hunter indicated the young Tailed Beast. \"Sure thing, Kurama; you always manage to tell it good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama gave a wide, toothy grin at this. Then, shifting his chair so he could easily look at Ed and Al, he began speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter comes from a world that's pretty mundane on the surface,\" he began. \"Yeah, they've got pretty advanced tech, but a lotta people think stuff like magic, ghosts, and the supernatural are just fairy tales.\" He giggled a bit at his little pun before going on. \"But see, if you're willing to keep an open mind and consider every possibility...you'll find more than you've ever imagined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured at Hunter. \"He's part of the 'more'. Hunter comes from a race of anthropomorphic canines that have existed almost as long as the humans of his world have. No alien intervention, no experimentation, no dimensional travel...\" He winked at the wolf. \"Nope, it's their home just as much as this world is your guys'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama paused to gather his thoughts, while the brothers stared at him, not quite sure what to make of this revelation. Hunter took this opportunity to add, \"It's not just wolves either; dogs, coyotes, dholes...if it's a canine, there are gonna be anthro versions of them.\" He smirked and jabbed a thumb at himself. \"The wolf's just one of many subspecies of canine anthro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding at this, Kurama went on with his tale. \"They were always very sociable, with both each other AND humans. In fact, in the early, early years of his world's existence, they often co-existed, living alongside and helping one another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty eloquent for a kid, huh?\", Al repeated to Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter chuckled. \"Kid likes to read.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a bit, Kurama went on. \"So yeah, everything was fine at first...\" His expression fell. \"But as with any race, there are always gonna be a few bad apples. Those bad apples got into some bad situations with humans, and, well...people started to fear them.\" He winced, the story hitting too close to home for him. \"People started creating legends and myths about them, like werewolves. Hunter's...people...tried running damage control; interacting with people, helping where they could...but the damage was done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama winced again, but still went on. \"Things got worse and worse for years, until one of them went crazy and started killing humans left and right...\" Ed and Al's eyes widened at this, and even Hunter shut his eyes and looked to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-they called it 'The Beast of Gevaudan', 'cause that's the name of the place where it attacked,\" Kurama explained, face dropping when he saw Hunter's expression. \"And, well...after that, Hunter's people saw which way the wind was blowing, and they basically scattered. I mean,\" Kurama added quickly, \"they're still plentiful; they've just spread so far across his world you'd be lucky to meet even one during your lifetime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd and Al's eyes widened. The story sounded incredible, outlandish, even ridiculous...but at the stone-cold sober expression on Hunter's face, they realized it was the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lotta places to hide on my world,\" Hunter picked up, opening his eyes and looking at the two brothers. \"Undeveloped forests and woods, mountains, caves...you name it, we found it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl's eyes widened. \"Didn't...didn't your people ever try to re-integrate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded. \"They did, centuries ago...but then the witch hunts went down, and they decided not to bother; not if it meant getting burned at the stake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, never having heard this part, widened his eyes. \"B-burned at the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shook his head. \"Trust, me, you don't wanna know. Don't worry,\"he added when he saw the look on Ed and Kurama's faces. \"We haven't completely severed human contact. For those of us who live in the woods, we often do business with folks coming through. They usually go well...but we have to make sure they don't tell anybody about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do that?\" Al asked, not sure he wanted to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned evilly. \"We threaten to rip their throats out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Ed, Kurama, and somehow Al's faces went white. Hunter blinked dully for a moment...then burst out laughing. \"Oh, c'mon, we'd never do anything like that! Sure, we THREATEN to, but we'd never actually follow through on it.\" He lifted up the side of his muzzle to expose his rather sharp teeth. \"Usually, all it takes is a look at these to ensure mum's the word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still,\" Al added faintly, \"ripping throats out...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirked. \"Hey, it gets the job done, don't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing his throat, he went on.\"Anyway, even living as families, we're still very social, and still really in-touch with one another...\" The wolf smiled fondly. \"My mom and dad...they're the best parents anyone could ask for, and I had a great puphood thanks to them.\" <i>I definitely need to visit sometime....it's been too long,</i> the wolf mused internally. \"Anyway, their names are Sage-she's my mom-and Garwood, Gar for short-my dad. So if you're ever in my world...\" he winked. \"Look 'em up.\" He nodded to Kurama to finish the tale, and the young Tailed Beast was only too happy to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah, THAT'S where Hunter comes from, and THAT'S what he is. Still,\" he added, his voice turning warm, \"that's not NEARLY as important as WHO he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled softly. \"And what would that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama beamed and held up a fist. \"My friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his heart hitch, Hunter nonetheless managed a smirk. He strode over to Kurama, held his own fist up, and returned the fox's fist bump. \"Aww, thanks, fuzzball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd and Al only watched, gaping...though Ed could have sworn he felt something melting inside his chest....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing his brother's discomfort (though he couldn't deny that his armored chest felt oddly soft), Al cleared his throat. \"S-so! Erm, you feeling better, brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Ed got a thoughtful look on his face....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think a lil waiting was juuuuuust what I needed...\"  Ed replied, giving his belly a few eager pats,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, of course, beamed eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, waiting felt like it was gonna be an eternity...\" the young fox joked, much to Ed's amusement.  \"...Now that'cher gut's not hurting anymore...ready to try'n fill it up with more goodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning slyly right back, Ed gave young Kurama a wink and said, \"MORE than ready...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without another word uttered, both Ed and Kurama dove right back in, scarfing down various baked goods and chewing voraciously as their cheeks filled to the near comical brim with pastries.  Al, meanwhile, watching from the sidelines, simply chuckled softly and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lengths brother will go through just to stuff himself with as much food as possible...\" the younger alchemist remarked, much to Hunter's amusement.  \"Hey, to be fair, when it comes to the fuzzball's baking, no lengths are too great.  I swear, if I took this kid to this other realm I frequent, he'd kick so much ass at 'Cupcake Wars.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Al's fiery red eyes seemed to blink dully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...'Cupcake...Wars'...?  People have wars over cupcakes...?  Or have these people learned to weaponize cupcakes somehow...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Hunter cracked up and waved his paw dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, it's nothin' malicious or violent.  It's...hmmm...think of it as...ANOTHER contest.  Only, instead of stuffing their faces with cupcakes, the contestants are trying their best to make the best looking and best tasting cupcakes for the judges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so it's a bake-off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A more extreme and dramatic one, but yeah, more or less.  I've debated taking Kurama to this realm a few times, since he has the means to look human after all.  Buuuuut something tells me this particular realm might be a bit too...erm, adult oriented.  So, maybe when he's older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Hunter,\" Al began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?  What's up, Al?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These realms you speak of...how often do you traverse them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, as often as I can.  I mean, it's not a realm a minute or anything like that, y'know?  But I like seeing new places, and meeting new people especially.  Part of what keeps me from just realm jumping again and again are all the cool faces I come across, present company included.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ed and Kurama were too busy scarfing down more and more pastries to hear, Al chuckled softly and rubbed the back of his metallic 'head.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice of you to say, but still, doesn't it ever get dangerous?\" asked Al, to which, Hunter nodded and rubbed the back of his head almost uneasily.  \"...And THEN some...\" he said in a smaller voice, before perking back up and adding, \"but the risks are worth it, I say.  If I didn't take those risks, I'd have never met some of my best friends...\"  Hunter then glanced over at Kurama, watching the young pre-teen fox stuffing his muzzle with as many of his own pastries as he could manage, and smiled warmly as he added, \"...including the fuzzball over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid 'fuzzball', meanwhile, had just gulped down a heaping mouthful of danishes and licked his chops clean before pulling an armful of doughnuts his way, and promptly snatched them up, pulled them to his maw, and began taking sharp chomps out of each one, face beaming with each delightful bite.  \"Mmmm, man, I almost forgot how perfect Elfman's Vanilla Glaze recipe tastes on these bad boys!\" beamed the young fox, before chomping down on more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd, on the other hand, had just polished off a plate full of cookies and was now working on a cherry pie.  Tearing a huge chunk out, the teen opened his own mouth nice and wide and shoved about half of his slice into his eager maw before chomping down and chewing voraciously.  Taking a hearty gulp, he sighed and shoveled the rest of the 'slice' right back in, smearing cherry sauce all over his lips, much to Hunter's amusement, and Al's bemusement.  The FullMetal Alchemist then wiped his mouth clean and licked the cherry and crust residue from his lips, before grabbing another slice from the pie and doing the exact same thing, earning the same cherry smeared result within bites.  Al simply shook his head at his older brothers uncouth eating habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, brother, where are your manners...?\" scolded the younger suit of armor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which, Ed grinned impishly at his younger brother and said, \"Dunno, but wherever they are, I hope they can hear this...\"  And to emphasize what 'this' meant, the elder Elric took his automail fist and thumped it against his chest a few times, causing Ed to let out a HUGE belch, much to Al's embarrassment, while Hunter and Kurama snickered with amusement at the boorish display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, good one, Ed,\" Kurama remarked between his snickers, holding his fist towards Ed, who smacked his chops, smirked at the young kyuubi, and bumped his fist right back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, heh, was kinda waiting on that one for a while actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl simply sighed and hung his head into his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm surrounded...\" he murmured to himself, earning a pat on the 'back' by Hunter.  \"Yep!  Ya suuuuure are!\" he said jokingly, which only exasperated Al's sigh.  While Al facepalmed though, Ed and Kurama once again resumed voraciously wolfing down more sweets.  Polishing off his doughnuts with gusto, the young fox licked his chops clean, and followed Ed's example, grabbing a still fresh apple pie from the table, ripping out a huge chunk designated a 'slice', aaaaand just like Ed, shoved it messily right into his maw, wasting no time chewing and gulping before repeating the same motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more time passed, both Ed and Kurama's tummies continued to steadily swell up.  Ed's T-Shirt hiked up a little more and more to the point where the bottom was resting just below Ed's belly button.  And Kurama had finally consumed enough for his own shirt to hike up enough to expose some orange fur from his belly.  But neither one showed any signs of slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more time passed...</span></div></div>",

Donuts, cakes, pastries, milkshakes, pies...it was all grabbed, savored, and devoured, with no notable end in sight. Hunter and Al continued watching, the wolf with a wide, amused grin, and Al with a growing sense of resignation (and a growing desire to massage his temples, even if it wouldn't have really done anything.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, this caused their stomachs to swell up further and further; Kurama's shirt continued pulling upwards, exposing more of his orange-furred belly. Ed's shirt, on the other hand, pulled up to reveal his navel, and slowly continued hiking up. All the while, their pants slowly but surely grew tighter. And yet, neither one let up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...at least, until Ed drew a pie towards him, took a bite...and widened his eyes. \"Kurama,\" he began slowly, the forkful still in his mouth, \"What kinda pie is this...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Kurama mumbled through a mouthful of cake. Gulping it down, he looked toward Ed. \"Oh, that?\" He laughed, rubbing the back of his head. \"It's a butterscotch-cinnamon pie; this is my first time making it, so if its a little dry or under-baked, sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's eyes widened, even as he gulped down the pie. \"Are you kidding?\" he exclaimed. \"This pie tastes awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama tilted his head, ears twitching a bit. \"Really...?\" he asked, unable to keep his surprise and gratitude completely out of his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd grinned, ripping out a huge forkful and cramming it into his mouth. \"You bet!\" the young alchemist exclaimed eagerly (\"Brother, swallow before you talk,\" Al murmured in exasperation). \"It's sweet, thick, rich...\" he chewed a bit more before gulping it down and getting to work on an even BIGGER forkful. \"Can't believe I've never had one of these before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a bit, Kurama scratched his cheek. \"H-heh, well, don't be TOO impressed; you can take it from me, it's nowhere near as good as Toriel's pies....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smirked. \"Well, I've never had her pies, so I wouldn't....\" he trailed off as Kurama's statement fully clicked. \"Wait...Toriel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama nodded. \"Yep; she's a sorta goat-monster Hunter and me met a while back.\" Hunter grinned and nodded, but Ed and Al only looked even more confused. \"...monster?\" Al asked faintly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shook his head. \"N-naw, it's nothing bad or anything; in her world \"Monster\" is just a catch-all term for a variety of strange creatures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama nodded eagerly. \"Yep, and they're no more malicious than anybody else. I mean, they have homes, jobs, families, just like anybody else....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter perked up. \"And speaking of family...she also has a son, and he's probably THE sweetest, kindest....CUTEST little fella you'd ever have the pleasure of meeting,\" he exclaimed, face lighting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what about me?\" Kurama protested playfully, putting on his best mock-annoyed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf smirked. \"OK, OK, SECOND sweetest, kindest, cutest little fella you'd ever have the pleasure of meeting,\" he amended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama giggled. \"Heh heh, thanks. But you're right, he's one of the nicest people I've ever met...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kurama sagged a bit. \u201cPoor guy didn\u2019t deserve to go through what he did\u2026\u201d he muttered under his breath. Hunter\u2019s ears twitched, and he nodded sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Kurama hadn\u2019t spoken as quietly as he thought he had, and Ed and Al looked at him, curious. \u201cWhat he went through?\u201d Ed asked. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Kurama shared a glance, the wolf gave the young Nine-Tails a nod. Nodding in return, Kurama returned his attention to Ed and Al. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he scratched the back of his head, trying to figure out how to begin. \u201cIt\u2019s a really long story, and I don\u2019t know if I wanna go into exact detail, but\u2026\u201d He took a breath. \u201cA long time ago, he befriended and trusted the wrong person\u2026and he died because of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That</i> caught Ed and Al\u2019s attention. \u201cHe\u2026he <i>died?!</i>\u201d Al exclaimed, fiery eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama nodded, bowing his head a bit. \u201cYeah, and what\u2019s worse, monsters in that world turn to dust when they die. His parents\u2026\u201d He felt tears pricking his eyes, but he continued on. \u201c\u2026his parents saw him turn to dust right in front of their eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd gaped. \u201cWha---seriously?!\u201d Kurama nodded again, and the young alchemist grit his teeth. Losing Nina had been hard enough, but if they had actually <i>seen</i>\u2026he shook his head vigorously; that train of thought <i>always</i> led to places he didn\u2019t want to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox carried on. \u201cLater on, he was accidentally restored to life\u2026but it was as a flower, and without a soul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd before you say that people don\u2019t come back from the dead,\u201d Hunter cut in, when it looked like Ed was about to interject, \u201cThat\u2019s  a different world, with different natural laws,\u201d his eyes narrowed, \u201cand the same rules don\u2019t apply.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth brothers fell silent at this, slightly taken aback; the wolf\u2019s voice and expression were intense, and brooked no room for argument. A far cry from the easygoing, friendly wolf they\u2019d begun to know, to be sure\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To be stripped even of that\u2026it didn\u2019t bear thinking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEventually,\u201d Kurama continued, \u201che absorbed enough souls to regain his true form, but he quickly transformed into an older, stronger version of himself. He aimed to gain complete control of his world\u2019s timelines, but Frisk-a human kid who\u2019d stumbled into the monsters\u2019 underground world by mistake-faced and fought him, and eventually managed to bring him to his senses. He once again assumed his true form. He released all the souls he\u2019d absorbed\u2026but that once again left him without a soul, and it was only a matter of time before he became a flower again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, and Ed took this moment to interject. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d he began, noticeably upset. \u201cAfter all that\u2026the poor kid still\u2026?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait \u2018till he\u2019s finished telling it,\u201d Hunter informed him calmly\u2026though there was a hint of a smile tugging at his muzzle. Ed glanced at the wolf, once again taken aback by his directness, but nonetheless complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving Hunter a small smile, Kurama continued on. \u201cSome time after that, Hunter and I met Asriel in a\u2026special place, which I\u2019ll tell you about later.\u201d He smiled warmly. \u201cWe hit it off pretty quick; he was pretty nervous and shy at first-understandably, of course-but it wasn\u2019t long before we were all playing together, exploring\u2026and hanging out as friends. And\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile faded a bit. \u201c\u2026when je told us about what he\u2019d been through\u2026what was going to happen to him once he left that special place\u2026\u201d Kurama\u2019s smile faded further. \u201c\u2026we both knew we couldn\u2019t let that happen to him, not after everything he\u2019d been through. And me\u2026 I was still just a kit then, but I promised him I\u2019d find a way to help him, no matter how long it took. And a few years later, in my world\u2019s time\u2026I was ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled a bit. \u201cLuckily, some worlds run on different laws of time than others, so what was a few years for me was only a couple months in Asriel\u2019s world. Anyway,\u201d he continued, the smile beginning to return to his face. \u201cOnce I was ready, I got one of Hunter\u2019s friends to take me to Asriel\u2019s world, and I tracked down Frisk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe kid who fought him?\u201d Al asked, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama grinned. \u201cThe very same. As it turned out, he wasn\u2019t any happier about leaving Asriel to his fate than we were, and he\u2019d been trying to figure out a way to save him\u2026but nothing he tried worked. So I told him who I was, and that I had an idea about how to save him. We both traveled to the mountain that served as the entrance to the monsters\u2019 former home, and we found Asriel. It\u2026wasn\u2019t easy when we did,\u201d he admitted with a pained look on his face, evidently not wanting to go into further detail than that, \u201cbut once we brought Asriel back to his senses\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to butt in, fuzzball,\u201d Hunter suddenly spoke, \u201cbut can I take over from here?\u201d He grinned widely, showing his sharp teeth. \u201cI\u2019m just so damn proud of what you came up with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blinked, a bit surprised, but nonetheless smiled and nodded. \u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving the fox a thumbs-up, Hunter turned his attention to Ed and Al. \u201cOnce they got Asriel calmed down, Frisk was able to give a piece of his soul to Asriel, and Kurama gave some of his chakra to supplement and strengthen it. It was touch and go for a bit, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm smile came to the wolf\u2019s muzzle. \u201c\u2026it ended up working like a damn charm. The kid had a soul of his own again, and he could go back home to his family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smiled just as warmly, even as tears once again pricked his eyes\u2026albeit for a very different reason. \u201cI stayed out of sight when Frisk and Asriel got back home, so I didn\u2019t intrude\u2026but I saw everything. And when Asriel\u2019s parents saw him, alive and well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes, a couple tears running down his cheeks as he remembered Asriel\u2019s parents crying tear of pure disbelief and joy and embracing their son. \u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think words would do it justice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd and Al stared at him, lost for words. Finally, Al said, \u201cYou\u2026you really did all that for him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama opened his eyes and looked at Al, a few tears still dripping. \u201cOf course I did; I promised him, didn\u2019t I? Besides,\u201d he added, wiping his eyes on his sleeve, \u201cit wasn\u2019t <i>all</i> me; Frisk gave a part of his soul, too, even though we didn\u2019t know what would happen\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh,\u201d Hunter laughed good-naturedly. \u201cI think you\u2019re selling yourself short; if it weren\u2019t for you, you two wouldn\u2019t have been able to devise that plan, and Asriel would still be suffering\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama shrugged. \u201cY-yeah, I guess that\u2019s true\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, he winced. <i>Still,</i> he wondered guiltily, <i>would he still be so happy and proud if he knew I gave Asriel more than just my chakra\u2026?</i><br>\r\nHe hated keeping secrets from Hunter, especially after all the anthro had helped do for him\u2026but he knew how Hunter would react if he told him the whole truth. <i>But he deserves the truth,</i> Kurama thought, not for the first time. <i>Before we leave Ed and Al\u2019s world, I\u2019ll tell him\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKurama? You still with us, pal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama snapped to attention. \u201cE-eh?\u201d He looked toward Hunter, who was regarding him with an amused yet somewhat curious look. \u201cO-oh yeah; just kinda got overwhelmed thinking about it.\u201d He smiled at Hunter. \u201cI\u2019m fine, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter flashed Kurama a grin, then turned his attention back to Ed and Al. \u201cAnyhow, Asriel\u2019s living a happy life now, with his friends and family. We check up on him every now and again, and we\u2019re never disappointed with how he\u2019s doing.\u201d He brightened. \u201cI see a lotta great things in his future\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and his friends and family will be there to help him, every step of the way,\" Kurama finished, smiling warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd and Al were silent once again, trying to decide how or even if they should respond to that. It was all so much to take in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Kurama spoke up again. \"After all, if you have people you love by your side, what <i>can't</i> you do?\" To punctuate this, he drew another pie towards him and took a bite, beaming happily. Seeing that Ed and Al were still lost for words, though, he smirked as an idea came to him. \"Just like how, with Hunter here, I'm totally gonna eat more than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat snapped the brothers out of their stupor. \"N-not if I'm eating with Al here!\" Ed sputtered, causing the animated suit of armor to groan a bit and facepalm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama's eyes gleamed. \"Bring it on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, with that, fox and alchemist were at it once again, shoveling as many goodies as they good down their gullets, and their midsections slowly expanding as a result with Hunter and Kurama watching on....</span></div></div>",

But neither one was going to stop there, so both Edward and Kurama grabbed the nearest pie by either ones vicinity and; without so much as even taking a slice out to at least eat cleaner, both just stabbed their forks down, and practically began shoveling the baked goods into their eager maws.  It was liking watching a blur of pure high speed motion...on fast forward while their pies slowly diminished.  Though, in this case, one may imagine 'slowly' being used rather loosely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter just smirked at the sight and lightly nudged the large animated suit of armor with his elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, so, any bets on who ya think is gonna come out on top?\"  the wolf inquired, to which, Alphonse simply sighed and replied with, \"At this rate, I can envision some pretty bad tummyaches for both of them.  Edward already had to take a break earlier on after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Hunter snickered and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, Al, you saw how Ed managed at the contest.  And, not to gush or anything, that lil orange fuzzball puts it away like no one's business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't see why they can't just enjoy their meals like ordinary people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd naturally, Hunter began snickering as the answer was just too perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehe, yeaaaah could be cause neither one of these two are the least bit normal, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, naturally, earned yet another sigh and a shake of the metallic head from the younger Elric brother.  Still laughing, Hunter just playfully patted the suit of armor on the back and said, \"Ah, c'mon, these two're smart enough to pace themselves a lil bit.  But so long as they're having fun, that's what matters most, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed, for all the competition brewing between Ed and Kurama, both; even with the competitive glint in their eyes, couldn't help but occasionally beam at the flavor of their respective dishes.  As for their steadily swelling stomachs, that was another matter entirely.  Watching the scene, Hunter couldn't help but reflect back on a few things, which caused his smile to soften a bit, which; naturally, Alphonse caught wind of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright, Hunter?\" asked Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back at the suit of armor, Hunter flashed a grin and said, \"Oh, y-yeah, heh, I'm cool.  It's just...h-heh, this, and everything Kurama was talking about, it kinda reminds me of the time we first spent with Asriel.  Hehe, I swear, for such a reserved, gentle creature, I tell ya, that kid could REALLY pack it away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd naturally, this drew Alphonse's attention as well as he asked, \"...Wait a minute, you mean, even Asriel-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Ate til he looked like his gut was the size of a friggin' medicine ball?  Yyyyyyep.  And you better believe he can still pack it away to this day now that he's got his soul and body back.  It's funny because, at first, the kid didn't want to eat a whole lot.  H-heh, we kinda egged him on, but eventually, he came around, and man oh man did he put us to shame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphonse simply sighed and shook his head.  \"Is there anyone out there who DOESN'T eat like it's the end of the world?\"  Which earned a hearty laugh from the wolf as he shook his head and replied with, \"Ah, haha, I hope not, pal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger Elric sighed again, but eventually chuckled a bit himself, thinking vacantly himself.  \"Well...I'm just glad he got a happy ending in the end.  I mean, to imagine one could endure so much...be dealt such a horrid hand in life...and still end up just...lost...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah, I hear ya, Al, more than you can imagine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But for Kurama to go through such lengths to save him, with his friend, Frisk...h-he...he's a good guy...a truly good one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter glanced back at the young fox, who was shoveling yet another whole pie vigorously into his maw, and despite himself, Hunter smiled a warm, proud smile at the Tailed Beast, nodding ever so slightly.  \"...He truly is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Al just watched as both his older brother and new fox friend consumed and consumed....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...The pans began to pile up as one pie after another was demolished without hesitation.  And all the while, both their bellies steadily swelled up little by little.  Even Ed had to admit, he was impressed by Kurama's relentless speed.  After all, when they began, Ed had already eaten considerably more than the young fox, yet, here the two were, on the same level with no stops in sight.  And to cap it off, after hearing his tragic story about their friend, Asriel, he only grew to respect Kurama more and more.  Still, for as much as he grew to like the young, orange furred fox, he wasn't about to lose anytime soon.  So, he soldiered on, stuffing more and more various pies into his maw, barely stopping to chew for more than half a second or two with each gulp.  But those brief moments were all he ever needed to truly find himself rapt by the sheer wonderful flavor bursting with each bite.  Which, of course, only encouraged the young alchemist to chow down further as his belly swelled up just a bit more with every few mouthfuls wolfed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until Ed's rather bloated stomach let out a DEEP gurgle that he was forced to stop for a moment, which caught Al's attention almost immediately as he glanced at his older brother with slight but still fairly noticeable concern and immediately asked, \"Erm, Brother...?  Are you okay...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, upon hearing that, Kurama gulped down his current mouthful and glanced back at the grimacing elder Elric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, are you still feeling up to it, Ed?  Because, we can take another break if you need us to for any reason, really.\" remarked young Kurama...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd didn't want to keep slowing down whenever his bloated belly seemingly reached another apex.  After all, that would start to look pathetic, in his mind.  But, on the other hand, he really didn't want to...'lose his lunch' either, as that would be a less than pretty sight, and would, no doubt, put a hamper on the whole outing...not to mention, prove Al right, which Ed did NOT want to do...at least, not in regards to stuffing his face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with an even deeper gurgle, Edward Elric had his answer...</span></div></div>",

Everything Hunter had mentioned below and then some, was just sprawled on a large table, practically begging to be consumed.  Hunter, seeing Ed in his near trance-like state, practically drooling, simply laughed and said, \"Bon appetit, Mr. Elric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl, upon reaching the sight, couldn't help but be impressed, as he turned to Hunter and asked, \"Wow, you prepared ALL of this for Brother...?\"  Hunter smiled proudly and said, \"Like I said, nothing but the finest.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd slowly approached the table, still gaping in dumbfounded awe at the feast to be.  Sitting down, he just examined all the goodies around him, unable to decide where to start, until his stomach roared impatiently.  Scowling a bit, he glanced down at it and said, \"Alright already, sheesh!\"  He pulled a brownie out of a bowl of vanilla ice cream, then took a nice, big bite.  After chewing for a moment, he stopped as his eyes lit up.  In no time at all, he immediately wolfed down the brownie in his hand, and wasted no time ripping into another, then another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling widely, the young alchemist proceeded to grab a spoon, and lather his next brownie with even more vanilla ice cream on top, then took a gaping bite, enjoying the burst of chilled and warm flavors mixed together.  \"Mmmm!  Oh man, this stuff tastes incredible!\" Ed exclaimed, before smothering the rest of his brownie with more ice cream and stuffing the whole thing into his mouth, enjoying the plethora of flavors surging from the pastry, ice cream combination, but only momentarily before reaching for another hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Al and Hunter watched as Ed was reaching for whatever he could and immediately stuffing it straight into his more than eager mouth.  Gulping down a mouthful of various delights, Ed sighed happily and said, \"I'm tellin' ya, Al, the SECOND you get your body back, we're gonna get all the smooth, warm brownies and ice cream money can buy!  I can't believe we never tried combining the two before!\"  Al simply smirked, only half paying attention to his older brother.  However, he hadn't forgotten what Hunter had said to him downstairs, and decided to address Hunter on that issue before any more distractions could arise and interrupt him yet again.  \"Say, Hunter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf immediately turned to the large suit of animated armor.  \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what you said downstairs,\" Al stopped for a moment, gathering his thoughts as his tone grew a tad more serious.  \"Exactly what do you know about what Brother and I have been through in our lives...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that?\"  Hunter proceeded to rub the back of his head as he went on.  \"Well, see, another thing about me is that I can get access to a considerable amount of information on people, courtesy of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Hunter and Al; slightly annoyed at being interrupted yet again, turned to Ed, who was in the process of digging into a layer cake.  \"I just wanna say...thanks for all this.  I know we didn't exactly get off on the right foot, with the height thing and the whole me wanting to bash your face in for the height thing...but this right here?\" he said, gesturing towards the table of food and the slice of cake still in his hand, \"...I don't care if it IS just all to get a laugh outta watching me eat myself silly, this goes BEYOND awesome.  Soooo...thanks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled, tail wagging as he said, \"Happy to serve, Mr. Elric.\"  Chuckling a bit, Ed added, \"Do me a favor, just call me Ed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Ed.  Hope you enjoy!\"  He then turned his attention back to Al and said, \"But yeah, like I was telling you, back where I come from, see, I have-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, come to think of it,\" Ed added, earning an annoying groan from Al as he facepalmed immediately after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more than enough stuff here to go around, y'know?  Much as I wouldn't mind eating every last drop of it, I've always enjoyed eating with company, and since Al can't eat anything, how would you like to get in on this, Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter thought for a moment while Al fought the urge to shout angrily for answers as best he could...</span></div></div>",

Hunter, in turn, looked towards Al; knowing exactly what was bothering him, he winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd blinked, confused. \"Al, what's the deal? I know you're not crazy about me stuffing myself, but it's not like I'm gonna back out in public once I'm done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl shook his head. \"No, Brother, it's not that.\" He looked towards Hunter more than a mite suspiciously. \"While you were changing, Hunter was talking about how, considering what we've been threw, it was only fair to throw us a bone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's eyes widened. \"How would he know anything about us?\" He looked at Hunter, his eyes narrowing. \"What aren't you telling us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sighed, rubbing the back of his head. \"Ah geez...\" He looked apologetically towards Al. \"I was gonna tell Al anyway, but since you're both here, I might as well tell both of you.\" Taking a deep breath, he composed himself as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Generally, whenever I'm following someone, I make it a point to know as much about them as I can. To that end, before I even came here, I had some...acquaintances run some recon on you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl tilted his head. \"What kind of 'acquaintances'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged. \"The kinds of acquaintances that know how to avoid being seen and are <i>very</i> thorough in their investigations.\" Before Ed and Al could inquire further, Hunter hastily continued. \"Anyway, after they got back to me with the info they dug up...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the brothers' shock, he actually winced, looking somewhat pained. \"I gotta say, I was shocked to hear what a raw deal you guys got. I mean, losing your mom at such a young age, losing parts of your bodies...can't imagine what that was like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's shoulders slumped, his eyes downcast. \"Y-yeah...\" he muttered, notably pained att the mention of his and Al's past trauma. The younger Elric said something, but he clenched his fists, trembling a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter winced again, immediately regretting bringing up those events, but he went on. \"A-anyway, it's no secret the following years weren't exactly a picnic for either of you...\" An image of a little, bright-eyed brunette girl came to the minds of both brothers, and they fought back the memory. \"...and I know trying to get your bodies back has been an uphill battle since then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled a bit. \"I know you've no shortage of friends to help and support you, but I figured, what could it hurt to make make things a bit easier on ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd and Al gaped at the wolf; there was still the tiniest chance he was jerking them around, but he seemed so <i>sincere</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd was the first to speak up. \"You're...you're really doing all this just 'cause you wanted to be nice<br>\r\nto us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shrugged. \"Well, part of it is just 'cause I like watching guys like you stuff themselves, but yeah, that was a big part of it.\" He paused for a moment. \"So...you guys mad? I mean, you've got every right to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl thought for a moment. \"Well, I'm not too happy you invaded our privacy, but if you're really doing all this just because of what we went through...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...well, I guess we can't be TOO mad,\" Ed finished, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter grinned. \"That's great to hear...\" he looked towards Al. \"...and don't worry, Al's secret is safe with me.\" He licked his chops. \"Now, what was that you were saying about eating those goodies with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd grinned, motioning to the table. \"Yep! More than enough here for two of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's tail wagged happily as he made his way over to the table, pulled a chair over, and sat down. \"Awesome. In which case...\" He grabbed a cupcake in each hand and crammed them into his mouth. \"...I'm gonna show you just how much I can put away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd, not to be outdone, smirked, pulled a triple-decker cake closer to him, and rather than use a fork, grabbed handfuls of it and crammed them into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl groaned, facepalming. <i>Brother, where are your manners?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless of Al's exasperation, Ed and Hunter continued chomping away, the latter gaining momentum as he grabbed brownies, slices of pie, and anything else that came within his reach. Ed, seeing Hunter start to catch up, started shoveling goodies into his mouth even quicker. Hunter, not to be outdone, drew a bowl of pudding towards himself and grabbed a spoon, tucking in right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl watched the two go at it, shaking his head. <i>I can't believe Brother's doing this again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost against his will, another thought came to him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>By the time Hunter's done, is he gonna need a belly rub?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Al, watching besides the table, shook his metallic head at his older brothers display as he continued to use his bare hands to scoop up chunks of layer cake and stuff it right into his all-too-eager maw.  <i>It's a wonder how either one hasn't accidentally bitten off a finger yet...</i>  Al thought, as he bared witness to the piggish sight.  Still, despite himself, he couldn't help but chuckle at the thought as another crept into his mind. <i> Actually, seeing Brother try to ever explain that to Winry could be worth a laugh.  Least it'd teach him to never go this overboard again...</i>  His train of thought was promptly interrupted as a slab of cake splattered against the younger Elric's 'face'.  <i>Or not...</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling a bit nervously, Ed rubbed the back of his head sheepishly as Al wiped his helmet whilst giving Ed something of a death glare and said, \"Ehhh hehe, sorry about that, Al.  Went kinda nuts with the cake for a second there.\"  Hunter snickered to himself as he wiped his own maw and added, \"You'll have to excuse your brother, Al.\"  He then grinned slickly and added, \"He's trying his very best to keep up with yours truly, and I think that perhaps it might be a little easier said than done.\"  Ed cocked an eyebrow up as he retorted with, \"Oh ho ho, is THAT so...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing all too well how competitive Ed could get, Al took the hint and preemptively took a good few steps back to avoid any more mishaps.  Al raised his hand up and cautioned, \"Brother, just try not to go a little too-\"  Before he could finish, Ed immediately began shoveling more and more cake into his mouth.  Grinning, Hunter also wasted no time picking up the pace as he tore into more muffins at a surprisingly quick pace for such a heavy pastry.  At this point, Al had given up on trying to keep Ed from going TOO overboard, so he shrugged to himself and noted, <i>Well, at least he didn't call Ed a pipsqueak again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two carried on for a good while, consuming an ample amount of pastries and treats each.  As time pressed on, the two began to slow down a slightly noticeable amount, as the volume of food consumes had become a bit more apparent.  Having eaten an ample amount thus far, Ed's stomach was now bulging out noticeably still contained from beneath his red t-shirt.  Even Hunter's own tummy had expanded to a similarly distended state from beneath his black tank-top, though it was still a tad smaller than Ed's tummy since Ed was still just slightly bloated after working off his previous victory at the competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, even in their slowed state, neither one had flagged just yet.  Glancing back at Hunter, Ed smirked and said, \"Boy, you weren't kidding.  You can sure put 'em away, can't you?\"  Hunter patted his stomach proudly and grinned as he said, \"Well, they don't say 'wolf down' for nothing, y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the two continue a bit of idle back and forth chatter, Al eased up slightly, seeing that at least this little mini-competition of theirs was good natured, and not likely to end with Ed making a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, it's too bad you didn't enter that eating contest.  I think you could'a done pretty well in it,\" Ed said.  Hunter rubbed the back of his head and grimaced as he said, \"Ehhhh, I'm not so sure that'd go well with some people seeing a wolf-guy at a crowded eating competition,\" he then jokingly turned to Al and added, \"SOME have a tendency to assume I'm out to eat them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl chuckled a bit and said, \"Heh, yeah sorry about that.\"  Hunter waved his hand-paw dismissively and said, \"No biggie.  First impressions tend to be a mixed bag for me anyway, so I'm used to it.\"  Al laughed a bit more mischievously and added, \"Still, I actually think people would be a little relieved to see you eating yourself silly at a competition.  Because at least that way, even if you wanted to eat anyone, your tummy would be too full to fit anyone else inside.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three laughed a bit at the remark, seemingly less tense than prior, before Ed and Hunter resumed scarfing down the goods still remaining on the table, all the while, both their bellies continues to expand as more and more content occupied them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on...</span></div></div>",

Al, though he was now standing a good distance from both of them, still had to duck out of the way of a particularly large chunk of pie. <i>Brother, where are your manners?!</i> He shook his head at the strange wolf-person happily stuffing his craw. <i>Hunter certainly isn't helping matters, that's for certain...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, their stomachs had expanded some more, bulging out even further, to the point where they looked as though they were hiding basketballs under theirs shirts. They were still concealed, thankfully, but it wouldn't be much longer before their midsections were seeing the light of day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to punctuate this thought, Ed belched queasily, having just downed a particularly big chunk of cake. Groaning, he leaned back in his chair and massaged his belly. \"Oh man, so many sweets...I gotta take a breather...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Ed was resting up, Hunter gulped down what was left of a bowlful of pudding, licked his chops, and dropped his spoon. Like Ed, he leaned back in his chair, resting one arm on the back of the chair while the other massaged his tummy. \"Phew, can't remember the last time I ate so many sweets at once...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl watched the two as they rested and rubbed their bellies, unable to repress a mental smile as Ed's queasy expression slowly became one of content. His gaze then went to Hunter; the anthro-wolf's eyes were closed and his tongue stuck out the side of his muzzle as he rubbed his gut. <i>Heh, he actually looks sorta cute like that...</i> the younger Elric thought, surprised that he was thinking like that. <i>Still, his tummy's gotta be feeling uncomfortable right now...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot fully believing what he was about to do, Al 'cleared' his 'throat'. \"Uh, Hunter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes snapping open, the wolf looked toward the animated suit of armor. \"Something up, Al?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl took a deep breath. \"Um...I was just...wonderingifyou'dletmerubyourtummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's eyes widened, his ears perking up; even Ed looked at his brother strangely. \"Um, sorry; would you mind repeating that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry,\" Al apologized. Taking another deep breath, he asked, \"I know this is gonna sound really weird, but...can I rub your tummy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's eyes went wide at this. \"Uh, Al, what're you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, however, beat him to the punch. \"Sure!\" he exclaimed, his tail wagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Ed and Al both exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter nodded happily. \"It's been a while since I've gotten one, since I'm kinda weirded out at the idea of asking people for one, even if they'd be more than willing.\" He patted his belly prouudly. \"Not to mention, even with a just a mildly stuffed belly, a tummy rub would feel <i>amazing</i>.\" Grinning, he grabbed the bottom of his tank top, pulling it up over his somewhat stuffed, brown-furred tummy. \"You can start whenever ya want, Al.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl blinked, a bit taken aback at Hunter's eagerness. \"Al-alright.\" Making his way over to Hunter, he reached out an armored hand and began gently rubbing Hunter's tummy. The wolf's eyes lit up. \"Oh yeah...that feels great...\" Seeing that Hunter was enjoying it, Al began rubbing a bit more vigorously. Hunter's grin turned dopey, and his tongue started sticking out the side of his mouth. \"Ohhhh yeah...that's the stuff...\" Before long, he began panting, and one of his legs began kicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd watched the sight, completely flabbergasted. <i>Damn; we've seen some weird things over the years, but that's just...</i> Shaking his head, he leaned back in his chair, returning to his own ministrations; not much else he could do until they got their second wind, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes...</span></div></div>",

After a while, even Ed was unable to repress a smile, watching the anthro-wolf guy carry about happily like a puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Hunter slumped back in his chair, tongue still hanging at the side of his mouth.  \"Ohhh man, I can't even describe how amazing that felt!\" Hunter said as he turned to Al and said, \"Thanks a bunch, Al!  Really appreciate it!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl chuckled to himself and said, \"My pleasure.  Just happy to help.\"  Dropping his shirt back over his still swollen tummy, Hunter hopped up to his feet and said, \"Y'know what'd really help wash down all these goodies?  A nice ol' pitcher of milk!\"  Ed's face immediately grimaced at the mere word milk.  Seeing this, Al rolled his fiery eyes and shook his head.  <i>Honestly, Brother...</i>  Oblivious to this, Hunter nonetheless smiled and exclaimed, \"I'll be back in a jiff, fellas!\"  He then headed back to get himself a pitcher while Ed turned his attention to Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Al.  What was the deal with that?\" Ed asked.  Al bashfully rubbed the back of his helmet and said, \"I dunno, I figured since he's a wolf, he'd appreciate a nice tummy rub.  What canine doesn't?  ESPECIALLY after eating that much.  Plus, it was kind of cute, seeing him carry on like that.\"  Ed laughed softly and shrugged, \"Heh, guess it was kinda funny seeing him all loosey-goosey like a big dog or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's laughter immediately stopped when he saw Hunter return with two fairly sizable pitchers of milk.  \"Those....<i>better</i> both be for you....\" Ed seethed, his eye twitching as he said that.  <i>Ohhh boy...</i> Al thought, sensing Ed nearing the red zone, as he took a few more cautious steps away from the table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Hunter chuckled and placed both pitchers down on the table and said, \"Hehe, okay look, I know you're not the biggest milk fan-\"  Hunter stopped and glanced curiously at Ed.  If he didn't know better, he could swear his head was literally steaming with anger.  Chuckling a bit more nervously, he nonetheless regained composure and said, \"J-just hear me out, okay?  If that contest proved anything, it's that despite how much you hate...HATE milk, you can still drink it, right?  Well, I think after drinking as much milk as you did in one single sitting, maybe you've started to build a tolerance for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tolerance?  For MILK?!\" Ed shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl almost interjected to try and calm Ed down, but knew better and immediately opted to say nothing.  \"Look at it this way.  If you start to drink it more, maybe you'll hate it less.  I mean, you already had a great deal at that contest, right?  What's a pitcher compared to something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd, still sickened by the audacity of milks' very existence, nevertheless thought for a moment, then...</span></div></div>",

Wait right here!\" Rubbing his own swollen tummy, he sauntered off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do, Ed and Al chatted a bit, talking about their current situation, their thoughts on the matter, and the like. Before long, Hunter returned, pushing a cart laden with several large pitchers, each roughly the size of Hunter's pitchers of milk, each filled to the brim with a different flavor of milkshake. Panting from the exertion, Hunter wheeled it next to Ed's side of the table, allowing the young Alchemist easy access to the thick, sweet  beverages. \"Here...pant...here ya are, Ed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's eyes widened. \"Wow...that's a lotta milkshake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Hunter sat back down. \"Yep, sure is.\" Grabbing a slice of cake, he crammed the whole thing in his mouth, and only chewed a bit before grabbing one of his pitchers of milk, leaning back in his chair, lifting the pitcher up to his still-filled muzzle, and began guzzling it down, washing down the cake. Once he'd gotten it down his throat, he set the milk down, licked his chops, and immediately grabbed a spoon, spooning vanilla ice cream into his maw with one paw while he crammed pawfuls of pie into his mouth with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd, smirking, decided to try a different tactic; grabbing one of his many pitchers of milkshakes (vanilla), he lifted it  to his mouth and tilted it, letting it pour down his throat. Marvelling at how creamy and sweet it was, he kept it up, and he actually got about a quarter of the way through before he had to come up for air. Panting, he took a few deep breaths, licked his lips, then brought it back up to his mouth, intent on finishing as much of the creamy beverage as possible. Grinning at the sight, Hunter set his spoon down and crammed some more pie into his mouth before he too picked up his pitcher of milk and started guzzling it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued doing this for some time, until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Al watched, nearly dumbstruck as both his older brother and the wolf-person continued chugging relentless amounts of their respectively sizable beverages.  All the while, Al glanced down and noticed that both their tummies were inflating outward amply due to the rush of liquid filling their bellies.  The heavy, creamy milkshakes acted as a combination of both ice cream treat and beverage, and as Ed chugged away at the thick liquid, his belly would grow and grow as he pressed on.  Though Ed's stomach was still just a tad larger from his previous escapades, Hunter did a pretty good job keeping up, chugging good portions of milk from his pitcher to wash down various treats, jumping right in for more food, chewing away, and washing it down yet again.  Thus, his own tummy was catching up in a hurry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Ed's stomach had distended so much that it pushed Ed's red t-shirt to the point where it had begun to rise up and just ever so slightly reveal a sliver of flesh at the bottom.  Hunter fared no better, as his black tanktop had also risen up to reveal a sliver of brown fur.  Continuing to shift his focus between the two, Al shook his head and mentally sighed.  <i>It really does figure that the ONLY other person I've ever seen eat as much as Brother is a wolf...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good while continuing this pattern, Hunter had just finished chomping away at a large slice of pie with a slab of ice cream atop it, and with an ample mouthful, he brought the pitcher of milk up and proceeded to take large gulps from the milk, causing his cheeks to bulge comically for a moment before that bulge traveled from his mouth down his throat.  After a few moments, he'd successfully washed down a rather large mouthful, and lowered his pitcher back down, letting out a long burp shortly after before sighing with relief.  \"Hehe, I tell ya, I dunno how anyone can dislike such a nutritious beverage,\" Hunter said, patting his slightly more exposed belly happily, before glancing at the still full second pitcher and licking his lips as he added, \"but far be it for me to complain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd didn't respond, he had simply continued chugging more and more of milkshake, hoping to drain every last drop.  \"Umm?  Brother?  You might want to catch your breath before you make yourself sick.\"  Getting past the second quarter of his shake, Ed continued, until he winced and promptly placed the pitcher down.  Catching his breath and burping wetly, a look of discomfort took Ed's face.  \"How ya holding up there, Ed?\" asked Hunter.  Ed massaged his tummy and said, \"My stomach's kinda feeling constricted actually.\"  Immediately, Al interjected with, \"You might wanna look down, Brother.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  Whadduya-\"  Ed stopped mid sentence, and despite his belly bloating out considerably, he was able to catch his khaki shorts getting snag by the button and zipper, restraining his distended stomach and making it harder to eat anything else.  Ed rolled his eyes and said, \"Figures.  Well, I already busted one pair of pants for one day, don't wanna make the same mistake twice, especially when someone JUST gave 'em to me.\"  Hunter chuckled as Ed proceeded to struggle with his button, fumbling to get a hold of it due to a limitation of mobility.  But after some trial and error, at last, the snag button had been undone, and with it, came any restrictions against Ed's belly as it proceeded to distend further just slightly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with sweet relief, Ed smiled and slumped back against his chair with a goofy smile on his face.  \"Ahhhhh, MUCH better!\"  Ed said as he patted his liberated belly proudly.  Hunter giggled at the sight whereas Al simply shook his head, rubbing the area of his helmet that would be his forehead.  \"...Remind me to never let you go to a buffet ever again...\" Al said.  The others simply laughed as Ed then glanced back down at his milkshake with new found vigor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time, you're going down...\" Ed said, glaring at the remaining contents of his milkshake, before grabbing his pitcher and chugging at a slightly quicker pace than before...</span></div></div>",

Watching, Hunter grinned and noted, \"Careful, Mr. Elric.  Wouldn't wanna get brain freeze, right?\"  Shaking his head, Al sighed at the sight and muttered, \"Brother might be really smart, but honestly, sometimes, I forget he even has a brain to freeze.\"  Hunter snickered at the remark while Ed simply rolled his eyes, still chugging away the second half, until every last drop had been sent right down Ed's cooled throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching loudly, Ed smacked his lips and patted his belly happily, as he exclaimed, \"Wow, I dunno where you got 'em, but these gotta be some of the best damn milkshakes I've ever tasted!\"  Smiling, Hunter simply shrugged and noted, \"Yep, they're pretty good, aren't they?  There's actually a place not too far from here famous for 'em.  I'm kinda surprised you haven't heard of them before.\"  Al chuckled and said, \"Well, we <i>have</i> been rather busy, lately...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, right, hehe, sorry 'bout that,\" responded Hunter, rubbing the back of his head as he chuckled a bit more sheepishly.  But Ed simply waved his hand dismissively as he licked his lips and grabbed another.  \"Hey, you could'a gotten these from the Fifth Laboratory for all I care!  All I know is, this is how a milkshake is supposed to taste!\"  Responded the young Alchemist, before grabbing a grabbing a strawberry shake, and immediately brought the pitcher to his lips and proceeded to gulp down the pink contents relentlessly.  As he chugged and chugged, his already fairly bloated tummy continued to expand and bloat outward, causing his red t-shirt to ride up more and expose more and more flesh below his belly button.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Ed gulp down the frosty dessert beverage, Hunter recalled having tried a few himself.  <i>They are pretty tasty...</i> he thought, debating if he wanted to take one or just leave them all for the FullMetal Alchemist, but Ed, however occupied by his beverage, nonetheless caught the anthro wolf examining the cart of milkshakes and smirked, before pulling his pitcher down and sighing with relief.  \"Hey, help yourself, Hunter!  You're the one who got 'em, besides!  There's plenty to go around!\" he exclaimed with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise however, he got no response...until both Hunter and Al started snickering to themselves, earning a curious glance from Ed.  \"Eh?  What's so funny?\" asked Ed curiously.  Still snickering, Hunter pointed his paw at Ed's face, as he tried to say, \"Errr, hehehe...Mi-mister Elreeehehe...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Al grabbed a pitcher and held it near Ed's face, still laughing.  \"You might want to take a look, Brother...\"  Ed glanced, and immediately his shoulders slouched as he saw his reflection...and a pink ice cream mustache formed over his upper lip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, both Al and Hunter burst into a fit of full blown laughter.  Wiping his face, Ed scowled and grumbled under his breath.  \"This is what I get for trying to be nice,\" he grumbled under his breath.  Wiping tears of laughter from his eyes, Hunter caught his breath and said, \"Aww, c'mon, don't be like that.\"  Al nudged his older brother playfully and added, \"It <i>was</i> pretty funny, Brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping for a moment, Ed also started to chuckle to himself.  \"Heh, guess it was.  Now if only we had whipped cream...then we could'a made it a full beard!\"  Immediately, all three started laughing aloud for a good little while, before Ed grabbed his pitcher once more, ready to take it to town so to speak.  \"Well, Hunter?  You gonna help yourself, or am I gonna have to drink all these milkshakes by myself?\"  He grinned a bit more mischievously and added, \"Cause I'm completely fine with that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Hunter smiled and grabbed a chocolate milkshake pitcher and noted, \"Well, if you insist...\"  The two then clanked their pitchers together, and proceeded to start gulping them down at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they did...</span></div></div>",

It took my all day to make and most of the night to eat, and I was horking for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\"  Izzy said, lazily dragging her toes through the frigid slate-grey water.   She could dimly see the waves crashing against the darkened pillars of the dock through the slats beneath her, and imagined being pulled down into those murky depths, and maybe fighting a shark.  The fancy fluttered out of her head before she could act on it (she could never understand why everyone thought she was so impulsive when she didn't do half the things she thought about doing) and she returned to her boyfriend.   \"So, what was the <i>best</i> sandwich you ever ate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwen stared out over the ocean, and with zen-like calm, he answered, \"The same sandwich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence for a moment, except for the splashing of Izzy's feet.   She was drawing Georges Seurat's \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\" with her toe, although since her medium was water it was impossible to really tell.   Another impulse struck her, this one with all the force of a javelin, and she knew there was no getting around this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to eat that sandwich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but it doesn't exist anymore,\" Owen said, \"and anyway, if a girl ate it, she'd probably die.  It's pretty hardcore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll recreate it,\" Izzy said firmly.   \"We'll break into the kitchen tonight.  And what kind of a lightweight do you think I am, anyway?   I spent six weeks at cheerleading camp living under the dorm of the registered campers and subsisting on a diet of tarantulas and dirt!  I think I can handle a little sandwich.\"  She leaned forward and nuzzled Owen's nose.  \"Besides, it'll be romantic.  We'll have stomach cramps as a couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that heist is impossible!\" Owen lamented.  \"Don't you think I've <i>tried?</i>  That place is like... Fort Knockwurst!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy smirked.  \"Last time, you didn't have <i>me.</i>\"</span></div></div>",

That's all well and good, but I thought I'd do something a little different: specifically, the characters stuff themselves and get big bellies, but they don't gain any real permanent weight. However, they DO end up having to struggle with their guts, and having to deal with them until everything digests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the basic rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo killing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMild swearing is allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo overt sexual overtones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo gaining of permanent weight (however, a bit of extra belly skin following a particularly huge meal is permitted XD )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from that, go crazy and have fun!</td>",
