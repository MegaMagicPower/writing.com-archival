You must only have one set of Digimon/pokemon for each type of it just to avoid one of those continuous loops of characters that stack up and I have to delete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso note that you don't have to put battle sequences and adventures for all the characters, it could be like a life with the humons hanging out or something! ALSO note that the humons are not like humans in reality, they are diffrent, very diffrent with diffrent types and species of humons, let your imagination run wild, but not that wild because they are esscentially humanoid/human, but they are altered and differed over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit* The bestiary! <br>\r\nEdit#2* The move book (Note that Humons can have more than 4 moves)</span></div></div>",

Today is your 13th birthday...well actually that was 2 days ago and you came down with a sickness which you spent several days in your room bed-ridden, but today is the day you get to have your first humon. This is how your journey begins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sleeping on the bed when the alarm blared out very loud which made you jump out of your bed and faceplant onto the ground. <br>\r\n\"I hate it when I do that...oh wait this is the day I get my first humon! Finally!\" You immediately stood back up, left the room, and slid down the stairs to see your mother making something in the kitchen \"Hi mom!\" <br>\r\n\"Oh hi Amy, I see you are up and running again, even when you just got out of bed after 2 days you still have energy to spare\" <br>\r\n\"Sorry mom, but I have to skip breakfast, today I am getting my first humon!\"<br>\r\n\"You know you can't get out-\" Before she even finish you ran out the door \"Why do I even bother?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside it was sunny as it can be, there were peo-I mean pokemon wandering around doing whatever and the labratory was a short distance away. You ran across town greeting pokemon whom which you knew and arrived at the lab, a one floor building with multiple sounds coming from it, You were about to enter when-<br>\r\n\"Hey Amy, don't you dare get your humon without us!\" A male said, you looked behind you to see two of your childhood friends. Rose a Roselia (Completely original) and Stanton a staravia. Both which approached you while tired <br>\r\n\"You don't slow down don't you?\" Rose questioned <br>\r\n\"You guys actually waited until I got better?\" You questioned <br>\r\n\"Of course, it wouldn't be fair for the birthday girl to get last dibs now would it?\" Stanton said <br>\r\n\"Alright, lets go in\" Rose said and all three of you entered the lab where assorted pokemon were working on experiments and computers. The Professor Sarcode himself was at the front next to a computer and capsule. The professor was a intimidating Abomasnow, which everyone says he's friendly, but I am still scared of him a little. <br>\r\n\"Ah yes, you three, I was wondering when you would get your humons\" The professor said and all of us approached the capsule to see it open revealing 3 huballs (Basically like pokeballs, but for humans or humons) <br>\r\n\"Now here is the humons who will be your partners\" Sarcode picked up the huballs and released all three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a slim and tall humon that was in dusty clothing, dusty hat, and had a worn out magnum by his side, the second was a female and she had on leather armor with a rusty blade on her back, and the third was a male with a gasmask, some black clothing, and he had some bottles on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The loner, bladesman, and grendel. Three basic humon types that will be your partners\" Sarcode said<br>\r\n\"Uh, Professor these three humons seem unbalanced\" Stanton said <br>\r\n\"How so?\" Sarcode questioned<br>\r\n\"Well the loner has a gun while the other two have some crap weapons\" <br>\r\n\"You know that humons don't die easily just like that right?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I forgot\" <br>\r\n\"Before you make a decision. The loner is a fast fighter with low defence, the bladesman has a higher defence and attack ratio, but she is slow, and the Grendel has a area of effect attack.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay birthday girl, you pick first\" Rose said as you decide on who to pick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Also the same battle measures apply. Another good thing to know, Humons are used to battle for fun (And increase friendships) and sometimes help with some daily life things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. No gay, no sex, no any of that stuff, no weird fetish, this is +13! <br>\r\n2. To make things diffrent, there can be cursing/swearing (Minor), no gore, but there can be bleeding of real blood or data (No bloodbath, but data bath acceptable)<br>\r\n3. Now here are some things to know, the humons need to be feed and nurtured (Meaning if you don't they die hating you). Also they can either be either be stored in pokeballs (Which are called Huballs) or some sort of capsule, data-disk thing. <br>\r\n4. Also, the humons can speak and there is a aging system in pokemon/digimon through evolution.<br>\r\n5. Though, they do have a leveling system, it also helps to have gear on your humon. Yes you can put gear on them to improve their battling capability. Also to balance things out, the humons can't just kill each other in one hit by hitting them in the head or heart, they have to wear down their health and those specific spots are critical hits. Other body parts cripple them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother note, for every type there should only be 1 character, this is to avoid a endless loop of characters no one will use<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy a adventure and please add, its is going to be impossible to figure this one out by myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso I forgot to mention: Pokemon and digimon can wear clothing, though they are completely optional it isn't required. And before you ask don't even mention the private parts ffs, most of them have fur or scales covering that. Humons are required to wear something to cover them, its not like they can retrack their own parts into their body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing I seem to forgot. The classes of humons are essentially going to be things like: Martial Artist, Samurai, Ninja, duelist's, Archer, hunter, swordsman, and many other variations that will come. So there, now you have the basis on random encounters or allies. </td>",
