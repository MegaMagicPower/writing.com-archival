As always Joey and Tristan were having their usual arguments calling eachothers monkeys and acting like idiots. Tea was walking ahead with Yugi and was exasperated from Joey and Tristan attitude<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously. Will those two ever change? Always arguing for the most stupid reasons\u201d Tea commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Tea, I know that Joey and Tristan sometimes are, well\u2026\u201d Yugi tried to say something<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026annoying?\u201d Tea asked with sarcasm all over her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026iperactive. But they are our friends Tea\u201d Yugi finished<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know Yugi, but still I wish they were not so loud\u201d Tea said and then she thought \u201cthat way we could also spend more quality time together\u201d Tea smiled when then Joey bumped into her causing her to fall<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh so that\u2019s how you want to play huh?\u201d Joey got up without even apologizing to Tea and restarted quarreling with Tristan. Tea, on the ground slowly got up helped by Yugi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI definitely need some female friend\u201d Tea said with anger in her head. While Tea was dusting her clothes, she saw  that Yugi was telling to his two friends to stop acting like buffoons. Tea appreciated very much Yugi\u2019s work and thought \u201cYugi is always so kind and brave. Huh If only he had the body of hunk he will be the perfect man\u201d Tea finished her thoughts when Joey and Tristan apologized to her for what they did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea reacted angrily \u201cCan\u2019t you guys act like normal people and not like baboons for a change?\u201d causing Yugi to laugh \u201cbut alright you guys are forgiven, if you promise to stop acting like this\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPromise\u201d Both Joey and Tristan said but Tea thought \u201cYeah right, give them a couple of hours and they will start their monkey show once again\u201d and with that they moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes they arrived at Yugi\u2019s card game shop and while the boys decided to talk with Granpa Muto to see if any new card had arrived, Tea decided to have a look around and see if there was something interesting in her way. So she looked around, but found absolutely nothing that seemed interesting , until suddenly she heard a whisper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here\u201d the whisper said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the? Who said that?\u201d Tea asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here. What you are searching for is here\u201d the whisper continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious by those words, Tea decided to follow that mysterious voice and it lead her in the back store, looking on the shelf there she found that something was shining right behind a few boxes. Tea moved the boxes away and found that the mysterious glow and whisper came from a card. Tea took it and saw what card was it and so she read the text \"GIRL'S WORLD: This card can only be activated by a female duellist. If this card is activated female gender monsters gain 500 attack and defense points and cannot be destroyed in battle, while male gender monsters lose 500 attack and defense points. Once activeted this card cannot be destroyed. If your opponent is a male duellist, if he loses the duel, this card will change him into a female duellist\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n What will happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was about to return to the main room of the shop, when suddenly she noticed another glow. She went down the hall and found another card. She took it and started to read <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl's dream, continuos spell card. All female monsters gain 300 attack points.

I needed to visit the girl\u2019s room, but I forgot it was not this way\u201d Tea responded with an innocent look on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s that way\u201d Yugi said with his face turning red while pointing to the toilette room behind him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u201d Tea said and with that she went in that direction, also because she really needed to use the toilette. Once she returned the boys were all set and ready to go. Tea decided to take this opportunity. As soon as Joey and Tristan left the shop, she stopped and talked with Yugi for a moment \u201dYugi I have a little favour to ask you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure what is it Tea?\u201d Yugi asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you see. After watching you guys duel for such a long time, I decided to try it myself, only I do not have a lot of cards, and I\u2019m also not very good in strategizing. So I was wondering if you could help me Improve my deck and my skills a bit\u201d Tea asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing no problem\u201d Yugi answered with a big smile on his face and then continued \u201cIf you want we can do it tonight\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be great\u201d Tea responded with a big smile on her face and then she gave Yugi a kiss on the cheek, causing Yugi to become all red once again \u201cSo I\u2019ll see you later Yugi\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing Tea, I\u2019ll be waiting\u201d Yugi responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And with that, Tea left the shop and ran back to her home in order to take all the cards she had in her current possession. She knew that she did not have many of them, but she was sure that with Yugi\u2019s help she could create a very good deck<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she woke up, Mai started to prepare herself, because that day was a very important day for her, it was the day of the final match of the eleventh duel monster tournament that she had participed in the last three months. She had won all the ten previous tournament and she was starting to get quite famous around the world for her duelling skills, and now she was ready to win her eleventh tournament. After taking a shower, get dressed, taking her duel disk and her deck she exited the house and went to her motorbike. After putting her elmet on she started the engine and then she headed for the tournament.<br>\r\nA couple of hours later...<br>\r\nMai exited the dueling arena with the first prize trophy, all happy that she was able to win another time, she  decided to spent the rest of her day shopping in Domino city. Once there she went shopping for new dresses, jewelery and so on, with her good mood to the maximum. After finishing shopping, she stopped to a bar and got something to drink, she heard the television news, and they were talking about the best duelists in the world. Hopping to be on that news, Mai got closer to the Tv and started listening. The speaker started talking \" Yugi Muto once again confirmed to be the king of games, right after him Seto Kaiba take the silver medal, and even though Joey willer has lost a few matches, the statistic indicates that he can win the bronze on a global competition of Duel Monsters, and then...\" and the speaker continued but he never mentioned Mai. Upset with that, Mai took her shopping bags and her trophy and decided to went back home. Once she arrived at home and put all her stuff on the table, Mai jumped on her bed and started thinking \"Yugi and Joey, why is always those two, why can't i ever be on the news, sure Yugi is the king of game and all that but Joey? Come on! He is good but not better than me, he just defeated me once, I wish for another chance, a chance to defeat him\". Mai was really upset and extremly greedy for a rematch with Joey when suddenly a strange light shined on the table of her room; once it was over Mai went to her table and saw a duel monsters card, and so she took it in her hand. She never saw a card like that, it was a field spell card and so, overcome by curiosity, Mai read the card \"GIRL'S WORLD: This card can only be activated by a female duellist. If this card is activated female gender monsters gain 500 attack and defense points and cannot be destroyed in battle, while male gender monsters lose 500 attack and defense points. Once activeted this card cannot be destroyed. If your opponent is a male duellist, if he loses the duel, this card will change him into a female duellist\". What will happen next?</span></div></div>",

Maybe this card is like those, or maybe it's just a fake. Well anyway it doesn't hurt to try it. I'll reorganize my entire deck tonight and when it's done I will challenge Joey and take my revenge on him.\" And with that determination and thirst for victory, Mai took out her deck and all the cards in her possession and started to built a new one.<br>\r\nThe next morning<br>\r\nMai stayed up all night in order to create her new deck and at dawn, she said \" Yes, finally it's complete.

Once activated, everything around the two duelists started to change, Joey and Mai were now surrounded by dolls, cosmetica, fashion, and everything a girl will love. Joey was really confused, \" What in the world is this Mai?\" He asked and Mai responded \" It's my new field spell Joey, and trust me when I say that this is a very powerful card. First of all it cannot be destroyed, second every single female monster on the field gains 500 extra attack and defense points, plus it cannot be destroyed in battle. On the other hand, the male monsters lose 500 attack and defense point.\" Mai explained with a grin on her face to an open-mouthed Joey \" WHAT?\" Asked Joey, but the answer came in a matter of seconds once he saw his panther warrior's attack and defense points drop to 1500 and 1100, while those of cyber harpie raised to 2300 and 1800. At that moment, Joey asked \" Wait a minute, there cannot be such a powerful card without paying a price.\" Mai then responded \" Yes there is but you will see it only at the end of our duel, but for now I play another cyber harpie to double your fun, and like the first one she increase her attack and defense power by 500 points. Now cyber harpie 1 destroy his panther warrior\" . And with that order cyber harpie attacked her opponent, but then Joey shouted \"I activate a trap Magic arm shield, with this trap I can use one of your monster as a shield, and I choose to use your other cyber harpie\" But as soon as the trap was activated Mai countered \" i don't think so, I play a trap card of my own, harpie's veil, thanks to this trap card for this turn any monster with harpie in its name cannot be effected by magic, trap or monster's effects\" \"WHAT?\" asked Joey but it was obvious since his trap card was destroyed and so Mai harpie attacked and destroyed Joey's panther warrior, making his life points go down to 3200. \"Now cyber harpie 2 attack him directly\" Mai shouted but then Joey countered \"I activate scapegoat\" and with that 4 token appeard on the field, and one of them was destroyed by the cyber harpie's attack \"You were able to save yourself, I didn't thought you could have done it. Well I place one more card face down and end my turn\" Mai said with a smile on her face. \"It's my turn then\" Joey said confident but in his voice you could hear a note of nervousism.

Mai laughed \"Oh your poor panther has seen better days\" but Joey kept his cool \"I know sacrifice my panther in order to summon Jinzo ( Att 2400, Def 1500), and so one of Joey's most powerful monsters appeared. Mai waited for Girl's world to do its job, but Jinzo didn't lose any points \"What? Why?\" asked Mai confused, while Joey was celebrating \"Oh yeah, just like I thought\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Mai \"Girl's world's effect target monsters with a gender, but Jinzo is a machine, and machine don't have a gender so your card is useless against Jinzo. Plus with this monster out, you cannot use trap cards\" Joey explained leaving Mai speechless \"Now Jinzo attack her cyber harpie\" and with that Jinzo attacked Mai's monster, but even after the attack, cyber harpie was still standing. Joey looked at Mai for an explanation \"Have you forgot? Female monsters cannot be destroyed in battle if Girl's world is active, but congratulations Joey you actually damaged my life points\" Mai responded.

So cyber harpie 1 attack his Jinzo now\" Mai ordered and with that Cyber harpie destroyed Jinzo \"Now cyber harpie 2 and 3, destroy two f his three scapegoat\"and so they did. Joey was now left with only one monster. \"Don't forget, now that Jinzo is gone, my trap cards are finally free, so now I activate one of my face downs \"Girl's blast\", which allows me to inflict you a damage to your life points equal to the number of girls on my field multiplied for 300, so now you'll lose 900 extra life points\".

One night, Vivian was eating in a chinese restaurant and these were her thoughts \"It's not fair, I lost a couple of duels and now the work of a lifetime went in smoke? Oh I wish there is something I can do to change all of this. If only I didn't lose to Yu.... THAT'S IT. I have to defeat Yugi, okay easier said and done, but still if I may be able to beat him in a duel, I might regain every thing that I lost, and maybe gaining even more. VIVIAN WONG; QUEEN OF GAMES, I like that. All right time to get to work\" said Vivian as soon as she stood up, payed the bill and went home. As soon as she entered her appartment she noticed that something was shinning on the table. Once the light stopped, she took a closer look at the table and noticed that it was a card. Vivian took the card and started reading \" GIRL'S WORLD: This card can only be activated by a female duellist. If this card is activated female gender monsters gain 500 attack and defense points and cannot be destroyed in battle, while male gender monsters lose 500 attack and defense points.

Yugi started bouncing his boobs up and down trying to get over the fact he's a complete woman. Vivian smiled, as she yelled \"Finish Yugi, attack!\" Yugi got up, in shame. The new Yugi looked slightly taller and slightly skinnier. He had the same clothes but a female version. Two large breasts and long hair but spiky. Yugi looked absolutely beautiful. </span></div></div>",

She started her day with a five hours lesson with Doctor Crawler and, unlike almost all her of her friends who spent the entire lesson sleeping, she was focused all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lesson was over, she went with her two best friends, Mindy and Jasmine, to the lunch room and even if she tried to enjoy the meal, she couldn't because her two friends were talking all the time about their 2 favourites arguments: cute boys and find one that can become Alexis's fianc\u00e9. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lunch was over, Alexis had another problem: Chazz. That guy with a massive ego always had a crush for her, so he spent almost 2 hours trying to have a date with her, and Alexis spent those two hours escaping from him. Once she was sure that Chazz has given up, at least for one day, she decided to relax in the best way possible: duelling. So she decided to go to the Duel Accademy training camps in order to have a few matches with some other students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the top female student in Duel Accademy, Alexis won nine match in a row, against two slifers, three ras and four obelisks, three guys and one girl; winning those matches sure gave Alexis back her energy so she decided to have another challenge in order to have ten wins for the day, when suddenly Jaden Yuki arrived at the training camps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Alexis saw him she thought \"Today I'm in great shape, I think I can beat Jaden\" and so Alexis challenged his friend with the red uniform to a duel, but unfortunatly even with all her confidence, Alexis was once again defeated by Jaden, and even though Jaden's good mood was enough to cure pratically everything, this time the wound in Alexis's pride was too deep. Even though Jaden was a great friend, Alexis was never able to defeat him in a duel, not even once; she knew that Jaden's skills were extraordinary, and that he only duel for fun, but that did not make things easier. Inside her room, she was lieing down on her bed, lost in her thoughts <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, why can't I beat Jaden just once, I know that he is a great guy and a great friend, but still the fact that he always defeats me with his carefree attitude makes me feel wounded pride:. They call me the top female student in the accademy but still I've never won against him, is there anyway I can defeat Jaden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as responding at her request a strange light shined on the table of her bedroom; once it was over Alexis went to her table and saw a duel monsters card, and so she took it in her hand. Alexis never saw a card like that, it was a field spell card and so, overcome by curiosity, Alexis read the card \"GIRL'S WORLD: This card can only be activated by a female duellist. If this card is activated female gender monsters gain 500 attack and defense points and cannot be destroyed in battle, while male gender monsters lose 500 attack and defense points. Once activeted this card cannot be destroyed. If your opponent is a male duellist, if he loses the duel, this card will change him into a female duellist\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen next?</span></div></div>",

Ooohhh this is going to be sooo good\" and with these thought on her mind Alexis continued her path towards the slifer red dorm, but especially to Jaden. It was around six in the morning, (Alexis didn't want anybody to see her duel with Jaden) when Alexis knocked the door of Jaden's room, and after a lot of whining, Jaden opened the door. \"Alexis? What bring you to our dorm so early in the morning?\" asked Jaden between a yawn and the other \"Sorry to weak you up so early Jaden, but I just finished to build this new deck and I really want to try it with a worthy oponent. Jaden I want to duel you\" responded Alexis. Those words were enough to wake up Jaden from any kind of lethargy \"Sweet, I don't think there is a better wake up call for me, give me just a second to get dressed and then get your game on Alexis\". said Jaden with his usual big smile on his face, and then he get back in his room to prepare himself. About ten minutes later, Jaden and Alexis were in the middle of the wood staring at eachother. \" I'm confused Alexis, why did you want to duel right here?\" asked Jaden to Alexis, and she responded \" Oh no particular reason, it's just that I like to walk into the wood during the morning, is there a problem Jaden?\" asked Alexis in return. In reality, the reason to duel in the middle of the wood was so nobody would see them. \"No problem at all Alexis just curios, now are you ready to duel?\" asked Jaden \" You bet I am\" responded Alexis with a wicked smile on her face. The they both screamed \"DUEL\". <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At that moment, Jaden asked \" Wait a minute, there cannot be such a powerful card without paying a price.\" Alexis then responded \" Yes there is but you will see it only at the end of our duel, but for now I plat my pot of greed, so I can draw two more cards, and next I summon cyber etoile\" and with that she summoned a new female monster to the field that automatically gained 500 attack and defense points , making then 1700 and 2100. Alexis then continued \" I also play a continuos spell card GIRL SUPREMACY, sure I have to pay 500 of my life points, but from now on everytime a female monster destroys a monster in battle, the controller of that monster will lose 500 extra life points. Now cyber tut\u00f9 attack sparkman\" ordered Alexis, but then Jaden said \" I activate the trap card Hero barrier, so I can block the attack of one of your monsters as long as I have an elemental Hero on my field.\" Jaden was able to save his monster from the attack of cyber tut\u00f9, but then Alexis said \" You cannot stop this attack, cyber etoile destroy sparkman\" and with that sparkman was destroyed and Jaden lose 600 life points \" Not bad ah Jaden, and remember you'll also lose 500 extra life points by this effect of my continuos spell card GIRL SUPREMACY\" and so it was.

Finally Alexis said \" I finally activate my face down card GIRLS BLAST, now for every monster my ladies have destroyed during this turn you'll lose 200 points, and since they destroyed 2 monsters you'll lose 400 life points Jaden\" \"But that means...\" Jaden tried to say, but Alexis stopped him \"That I won J.\". And In fact Jaden life points reached 0. Suddenly the field around them started to glow, and it shrinked around Jaden's body. \"What's going on?\" asked Jaden a little worried, while Alexis was amazed \"It's really working, I cannot wait for this results\" then suddenly a voice spoke in Alexis's mind \"Mistress Alexis\" Alexis then said \"Who is it?\"</span></div></div>",

Render his legs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he did, and Alexis just peered down at him with her arms folded in an X. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden became taller. This was because Alexis had longer legs than she did a waist. With Jaden's waist shortened, Jaden would be at the same height Jaden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn't look right, or feel right Jaden's bloodstream obviously stretched with the increase in length, and cramp was felt around the kneecaps.

She was born as an only child in the slums, she lived with only her mother because her father was a constant drunk, causing her to be scared at the time. She fell for dueling at the age of seven when her mother got her a basic starter deck and gained a major interest in Fairy-type monster as they reminded her of stories her mother told her. When she was eleven, her mother got into a car crash and after that, she couldn't walk anymore. My guess is that accident caused her to become incredibly timid and not being able to show her true feeling around others, and in a weird way, it also caused her to become extremely clumsy. At the age of twelve she learned that her father had passed away from a drunk driving accident, and strangely her mother's condition worsened, and she was no longer capable of taking care of her, so she was adopted by her mother's boss. \"The Princeton family\". Never being treated like a real member of the family, unlike the sons and daughters of Princeton name, who adapted the ideas to occupy the best or most important positions in the world, which Christina slowly adopted as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about a month before she arrived at the Duel Academy, when we were invited at one of their fancy parties, we saw Christina speak to her step sisters Nina and Dina, and with their disgusting voices and laughed as they were making fun of her, and then Christina swore to them that she was going to be the best here at the Academy, no matter what. Nina and Dina laughed at her, but they accepted the deal that if she was able to accomplish that, then the entire Princeton family would start to respect her. She barely made it into the Duel Academy and was accepted as a Slifer Red, but began to challenge many Obelisk Blues to show that she could gain the respect of her adopted family, trying to get the attention to be moved up out of Slifer Red Dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, The Spirit carried Christina back to her dorm and then changed her clothes, room, and items, making sure that every detail was changed about the former Chazz Princeton...</span></div></div>",

She fell for dueling at the age of seven when her mother got her a basic starter deck and gained a major interest in Fairy type monster as they reminded her of stories her mother told her. When she was eleven, her mother got into a car crash and after that she couldn't walk anymore. This caused her to become incredibly timid and not being able to show her true feeling around others, and in a weird way, it also caused her to become extremly clumsy. At the age of twelve she learned that her father had passed away from a drunk driving accident. She decided to keep her mother's last name as Prince as spent most of her time practicing her dueling skill where at the foster home, she became known as 'The Foster's Fairy', the best duelist there. Soon at the age of fourteen, she heard about Duel Academy and went to sign up for it. She learned that there were much stronger duelist and barely made it,also because of her clumsiness, putting her in the Slifer Red Dorm, . She eventually became friends with Syrus, Chummy, Alexis, Jane, Bastion, Mindy, Jasmine and many others. She secretly has a crush on Bastion, but can't show it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, that should work well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe read over the made-up file for Chazz's new identity with a smile. \"Perfect.\" She then heard a knock at the door as she folded it up and pocketed the paper. \"Come in.\" The door opened to see. . .</span></div></div>",

Christina thought as the water ran down her body and hair as she cleaned, \"Jerks, didn't even step on any on my trap. I'll show them later. I still have a couple of days till the Battle Royal, so which means I have alot of time to prepare for other traps and my deck. But the only problem is who to go after? Jane and Alexis didn't touch my trap, Jaden might be an idiot at times, but he never goes back on his word, My only options would be either duel against Adam, duel against the others, or keep setting my traps till it gets one of them.\" Christina shut off the water, dried her hair, then got reclothed in a new, clean Slifer Jacket, but then Christina could hear some footsteps above her as she finished. Christina knew that meant Jaden just got back, but she wasn't expecting what she heard Jaden say though the floor boards, \"I'll catch you later tomorrow, Adam, maybe we'll have to duel soon for some practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina was shocked that something actually good was happening to her. Adam Kaiser was in her reach for a duel and also a chance to get into the Battle Royal. But then her shyness slowly started to creep in, since Christina never dueled Adam, or even spoke to him. Does Christina take the chance to get in the duel against Adam Kaiser, or does her shy side take over and she misses a great opportunity?</span></div></div>",

She was standing in front of a mirror and took her time to analyze herself before she looked at the room around her, she was at the Princeton home that she knew so well, but it was quiet, which was very usual. Christina then walked towards the door and saw that their was a party going on in the main hall of the Princeton home. As she exited her room, all the eyes shifted on her for a moment as she joined the party. She felt embrrassed, but continued onward. She very gently walked down the stairs and saw a very dressed up masked man waiting for her at the bottom of the steps, now noticing that this party was a masquerade. The man with the mask then spoked, \"Good evening, Miss Hime, may I partake you to the dance floor?\" Christina, watching this dream as her dream self said yes to masked man and took his hand, following him to the dance floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began to dance, but even in her dreams, Christina was still somewhat clusmy, but the man in the mask didn't mind her clumsiness and just kept dancing with her, slowly moving them into the center of the dance as the other party members watched from the tables and the balconies that Christina was dancing with a elegant young man. What seemed like hours of dancing brought a smile to Christina's face and that someone was interested in her made her cheek reds. As the dance was nearing it's end, the young man then moved close to Christina and gently planted a kiss on her lips as the song reached it's final note, hearing roars of clapping hands as they pulled away. Christina watched as her dream self gently touched the man's cheek and slowly pulled away the mask to see Adam, smiling back to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Christina woke up from her slumber and what felt like minutes of bliss become hours of sweet dreams that were ruined by her alarm clock, telling her it was time to get an early headstart on the day. As she got up however, she noticed she wasn't where she was before and was still clothed. Along with all this, there was also a single pack of cards sitting right next to her alarm clock, giving her many questions to think about if she choose to ponder on them at the moment.</span></div></div>",

Why would her own mind be trying to mess with her own plans to become the best?

You have some nerve invading my dreams\", Christina shouted at her own reflection, gazing directly into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rough Night, Boss.\" Omaja Yellow's voice chimed as he appeared before Christina replied while trying to push Omaja Yellow away, \"This is not the time for any interruptions right now...I thought we talked about this!

Right after she opened the pack, the top card was an equip spell, Fairy Meteor Crush, which could help her monsters pierce into her opponents life points. Christina had one already, but now she had another one to add to her deck. The next card was very new to Christina, at the pic, it looked like a warrior type, but it was actually a fairy. The Card's name was Angel Swordsman. The picture was a grey haired young warrior with large angel wings holding a sword wear a white coat. Christina noticed it had an effect that made the swordsman even stronger. The following card kept Christina's interest a light by seeing too more light monsters that also were Fairies: Tethys, Goddess of Light and Airknight Parshath. Christina was very surprised that the card pack of five cards had alot of neat finds in ths deck. But the last card in the pack was turned the other way, making it's identity a secret. Christina then placed the other four away, but close to her and then turned the hidden card, which reveal the last fairy that was powerful and had a great effect. Christina smiled at the last card, known as Darklord Desire, and then thoughts came to her as she thought and brought out her fairy deck, placed the new cards inside it, shuffled them up, and placed them back inside and then headed back to sleep, entering a dream-filled world of her own imagination.</span></div></div>",

Once she was in her bed, both professor Banner and Miss Fontaine warned me about her, about her attitude and schemes. Well I was wondering if you could tell me if there is some sort of reasons for her behaviour, because she doesn't seem evil to me\" Adam asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane and Alexis looked at eachother and sighed.

Did something bad happened to her in the past?\" asked Adam curious<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Jane responded \"Yeah, she was born as an only child in the slums, she lived with only her mother because her father was a constant drunk, causing her to be scared at time. She fell for dueling at the age of seven when her mother got her a basic starter deck and gained a major interest in Fairy type monster as they reminded her of stories her mother told her. When she was eleven, her mother got into a car crash and after that she couldn't walk anymore. My guess is that accident caused her to become incredibly timid and not being able to show her true feeling around others, and in a weird way, it also caused her to become extremly clumsy. At the age of twelve she learned that her father had passed away from a drunk driving accident, and strangely her mother's condition worsened, and she was no longer capable to take care of her, so she was adopted by her mother's boss. The Princeton family\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You mean...\" Adam asked but Alexis quickly responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that rich family of snobs, Jane and I met them more times that we like to remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is right, well Christina was adopted by them, but she was never really threated as part of the family, expecially by the two daughters of the Princeton, Nina and Dina. You see the Princeton family's objective is to occupy the best or most important positions in the world. The two sons are a big political and financial expert, while Nina and Dina are a world famous actress and top model\" Jane responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but in reality they never reached those results in a fair way, they scared, blackmailed, and destroyed their opponents. And I am afraid that that's the only lesson that Christina was able to learn from them.\" Alexis said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked both Adam and Jaden, since he joined the conversation as well. Alexis then continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was about a month before we arrived at the Duel Academy, when we were invited at one of their fancy party, we saw Christina speak to her step sisters Nina and Dina, and with their disgusting voices and laughes they were making fun of her, and then Christina sweared to them that she was going to be the best here at the Academy, no matter what. Nina and Dina laughed at her, but they accepted the deal that if she was able to accomplish that, then the entire Princeton family would start to respect her\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jane restarted \"Well you could imagine what was the reaction of Nina and Dina once they discovered that Christina was a slifer red. She was so embarassed that from that day, she started challenging the Obelisk Blue Female students all the times, especially me and Alexis, since we are considered to be the best. I think that her results so far are 425 losses and 0 victories\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow she never won, even once?\" asked Adam surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not against us\" responded Alexis. \"She was able to defeat a few slifer students, but I'm afraid that her numbers of victories so far don't go over the 2 units. And I'm afraid that she also holds a grudge against you Jaden\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? But why? I never did something to her\" Jaden responded  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hates you because you are a slifer like her, but unlike her you have won almost all your matches. So after a couple of months here, she decided to start her personal war against all of us, and not only in terms of duelling\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of her schemes?\" asked Adam<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, she decided to use the Princeton family style to take care of her opponents. But she never really had much success\" responded Alexis<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We tried to help her, to make her our friends, but she is too stubborn and too full of pride to accept our help, and her behaviour doesn't really help. We cannot hate her, because it's not all her fault, but she decided on her own to walk the path of \"war\" and loneliness instead of becoming our friend\" Jane explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't gave up on her, but still we have to defend ourselves from her schemes\" Alexis said and then they all started to look at Christina</span></div></div>",

Once she took a bite of it, she immediately started to sweat, and quickly she put her hands on her throat, realising what she just ate.

But remember, that's because you chose this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam then add \"Swallow your pride Christina, we really want to help you, to be your friends\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Christina was in tears, but then she noticed that Jane and Adam were about to leave.

After a few seconds she passed the ball to Rurina who, together with Ririna, started a serie of passes on the field, and then they passed to Meru who jumped and made two points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right nice works girls\" Naomi said by catching Christina and making her spinning on her index <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks captain, never had so much fun during a training\" Asuna responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, using that ball is awesome \" Meru continued and all the girls agreed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear that bally? you rock\" Naomi said to christina who was feeling pretty lousy for all the hits that she received by hitting the ground so many times as a ball. \" All right girls, let's continue\" Naomi screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH\" the team responded and with that they restarted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the air over the basketball field<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boss is in big trouble\" Ojama yellow said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again\" Ojam green continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to ask for help\" Ojam black said and with that they went looking for the other Duel spirits of the Academy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they found Burst lady, Cyber Tutu, Winged Kuriboh and White Dragon Ninja they explained what happened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please help our Boss\" the trio of ojama pleaded the other spirits<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will\" Cyber tutu said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go warn our masters\" Burst Lady continued and Winged Kuriboh and White Dragon Ninja agreed, and so they went looking for the gang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They all went to the same academy for girls where they learned about dueling and medicine since they all wanted to work in the medical department. Linda and Amanda may had missed classes from time to time, but they were passionate with their work and were able to graduate from their academy. Linda had an interest in using plants for medicine which was the reason she ended up using a plant based deck. Amanda liked seeing children in hospitals playing with toy and that lead her to using a toy based deck. Eventually, the three were all able to get jobs at Duel Academy, each of them becoming the headmistress of one of the dorms, Fonda working with the Obelisk Blues, Amanda with the Ra Yellows and Linda with the Slifer Reds. Linda and Amanda ended up liking the Slifers more then the others because they reminded them of themselves when they were in the academy. They continue to work to this very day, enjoying their days of teaching students of Duel Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll work.\" Alexis muttered as she took a breath of relief before snapping her fingers. \"Oh!\" She then started to write another section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>Extra Notes:</b></i></u> Amanda has a crush on Sartyr and is the adopted mother of Marcel. Linda has a crush on Chancellor Shepard, but he is dense about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis chuckled at this. \"Yeah, Professor Sartyr's a nice teacher and deserves someone. Amanda. . .a little payback.\" She giggled as she finished, satified with her results as she folded it up. \"Now then. . .when should I duel the both of them?\"</span></div></div>",

After she put it on and the two girls both screamed \"DUEL\" as they each draw five cards<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first\" Naomi said and with that she drew a card \" I summon Dark Witch in attack mode (Lv 6, att 2600, def 1000)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? A level 6 monster on the first turn?\" Christina exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she can be special summon on my first turn, if there are no other cards on my field, but if I do that, I cannot make any normal summon during this turn. Also she cannot destroy monsters in battle, but that's no matter because as soon she attacks a monster that monsters loses half of his attack or defense point\" Naomi explained \"Next I play the spell card Dark assault, if I have a monster with Dark in its name, then that monster can cut its attack power in half and launch a direct attack for this turn, so now Dark Witch attack her directly, dark assault\" Naomi ordered and the attack went successfull<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi 4000, Christina 2700<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now activated the spell Dark assorber, which allows me to take  the life points you just lost, so your loss becomes my gain\" Naomi said and then laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi 5300, Christina 2700 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally I play one face down and end my turn\" Naomi said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay my move\" Christina said \" And I play Gracefull charity, now I can draw three cards but then I have to discard two from my hand\" and so Christina discarded the spell card Ojamagic and the monster card Tomb Fairy from her hand \"Now thanks to Ojamagic I can draw the three Ojama brothers from my deck, also if Tomb Fairy is sent from my hand to the graveyard, it allows me to summon two fairy token on my field\" Christina said as she added three cards from her deck and summoned two token on her field \" I now sacrifice my tokens to summon Guardian Angel Joan in attack mode (Lv 8, att 2800, def 2000), next since I summoned a high level fairy type monster I can special summon the Angelic Archer from my hand in attack mode (Lv 3 att.800 def. 400) and I'll equip her with Cestus of Dagla, making her attack points rise by 500. Also she can attack my opponent directly. But first Saint Joan attack the Dark Witch\" Christina ordered her monster<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate a trap card Dark exchange\" Naomi screamed \"Since you attacked a Dark monster, I can choose another one on my hand, summon it in attack mode and making him the new target, and I choose Dark spirit\" Naomi said by summoning a new monster on the field (Lv4, Att.Def. 1300)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter attack\" Christina screamed and with that her monster destroyed Dark Spirit \"Now since Saint Joan destroyed a monster in battle, I regain life points equal to the attack points of the monster I just destroyed\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi 3800, Christina 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now Dark Spirit effect is activated, if he is destroyed in battle, the monster responsible loses 1300 attack and defense points\" Naomi said as Saint Joan got weaker (att.1500, def.700)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case Angelic Archer attack Naomi directly\" Christina orderd to her other monster and the attack went successfully \" And also since he was equiped with Cestus of Dagla, your loss is my gain this time\" Christina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi 2500, Christina 5300.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally I play two face down cards and end my turn\" Christina said as she placed on the field the trap cards Covering fire and Angel baton ( a trap that allows the player to summon a level 4 or lower fairy type monster from his/her deck if one on the field is destroyed)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then my turn\" Naomi said as she draw her next card and smiled \"I summon the tuner monster Dark Ambra (Lv3. Att. &amp; Def.0) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tuner Monster?\" Christina asked surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. This is the future of Duel Monster you fool\" Naomi explained and then continued  \"and now allow me to show you this incredible power, the power of Synchro as I now tune my Dark Ambra with Dark Witch in order to synchro summon...</span></div></div>",

Now my seductress attack St. Joan with Dark Mist of Seduction\" Naomi ordered her monster, who inhaled a lot of breath, making her boobs grow and bounce, and after that she expelled a dark purple mist from her lips that attacked Christina's monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play my trap, covering fire so now I can reduce the damage of your attack by making the Angelic Archer share her power to St. Joan\" Christina said by activating her trap and making St.joan attack power gp up to 2800, but it was still not enough to defeat Naomi's monster. And in fact St.Joan was destroyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi 2500, Christina 4200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next her second special ability kicks in, since she destroyed a monster in battle you lose another monster, so say farewell to your Archer\" Naomi said as she pointed to Christina's other monster who exploded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn\" Christina whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's not all. You will now lose lifepoints equal to half the sum of the original attack points of both your monsters\" Naomi said by snapping her fingers, and with that Christina lost 1800 life points<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi 2500, Christina 2800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally I play the spell card Dark spell of Naomi\" Naomi said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" Christina asked with another face of disgust<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deadly serious\" Naomi responded with a grin on her face\" I can only play this card if Dark Seductress Naomi is on the field and if a monster on your field has been destroyed by her special power. Now you'll lose a number of life points equal to that monster original attack points, while I regain that same amount\" Naomi explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way\" Christina exclaimed, but it was all true, since Dark Seductress Naomi pointed her finger to Christina and emitted a beam of light who hitted her at the heart, subtracting her energy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi 3300, Christina 2000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I play my second trap, Angel Baton\" Christina said with pain in her voice and then continued \"Since you destroyed one of my monsters in battle, I can now summon a level four or lower fairy type monster from my hand or deck, and so from my deck arrives Fairy Disciple ( Lv2, att. &amp; def. 300)\" and with that, what looked like a little pixie appeared on the field<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah, you really are pathetic, reling on those pathetic creatures to save yourself\" Naomi laughed and then said \"Anyway, I end my turn, let's see what you got princess\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you'll see all right you bitch, it's my turn\" Christina said and drew a card \"First since it's my stand by phase, the effect of Fairy Disciple is activated, now I can summon up all the Fairy Disciples that I have in my hand, deck or graveyard\" Christina explained as she summoned two more Fairy Disciples on the field \"Next I'll play Pot of Greed, so I can draw two more cards\" Christina continued as she looked at her two new cards and smiled \"I now sacrifice my three monsters in order to summon my ultimate weapon\" And with that the three little fairies that Christina had on her field disappeared and instead a beautiful and shinny tall Fairy with gold hair appeared \"Meet Chrianna, the Fairy Queen (Lv9, att.2900, def.2600)\" Christina said<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Another fairy? You really are pathetic! Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah\" Naomi laughed again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laugh while you can\" Christina thought and then said \" Since I sacrificed three fairy mosters, I can now activate all three of her special abilities\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you said 3?\" Naomi asked a little bit scared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the first one is that for every monster card I discard from my hand, a monster in your graveyard is removed from play, so I discard the three ojama brothers Iin my hand to remove your three Dark monsters in your graveyard\" Christina explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Nami screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it boss\" The ojama trio said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys and sorry\" Christina said to her cards, while discarding them. After that, the three Dark monsters In Naomi's grveyard where removed from game, making the attack power of Dark Seductress Naomi go down to 3000.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next the second ability, by paying 1000 of my life points I can resurect up to 2 fairy type monsters from my graveyard, so let's say welcome back to St. Joan and the Angelic Archer\" Christina said and after paying the price her monsters resurected<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi 3300, Christina 1000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight, you sacrifice three cards and a 1000 life points just to resummon two weaklings and making my monster just a little bit weaker?\" Naomi asked with a sarcastic ton of voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for it, I still have one ability to play. By discarding my entire hand to the graveyard and paying half my lifepoints, for this turn only my queen will gain the ability of absorb the attack power of every fairy type monster on the field\" Christina said as she discarded her two cards and payed half of her lifepoints<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi 3300, Christina 500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT? NO WAY! IT'S NOT FAIR\" Naomi screamed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it is fair\" Chrstina said as she saw her monster attack power grow to 6500 \"Learn this lesson of humility Naomi, you'll never win unless you change, and redime yourself\" Christina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP! I'M A TRUE CHAMPION NOT A WEAKLING LIKE YOU\" Naomi screamed with rage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you'll never learn huh? Well let me tell you something Miss Champion, YOU LOST\" Chrsitina screamed and then ordered \"CHRIANNA ATTACK HER MONSTER NOW, WITH SUPREME WIND OF THE FAIRIES\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Chrianna started to dance and then emitted a light blue wind which destroyed in an instant Naomi's monster<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi 0, Chrsitina 500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lost Naomi\" Christina said, but then she noticed something that scared her a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\" Naomi screamed for the frustration and also because she saw that her entire body was enveloped by a dark flame. After about one minute, Naomi stopped screaming felt on the ground unconscious. Christina quickly ran to her and checked her pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good she is still breathing, but I wonder what happened to her\" Christina thought and then decided \"I should go to</span></div></div>",

I cannot believe that someone from I.I. will create those cards expecially for them?\" Christina asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they created themselves\" Jane proposed \"Rurina and Ririna were pretty good in drawing, so they designed those cards for themselves and the others\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But their duel disk shouldn't have been able to read them\" Adam then said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless they were powered up by the darkness.\" Jaden said by taking the word for the first time \"They were not using normal dueldisk.

Once they got back in health, the police arrested them. Thanks to Naomi's father, his daughter and her friends were able to escape prison, but he had to pay an ingent sum to the Duel Academy to cover up this story. Naomi, however, along with her friends were forced to pass the next ten years of their lifes in a woman military campus, a very strict one too. And after that, they will pay their debt with society by doing only comuity services for work. Their lives as duelists and basketball players were officially over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the cafeteria of the Duel Academy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is it\" Jane finished reading the news about Naomi she had just received from her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those bitches sure deserve that\" Hasselberry commented after hearing the news from Jane<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still I am sad.

REALLY?\" the entire table asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, about a couple of months ago, she met this guy called Jose Panaguam, he is brazilian.\" Alexis said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is very good at dancing and also he is a real artist. He loves dueling very much, but I think his true passion is in painting, and I cannot blame him: his paintings are really beautiful\" Jane commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does he paint?\" Adam asked out of curiosity<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is an excellent landscapist, (you should see the painting he did of the Duel Academy island), but he also likes to paint duelling scenes, even tough he always put something extras in them.\" Jane explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He believes that mother nature is already perfect, so it doesn't need any help, but since every duel could always use a little more uhf, he always put something extra in them\" Alexis explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is also not very rich, so I guess that's one of the things that Christina likes in him, he is fighting with his own strengh to help his relatives. Christina fought with her own strengh as well, but only for herself, never for others, until she joined us\" Jane continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it was love at first sight when they met, Jose is also trying to teach her the samba right now\" Alexis said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I wonder if the power of love can cure Christina from her clumsiness?\" Jane asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that will be a challenge\" Alexis responded causing a group of laugh</span></div></div>",

But Mindy saw him occasionally glance at Christina with a somewhat worried expression. Does Mindy tell Jane and Alexis about a possible suitor for Jane?</span></div></div>",

That's the mark of a great duelist. Chazz instead based almost all of his game on monsters cards, expecially monsters with effect, like his vwxyz combo or his armed dragons, but those are pretty powerfull cards, expecially because they have the power to destory your cards. But in order to do that Chazz must discard cards from his hand. His spell and trap cards are almost all cards that help his monsters to stay on the field. My advice is that you must create a strategy to prevent Chazz from destroying your cards.

Jane the princess of cards has finally found love? Come on Jane spilled out, what do you think of him?\" \"Girls please, stop\" Jane responded, like a red pepper, \"I'll tell you everything, but I'd like to wait for my cousin first\" \"Well you don't have to wait much longer because Alexis has just arived\" responded Jasmine by pointing the entrance of the hall , where Alexis was in line to take something to eat. As soon as she finished, Alexis saw her friends and reached them at their table. \"\"Morning Alexis\" said the three girs together, but Alexis was a little bit angry,\"Jasmine why did you lie to me?\"asked Alexis with an angry tone \"Lied about what?\" asked Jasmine a little bit confused \"There was nobody in the forest waiting for me near the lake.\" Alexis angrily explained, making Jasmine remember her trick to separate the two cousins \"What? What is the meaning of this Jasmine?\" asked Jane. Jasmine looked Mindy, looking for backup \"Well you see...\" Jasmine tried to explain but then Mindy intervened \"That duelist was a coward, as soonas he leart that you were his opponent he ran away. It's not Jasmine's fault for what happened to you last night\". Mindy'explanation was a little bit weak, but Alexis decided to believe her friends \"All right girls, I trust you\" was her final answer. Jasmine breathed a sigh of relief \"So what's the sitch? What were you talking about?\" Alexis then asked. At that point both Jasmine and Mindy looked at Jane with big smile on their faces. \"Fine\" was Jane answer</span></div></div>",

Around 15.00, the gang decided to get up and go have some fun all together, but Jane and Adam had other plans so, as soon as they could, and the chance came when Jasmine and Mindy had to go to the bathroom, the two lovebirds left their friends and run outside the building.

Everytime, Jane heard those comments, she immediately reacted and she even slapped the last one. At the end of the day Jane greeted Adam and said \"If it wasn't for those jerk it would have been a perfect day\"\"It's not your fault Jane, although I have to admit you have a really nice slap\" and after a good laugh, the two lovebirds greeted eachother with a kiss and then Jane left for her dorm.

It didn't take long to find what she was looking for, in fact after a while she found two obelisk blue students lying on the ground. Jane went immediately to check on them \"Oh no!

I'm sorry guys, but before I'll call Ms Fontaine, I have to know who is the culpit\" and with that said Jane restarted her search. As soon as she stood up, she heard a moan, and so she immediately went to look for the source of that moan. After a little run she found two duelists battling. She recognised the one that was losing, his name was Ryan, another obelisk blue member of Jane and Alexis's fan club, and the other was \"Adam?\"  Jane whispered horrified. \"It's my turn, and now by removing 3 dark attribute monsters from my graveyard, I'll special summon the instruement of your destruction\" Dark Adam screamed and with that he summoned a new monster that Jane never saw in hos deck \"Wait I give up\" Ryan said, but Dark Adam responded \"Ah ah ah ah ah ah, too late for that now my beast send this loser into the shadows\" and with that a giant shadow surrounded the two duelists. After a few seconds, the shadow disappeared but only Dark Adam was still standing on the battlefield, while Ryan was lying down on the ground \"Another loser into the shadows, if this keeps up, I'll be unstoppable in no time ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah! Well it was another profitable night, now I better go to rest a little\" and with that Dark Adam headed for his room. From her corner Jane was horrified and on the verge of tears \"So it's true!

Like I mentioned before, My father worked extensively with Seto Kaiba and Maxamillion Pegasus, but he mainly worked with Seto. When I was younger and learning about Duel Monsters, I was given a tour of KaibaCorp. Like today, Seto wasn't the happiest guy, but he knew that I was different than the other worker's kids. About half a year after that, My Father got me a deck and trained with me a little, then a few days, Me and my father went back to KaibaCorp, Mokuba saw me shuffling my deck in my father's office and wanted to duel against me. I wasn't good with my cards, but I accepted. I lost the first duel against him, but then after a few more duels, I was able to get him down lower, but still lost. Little did we know, Seto and my father was watching us from his office. Seto wondered why I didnt just gave up after the first loss, since he saw I wasn't any good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam took a short breath and continued, \"During the time until my next visit, I watched many duels and I formally met Pegasus, who took great interest to me and my deck. After the duels with Mokuba, my father was working on a big project for Seto, so I stayed longer and got more acquainted with Mokuba. After a while, I got a new deck, My Dragons that I use now. I kept my old warriors deck and placed it in a safe spot at home. Me and Mokuba were close friends when I got my dragons, he always thought I was turning into Seto. But Seto knew I treated Mokuba like a brother to me, and he respected that. Then about a year after that, Seto came to me and saw my deck was all dragons, no other card but dragons. He heard that I started beating Mokuba with these, so he challenged me. I knew it was a great honor so I brought everything to the duel. Seto didn't trash talk as much, since I was the son of his most valued worker. I did lose the duel, but I got him down to 100 life points, and I had the right card to finish him next turn. Seto smiled and started to \"tudor\" me on combos with my deck. When I dueled a bully in my school, he was decimated and couldn't touch me. About near the end of high school, Kaiba gave me a graduation gift, 3 copies of his most infamous card, Blue-Eyes White Dragon. I was speechless. He told me that this is my gift to you for all your hard work and for taking card of my brother. I accepted them and after that, I became close friends with Seto.\" Adam then stopped and looked at Jane and spoke, \"Sure, Seto might look like a pain sometimes, but you really don't know a person until you walk in their shoes and see it from their perspective.\"</span></div></div>",

His heart made a jump once he realized it was Jane. He then ran to her and stopped exactly a few meters before her. Jane stopped as well and for a few seconds between them there was absolute silence. Adam was the first one who broke that moment by saying \"Hheelloo Jane. How are you?\" and then Jane responded \"Hhheello to you Adam. I'm fine thanks. What about you?\" \"Me? Oh I'm all right\" Adam responded. If that was a match of \"Who is turning red faster\" it would be hard to tell who was winning, because both Adam and Jane were blushing and sweating like crazy. \"Soooo, I heard that you are about to take the promotion exam for the obelisk blue\" asked Jane red like a tomato, and Adam, who looked like he spent an entire day under a sunlamp, responded \"Oh yes, I'll take it on monday, I hope I'll pass it\" \"YOU WILL, I'M SURE OF IT\" responded Jane almost screaming with great passion in her voice. That surprised Adam, and once Jane realized what she just did she became, if it's possible, even more red. Once again there was absolute silence between them, and once again was Adam who broke that moment \"Sooooo, do you want to take a walk with me?\" Adam asked to Jane who responded \"Yes, I'd love to.\" And with that, they both started walking towards the lake. What will happen next? Both Adam and Jane felt calmer when they got to the lake and walked around the lake. No one was there and it was so peaceful. Both Jane and Adam were nervous and thinking about each other. Adam wanted to say something to his crush to Jane, and so did Jane, but they didn't want to embrass themselves. They walked around then sat down in a soft grass patch and then Jane and Adam said at the same time, \"I have something to tell you.\" Adam said, \"Do you wanna say your's first or do you want me?\" Jane thought hard and said,\"You first.\" Adam took a breath and spoke his mind, \"Jane, I think I've fallen in love with you. I know we only met yesterday, but something tells me I've known you all my life. I felt a love connection last night during the duel.\" Adam started to blush as he finished. Jane felt the impact of those words. It was exactly the same feeling that she feels for Adam, and that made her very happy. But most importantly she was glad that Adam was the first one who confessed his feelings, because now she was not afraid to confess her own feelings, not anymore. Adam, on the other hand, was still blushing, trembling and sweating. Suddenly Jane started to smile and Adam assumed the worst \"I knew it\" he screamed out loud \"I knew it I was a fool\" Jane was confused by those words \"What are you...\". \" I'm such an idiot, what could you possibly see in a guy like me? No wonder you are laughing at me\" Adam intervened \"What?\" asked Jane but then Adam said \" I'm sorry Jane, please forget what I just told you and...\" but before he could finish his sentence Jane put her hand on his mouth and said \"Ssshhh, don't be silly. You got it all wrong, I wasn't laughing, I was smiling because I feel the same for you. And I was glad you spoke first because you made all my fears disappear. What I am trying to say Adam is that I love you\" said Jane with a very sweet voice and then she moved her hand from Adam's mouth, who was pratically speechless. Once he got back his words \"Do you mean it?\" Adam asked almost not believing her. \"Let me show you\" responded Jane by approaching Adam and then she kissed him. <br>\r\nFlashback end<br>\r\n\"This is my favourite memory without a doubt\" Jane said.

A very beautiful woman stopped the clock and decided that it was time to get up. As soon as she did, she put a dressing gown  and headed for the kitchen in order o have breakfast. As she approached the kitchen, Jane started to smell the sent of coffee, and once she entered the kitchen, she noticed that a man was preparing her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are already up dear?\" Jane asked to the man<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have an important meeting later, and I cannot affort to be late\" Atticus responded by giving Jane a cup of coffee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Jane said by taking the cup and drinking a bit. Then she looked out of the gigantic window and sighed \"I can't believe that already 10 years have passed since the day when my Adam has left us\" Jane said witha very sad tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Atticus confirmed, sad as well \"It's hard to believe that your husband died in such an accident\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I have you to thank for helping deal with my grief. If it wasn't for you, who knows what I have would have done\" Jane said by looking at Atticus with puppy's eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even mention it\" Atticus said with a very conforting voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM ALIVE\" Adam screamed while entering the kitchen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me\" Atticus and Jane both whispered, while Adam approached them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you two stop playing these games so early in the morning? And you Atticus don't you have a house to return every once in a while?\" Adam said with a serious voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are not exactly games you know\" Jane whispered while puffing her cheeks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, stop acting like you are married, it creeps me out, and besides Jane you have been my wife for 16 years\" Adam continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know, in the last ten years you have been at home only a few times for month, you cannot blame me for asking my dear cousin to keep me company\" Jane said with her cheeks still puffed. After that she continued  \"Couldn't you lose a match or two Mister \"Supreme Emperor Kaiser\"? You have been undefeated for 9999 duels so far in 15 years of dueling for the Duel Monster Professional League\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam turned his serious look into a grin \"This coming form the woman who decided to build an additional room in the house in order to make a trophy room to celebrate my victories?\" Adam asked, causing Jane to blush<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... I was just tired of having all your trophies lying around the house\" Jane defended herslf<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, and what about the fact that you made an entire section dedicated to me in the hall of fame of the Duel Academy situated in Domino city?\" Adam countered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... it was a decision of the boards of directors\" Jane said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But since you are the Chancellor of the Duel Academy, doesn't that means that you proposed that?\" This time was Atticus time to speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ATTICUS\" Jane screamed as red as a tomato<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, the two of you haven't changed at all in these 16 years of marriage\" Atticus said while laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank goodness\" Jane responded smilling and with that she hugged her husband, who responded to the hug and to the smile. After that they started to kiss eachother<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really you two\" Atticus said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehi, this is our kitchen\" Jane responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so if you don't like it leave\" Adam continued and with that they went back to kissing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure. Have a nice day lovebirds\" Atticus said as she left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes Adam and Jane separated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for those silly jokes\" Jane said while blushing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry you for the screams\" Adam said blushing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that they heard somebody entering the room and noticed it  was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehi it's dad\" Alexander said with joy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow dad is at home\" Micheal said joyful as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander and Micheal Kaiser (twin brothers, 14 years old, first year, forwards of the Duel Academy soccer team, probably best freshmen duelist in the school) pratically jumped over their father happy to see that their hero was back at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehi how are my boys doing? Have you behaving good?\" Adam asked to his sons while hugging them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" both her sons responded, then their mother interviened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they are defenetly good at school, but still when they are at home they act a little bit too relaxed if you ask me, only taliking about soccer and dueling and really their manners need a lot of work\" Jane commented with a serious and amused look on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM\" Alexander and Micheal said together embarassed by what their mother just said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our mom is right\" Another female voice said \"Alex, Mich you two should act better considering who our parents are\" Sarina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina Kaiser (16 years old, eldest daughter of Jane and Adam, third year, best student for three years in a row at the Duel Academy, excellent duellist and captain of the Karate club of the Academy) entered the kitchen already in her school uniform<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarina\" Adam said with joy as soon as she saw his little princess<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning father\" Sarina said in a very elegant manner and then continued\" I am happy that you are at home, will you stay longer this time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My next duel oversea is schedued in ten days, so I'll stay home for a week\" Adam explained to her daughter while kissing her on the forehead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuppy, daddy will be with us for a week\" both Alexander and Michael screamed with joy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you two enough\" Jane said to her sons, \"Finish your breakfast and go change yourself, we cannot afford to be late today. After all your father 10.000th duel wil be host nowhere else than Duel Academy\" Jane said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT? REALLY? WE GET TO SEE DAD DUEL ON PERSON TODAY?\" The twins asked together<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course so hurry up\" Adam said to his sons, and in a matter of seconds, both Alex and Mich finished their breakfast and went preparing themselves<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two. Thank godness you are here Sarina\" Jane said by hugging her daughter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry mum, I'll always give you a hand\" Sarina responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I can count on you. We female have to be strong and help eachother\" Jane said and with that she and her daughter started to laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be too hard on them Jane. They are just young\" Adam said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but if I don't turn all my children into excellent duellists, how do you expect them to be able one day to become legends of Duel Monsters like their father is. Besides, if they'll beat you, that will mean you'll have more time for your family\" Jane joked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you ask me, it's pretty obvious from who Alex and Mich have taken their characters\" Adam joked back causing a trio of laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. Enough goofing of, time to prepare ourselves Champion\" Jane said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you command Chancellor\" Adam responded, and with that the two happy couple started having breakfast with their daughter between laughter and jokes.</span></div></div>",

In addition to the students there were also Tv staff of 25 different telivisions and almost 200 famous duelist of different Duel Leagues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HHHHEEELLLLLLLLOOOOO Duel Academy\" The announcer of the match said with his mike while entering the field and then continued \"I have to say, it's a real honor being here today, in this spectaluar place where future champions of Duel Monster are created. There are more than 50.000 person in this arena, and I'll bet that pratically the entire world of Duel Monster's fans is watching this on Tv, and can you blame them? After all, we are about to witness the 10.000 duel of a man that has never known the meaning of the word defeat since he joined the Duel Monster Professional League. If he manages to win today's match he will really be part of the history of Duel Monster. So without any further hesitation, allow me to introduce you, the one, the only, the Supreme Emperor Adam Kaiser\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer finished his speech and with that a giant smoke screen appeared on the field, and after a couple of fireworks Adam appeared on the scene, and it was in that moment that it seemed like the entire structure was about to fall. The entire crowd of 50.000 spectators got up from their seats and clapped their hands, whistled and called their champion. Pratically the entire stadium ruted for him. As soon as he entered his position, Adam was reached by the announcer who started to ask a few questions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was quite the welcome Mr Kaiser, do you want to say something to all your fan?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first like you said, I want to say thank you for that incredible welcome\" Adam responded and with that another round of applauses arrived, then Adam continued \" But still folks, let's save some of them for my opponent okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, a true gentleman, no doubt. Now, about your duel, I think we all wanted to know what surprises will you reserve us. Can you give us a few anticipations?\" The announcer continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I can say is that today, since my family will be watching me alive,  I'm not allowed to show half assed play so I will give everything I have\" Adam responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right. Your children are students of this academy, correction, best students in this academy. I guess like father like sons and daughter right?\" The announcer continued \"Speaking of which, aren't they over there?\" The announcer asked pointing to three spectators on the first row<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looked in that direction and saw his daughter and his sons who were just wavering their father<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do your best father\" Sarina screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are routing for you dad\" Michael screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Defeat your opponent daddy\" Alexander screamed as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam responded to his sons and daughter encouragments by wavering his hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my such passion. You must be very proud of your children sir\" The Announcer continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure am\" Adam responded and then continued \"but it's also thanks to their mother's hard work if they are so exceptional\" and with that the crowd started another round of applauses<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right Jane Rhodes, or rather Jane Kaiser, the chancellor of this Academy. She is entered the Dueling Pofessional World as well, but only for a short period, in order to take care of your family. And then 10 years ago, she was selected as the chancellor of this new Duel Academy. Maybe I am out of order, but I think that many persons will like to know the answer. If your wife was still a pro, will she be a threat to your title?\" The anouncer asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though she retired from the professional league, that doesn't mean she isn't strong. In fact she is one of the best,\" Adam said, but then she assumed a proud expression and said \"but no she won't be a threat to me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HEARD THAT\" a voice said from above, causing both Adam and the announcer to look up. Jane just entered the arena and heard the last part of Adam's speech so she took a mike from her seat, and responded back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak of the devil, let's ask a few quesion to Mrs Kaiser. Will you root for your husband today?\" The announcer asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane smiled and said \"Of course I route for my husband, but I'll also route for his opponent, Kevin Wetner. After all, if he manages to win, my husband will have more time to spent with his family giggle\" Jane concluded causing a round of laughs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mr Kaiser, how will you respond to this affermation by your wife?\" The announcer then asked to Adam<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Adam respond?</span></div></div>",

End this duel with Shinning Breath\" Adam ordered to his dragon, which atteacked Westner directly causing his life points to go down to zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's over. After a duel of an hour, 70 turns and almost 35 cards for deck played the winner of this incredible duel, which makes this his 10.000 victory in a rod, is the one and only SUPREME EMPEROR ADAM KAISER\" the announcer screamed at the mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a gigantic bomb exploded, the entire stadium screamed, hundreds of  students and fans got out from their seats and entered the stadium and once they got near Adam some of them took on their shoulders, screamed his name and brought in triumph for pratically the entire Duel Academy. While Adam was thanking the crowd, he saw that his sons and his daughter were still on their seats and were holding a signboard with the words<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"DAD YOU ARE THE GREATEST\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sign really moved Adam, who saluted with his hand his \"children\". After that, Adam looked up to see his wife, who was smilling at him and making a strange sign. Adam responded with a thumb up, sign that he understood what she meant, and after that he was taken outside of the stadium by the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround sunset, on the roof of the Duel Academy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was watching the sun going down on the sea, while suddenly she heard a door opening behind her. She turned around and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look who it is. Mr Legend has finally arrived. I was beginning to think that all those enthusiastic fans made you forget our appointment\" Jane said to Adam jokingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that will ever happen\" Adam responded with the same tone, and then reached his wife and hugged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulation on your 10.000 victory champion.\" Jane said and then continued \"Here is your reward \" and with that she gave Adam a very long and passionate kiss. Afer about five minutes they separeted eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At what number of kisses on this roof  are we?\" Adam asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think 1734\" Jane said while giggling. After that they both looked at the sunset<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can almost grab the sun with your hand here right?\" Adam said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Jane responded  \"And the ocean makes you feel calm and relaxed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but the best part is staying here with you\" Adam continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay enough with these\" Jane concluded, surprising Adam \" We are not teenager anymore afterall\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. as if we had grown up since those days\" Adam said \"Don't you think I know that you choose this place because you hope to see our old school from here\" Adam finished with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah Mr wiseguy, and what about you? You were the one who decided on this date after dueling back when we started dating in school\" Jane responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam and Jane looked at eachother and then laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you miss those days?\" Adam asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, but you know what. I really like the present that I'm living\" Jane responded with a big smile on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same goes for me\" Adam said and with that they kissed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the future seems to be very promising\" Jane continued once they separated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of future\" Adam said \" I heard that they are about to create a new era of Dueling. Dueling on motorcycle\" Adam said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Jane asked surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so what do you say Miss Chancelor are you still up for a ride?\" Adam asked to her wife with a grin on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful Adam, when you play with Mrs Kaiser you are going to get burnt\" Jane said with an intimidating voice but a big smile on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Adam asked and continued \"Then let's see how much hot you can be\". And after that the two started to play a little game of catch me if you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on we have to go now. The Others are waiting\" Jane said when she stopped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know that the stars deserve a 15 minutes break?\" Adam asked while laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Mr Star let's go\" Jane said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By your command ny queen\" Adam responded and with that he took her wife arm in arm and returned in the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam and Jane continue their life as duelists and as a couple together with their friends and family.

She walked for a good 10 minutes, and during every single step on the way her mind was full of these questions \" Oh man, what should I say to him when I saw him? What are we going to do? What is he going to say when he'll see me dress like this? Oh why did I let Mindy and Jasmine trapped me into this situation? It's true that I wanted to have a date with him, but what if I'm not ready?What if I say something really stupid to him? Oh no! What if he suddenly got some pervert instinct when he'll see me? I mean, he is a man, and I am a woman and these thing can happen between a man and a woman.\" But that was too much. Jane suddenly stopped and screamed \"WHY AM I SO NERVOUS? WHY CAN I BE AS CALM AS I AM DURING A DUEL?\". After that she took 10 deep breaths and calmed down. Then she restarted walking. About two minutes to 20.00, Jane arrived at the date location, and then she heard a voice coming from behind her. \"Oh my.

I was in pressbox, since my father worked for Seto Kaiba and brought me along to watch the match. Mobuka and I watched the duel and saw everything. But then I heard something from my deck, a roar, but not a loud one. I checked my card and saw it was my Decoy Dragon, and it then appeared next to me and rub his head on my leg like a household cat. I was kinda scared but that was just one incident, they're many times of when I saw my cards talk to me and their spirts. But that night, gave a passion for dueling others. After the match, Seto was congratulated by his board, even though he lost, but he gave my father a card and nodded and walked out without saying a word. My father gave me the card and I didn't know what to say, what I realized that card was Seto's most feared monster, A Blue-Eyes White Dragon, which also spoke to me.\" Adam stopped and then said, \"Sorry, I must be rambling like a mad man, but Jane, the reason you see your monsters and I see mine are because you believe in your cards, just like Yugi. </span></div></div>",

He had black spiked hair, blue eyes, and a good smile.

You're always looking out for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that's what friends do.  You've helped me out a few times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Alexis quick question.  Where did you get that really powerful spell... what was it called... Girl's World?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I found it on the-\"  Just then Alexis was interrupted by the five minute warning bell.  The two only had a few short minutes before they would be late for class.  \"I'll tell you later, but we have to get to class now.\"  Alexis then grabbed Jaden's hand and pulled him straight to class, not noticing how Jaden's hands were softer than they usually were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to Jaden during class?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alexis and Jaden barely slipped into class in time for the starting bell.  Jaden was just hitting his seat when he heard an all to familiar pen tapping the front of his desk.  Looking up, Jaden saw the fat lips and gaudy outfit wearing teacher that is Professor Crowler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Yuki, nice to see you actually in your chair when the bell rings instead of worming your way into your chair far after class has started,\" began the bonde, ponytailed teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I've been in class plenty of times before the bell,\" countered Jaden.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you have... Anyway I have more important things to do then lecture a slacker Slipher about class times,\" spoke Crowler as he returned to his podium.  \"Today class we'll be continuing the lecture from last time, the different forms of trap cards and how to counter them.\"  With that, the class settled into its usual routine of Crowler taking what felt like 30 minutes what several picked up with a few hands of Duel Monsters.  Honestly for Alexis and Jaden to some extent it was very understandable.  Even still Alexis took notes like she always did except for the occasional drawing she would start whenever Crowler was discussing something other than Duel Monsters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs part of Jaden's usual routine, Jaden decided to get comfortable.  That meant slouching in his chair till it was just right, a quick button of his coat to keep him warm, and the slipping off of his boots.  Jaden didn't know when exactly or why, but he always preferred resting or even just sitting even if it was only for a few minutes with his shoes off.  Jaden quickly slipped off his right boot first though in the process it nearly took off his sock.  He quietly admitted to himself that he might need to buy a larger pair soon.  After adjusting his right sock, he slipped off his left shoe, his two black socked feet free once again.  With that done, Jaden set in for a typical Crowler lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile time passed, Alexis taking notes with the occasional note doodle and Jaden resting more than listening, the power of the Girl's World card began to move inside Jaden.  Whether distracted by his own doings or through the droning on of Crowler, Jaden failed to notice a number of small changes through out his body.  Starting with Jaden's hair, it gained a light sheen as his he had used a conditioner of some kind.  It also gained a small amount of length to give him a slightly more feminine style.  Jaden lost a few inches in height as well putting his line of sight to just about Alexis's forehead as opposed to over it.  Jaden also lost any sort of body hair, especially on his legs which also lost a touch of their muscle mass and definition.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the bell sounding the end of class rang and several noted ran out the door before it was finished despite Crowler's pleads.  Jaden yawned himself awake and quickly prepared to leave.  However, just as Jaden stood up he noticed his boots felt kind of large on him.  A quick gaging of his boots revealed a noticeable difference between when class started to now.  However, Jaden was too distracted by his next activity, lunch, to really care.  With the note about his boots filed away for later Jaden approached Alexis and asked, \"Hey Alexis wanna have lunch together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised by the sudden invitation, Alexis said yes and soon the two were off to lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

After lunch Jaden hurried to the bathroom while Alexis was waiting for him to be done with his \"business\". When Jaden reached for the sink to wash his hands his chest started aching while his stomach rumbled. Jaden said in a \"surfer dude\" voice \"No biggy!\" but that changed when the aching pushed him against the wall. Jaden screamed in real pain while his chest pulsated. Two small plump breasts popped from his chest. His nipples grew tender and sharper. His new breasts grew larger and larger and grew into D size breasts. His hands started shaking and grew smaller as well as his arms and legs. His nails grew and turned pink. His ass startles swelling up and grew rounder and plumper. His lips turned Slifer red. and cheeks grew smaller and hair growing longer. Jaden asked \"What's happening?\" in a voice that doesn't even sound like his own. His penis pulsates and his heart beats. His penis was shrinking and formed a vagina. Jaden couldn't show him or herself like this or could she. Jaden thought about the consequences and she made her decision....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jaden and Alexis quickly made their way to the cafeteria.  Duel Academy's Cafeteria had a reputation for being world renowned.  Several different chefs from all across the globe worked in the kitchen, providing students with healthy, delicious meals, desserts, snacks, everything imaginable.  The cafeteria room itself was nothing to scoff at either.  Large floor to ceiling windows let in plenty of light.  Sitting arrangements ranged from simple table and chairs, to comfortable booths complete with comfortable cushions, to the Obliesk Blue Lounge which was seemed to be a cross between a traditional smoking room and a pile of pillows, though that was reserved for those in the Obelisk dorm.  There was also the covered roof though it was one of the lesser chosen options as the blankets Duel Academy provided were not the softest and the roof tended to be rather windy at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jaden normally would just stride over to the sandwich corner and pull a couple of cold sandwiches from the refrigerated shelves, he found himself more interested in finding something a bit more healthy.  Looking through the options, Jaden soon found himself in a rather long line.  And while at first he was annoyed as his growling stomach protested, he soon realized he was actually standing right next to Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alexis, so you thinking Spaghetti and Meatballs as well?\" asked Jaden with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a few meatballs, but I'm thinking I'll mainly have a salad,\" answered Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, come on.  This isn't another diet or some sort of health thing is it?\" asked Jaden.  \"I mean, you look fine to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis blushed slightly though she didn't know whether it was out of embarrassment for having to admit she was watching her figure or that Jaden had noticed.  \"Well... it is a bit of a diet, just trying to watch my calories.  Besides, if I get a salad, that means I don't have to feel guilty about taking one of those oversized chocolate chip cookies.\"  Jaden looked past Alexis and sure enough at the far end near the register was a stack of large, cookies, each one almost as big as a folded up duel-disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always thinking ahead Alexis.  I might just follow your lead,\" responded Jaden with a quick smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends got to talking and were soon discussing strategies, funny internet videos, and just talking.  To Alexis it felt strange to have Jaden talking this much to her.  He always seemed to have Cyrus or Hasselberry by his side.  However, she welcomed the strangeness, soon finding it rather a joy.  She soon found herself talking far more openly with Jaden than she ever had before.  Jaden, while having always seen Alexis as a friend and great duelist, began to realize how much he liked talking with her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this waiting period, Jaden continued to change physically.  Jaden lost a few more inches in height, now the exact same height as Alexis.  His hair continued to grow out as well, becoming much more feminine. and now reaching down to halfway down his neck.  Jaden's hands slimmed, still masculine, but definitely softer.  The young man's butt and hips swelled slightly, his pants stretching to accommodate the now more feminine behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Alexis's example, Jaden did add a salad to his lunch.  In fact, Jaden started walking to the register and realized he'd actually nearly completely forgotten to grab any meatballs or spaghetti.  After quickly fixing that, Jaden was sure to grab two cookies, paid for his lunch and joined Alexis on the other end of the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" began Jaden as he joined Alexis, \"Where do you want to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis looked around.  \"Cafeteria seems pretty crowded today.  How about the roof?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"  Jaden and Alexis began to climb the stairs.  As Jaden made his way up the second flight of stairs to the roof, Jaden barely heard a small thud and then felt something cold on his foot.  Looking down, Jaden was surprised to find his right boot had fallen off and now lay two steps behind him.  Jaden quickly went after the boot and tried to use his socked foot to right it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden, everything okay?\" called Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my boot just fell off, I don't know how,\" answered Jaden, still struggling to get his foot back in the suddenly too big boot.  After a few more tries, Jaden decided to stop playing around.  He slipped his left boot off and picked up both boots.  Reaching the top of the stairs, Jaden was about to try again with his boots, when he noticed Alexis was standing, holding the door to the outside.  The thing that caught Jaden's attention was that Alexis had apparently discarded her boots as well, revealing a pair of simple white ankle socks with a slight light blue to the toe.  Jaden smiled and went out onto the rooftop, completely unaware of how much their relationship and world was about to change.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaden and Alexis stepped out onto the Roof.  The Roof was not the actual roof of Duel Academy's Cafeteria.  However, the area was so high up that some student long ago must have felt they were close enough, and the nickname stuck.  The eating area itself was nice.  Essentially divided into two areas, shaded and not shaded, students had almost as much choice of where to sit as in the Cafeteria proper.  The shaded section boasted several simple tables, some blocked off by planters allowing for privacy when students wished for it.  The non-shaded section boasted far fewer tables and a number of benches for students to use.  However, the major reason students came here were for the grand views and the picnic option.  For just a dollar, students were able to rent a blanket and use it until they returned it.  Granted these blankets were often not as comfy as some would prefer, but some of the blankets were perfect.  And even though Jaden and Alexis had not even sat down, one look at the blanket and Jaden knew he was lucky.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping his boots by the side of the blanket, Jaden took a seat on the blanket which quickly turned into laying down.  The blanket was essentially a down quilt, impressively soft, with enough cushioning that those who wanted could outright sleep on it without a pillow.  Alexis joined Jaden on the blanket, though she resisted the urge to lay down as well.  \"Better hurry Jaden or your food will get cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawh~!\" cried the young man as he sat up like a rocket.  \"That would be horrible!\"  Jaden paused for a moment, trying to sell his worry.  Alexis soon burst into laughter, being caught off guard by the unexpected joke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Alexis and Jaden stopped laughing, the two set about with their lunch idly chatting as they ate.  As the two ate, Jaden's physical changes continued.  His hips and butt finished expanding, reaching about the same size as Alexis, which strained Jaden's pants.  Jaden no doubt would have tried to adjust his pants had his waist not shrunken in, giving him the beginnings of an hourglass figure.  Jaden's arms lost some muscle and began their transition to feminine.  By the time Jaden was done scarfing down the last of his main course, Jaden's hair was down to his shoulders and was starting to get in his face a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing his hair aside, Jaden muttered mostly to himself, \"Why is my hair being so... annoying today.  Maybe I should've gotten that haircut the other day.\"  Jaden nor Alexis noticed Jaden's voice sounded a little higher than usual.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Jaden in distress, Alexis pulled out a small bag and pulled out something, Jaden couldn't really see.  \"Jaden,\" stated Alexis as she turned her seating position towards Jaden.  \"Look at me.\"  Following the request, Jaden watched as Alexis's hands flew to the sides of his head.  He heard two quick snaps and Alexis retracted her hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden was about to object when he noticed that his hair was out of his face.  He turned to face Alexis who was now holding a small mirror.  In the mirror he saw his normal face, a handsome, yet soft face of a kind, brave, fun-loving soul, whose long hair had been curtailed by two light pink hairclips.  Jaden was about to object, but the more he looked at the clips, the more he liked them.  \"Thanks Alexis, these are... really,\" Jaden wanted to say cute, but resisted.  \"Helpful.  I owe you one for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't have to,\" answered Alexis with a slight blush.  \"I've had those clips in my bag for a while, my aunt gave them to me and I've never used them.\"  Alexis, turned her face away, not wanting to show off her blush.  Looking down, Alexis noticed that her altered seating position actually exposed some her underwear to Jaden.  Before Alexis could be embarrassed, she was surprised to find herself thinking how annoyed she was that Jaden was not blushing as well.  Yet, why should he be embarrassed to see her undergarments.  They were friends after all.  Though not entirely solid, the thoughts were strong enough to hold Alexis's deeper suspicions away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping her finger to her lip, Alexis noted that her lips were a little chapped and quickly turned to her bag.  Within seconds, Alexis found a small container and flipped it open, applying the healing balm to her lips.  \"Hey Alexis, what is that?\" asked Jaden, his feet now crossed in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just lip balm. Cherry Flavored, would you like some?\" offered Alexis, as she extended the container to Jaden.  Jaden swiped his finger in the medicinal goo and came away with a glob that Alexis knew would be too much.  However, Jaden did his best to apply the medicine and while he did not make a mess of it, clearly Jaden had never done this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tastes pretty good,\" offered Jaden with a smack, \"I've never really been good with this make up stuff.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure if you were to practice it once in a while you'd figure it all out, just like dueling,\" stated Alexis.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm not really built to be... pretty,\" stated Jaden.  \"We guys have to dashing and handsome all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all the time,\" replied Alexis, \"People should just focus on being who they are and who they eventually want to be instead of trying to please everyone.  Besides, I'm sure you would look very pretty with just the right make up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" stated Jaden with the tone of a challenge.  \"I don't know, Alexis. I'm Jaden Yuki, quite the manly stud.  Your paltry makeup will have no effect on this handsome face.\"  Jaden's tone was clearly joking and to exaggerate his statement, Jaden flexed his dainty arms.  Alexis nearly broke out in a laugh, which forced her to spread her legs wide, further exposing herself to Jaden.  However, Alexis maintained control of the laugh, calmed herself, and dove once more into the bag.  Producing lipstick, concealer, eyeliner, and many more perfect-for-a-purse sized containers of makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you scoot over here and find out?\" stated Alexis as she picked up the challenge.  Without hesitation, Jaden moved himself over to Alexis and presented his face to her.  The blond haired girl quickly got to work, applying eyeliner, shading over any blemishes, working her magic with makeup.  Throughout the process, Jaden's face seemed to mold with Alexis's deft touch and makeup application.  His cheeks grew soft, his lips puffed slightly, his eyes grew wide and kind.  Slowly with each pat of makeup and each push of a brush, Jaden's face was transformed from that of a young, hyperactive male, to that of a calm, yet energetic young woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished, Alexis smiled at her work.  \"See, now if you just practice,\" offered Alexis, not even noticing that her very motivation for doing the makeup had changed, \"I am sure you could master this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Alexis,\" answered Jaden in a more feminine tone, \"You're just so much better at it than me.  You know just how to make me,... well, me.  Anyway, thanks again for the help.  Tell you what, I'll take your next test for you, as payment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the offer, but I'd rather just pass if you don't mind,\" countered Alexis with a giggle.  Jaden blushed before giving Alexis a quick, playful shove.  Alexis let the playful shove take her and she landed with a plop on the quilt, hardly caring that her skirt had come undone and Jaden could now see everything.  And why should it matter thought Alexis, stopping her hands as they went to cover herself.  They were both girls... no they weren't Jaden was a boy... but she was also a good... had she just referred to Jaden as a she... why not, after all he was a-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Alexis,\" interrupted Jaden.  Alexis turned to see Jaden blushing slightly.  \"You are kind of exposed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis, surprisingly annoyed, slowly stood up and secured her skirt the best she could.  Even still, the skirt had lost a button along the way and now barely hung on her hips.  Alexis and Jaden then sat down and continued to eat their lunch, unaware just how far the changes had already progressed.</span></div></div>",

The machine had hearts in its eyes as Syrus watched in confusion.Blair was giggling to herself before explaining what was going on. \"Sorry Syrus, but Maiden  in love cannot be destroyed in attack mode, and after she battles, the battling monster gains a maiden counter.\"   Syrus placed one face down card as well before leaving it  back to Blair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to really show my stuff. I summon white magician pikeru in attack mode (1200). Then I will equip my beautiful maiden with Cupid's kiss. She gains 500 attack (400-&gt;900) and is even more irresistible now. I will now have Maiden in love attack your drillroid.\" Maiden in love ran towards drillroid before falling over in front of it (2800-&gt;2100). Syrus was again baffled by why she did that, before seeing drillroid help Maiden in love up and join it's side. \"Looks like your monster is in love Syrus, forgot to tell you, but if a monster with Cupids kiss battles a monster with a maiden counter, than I can take control of it. Well it's time for my new drillroid to attack you directly.\" Drillroid prepared to attack Syrus, but he had a backup plan. \"That won't work! I can discard Kiteroid from my hand to negate a direct attack. \" Syrus was able to avoid one attack, though Blair hit him with pikeru afterwards (4000-&gt;2800). With that Blair ended her turn while giving Syrus a mocking smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus didn't have much in terms of options, but if he could buy a turn then maybe it could go right for him. \"Alright, I summon Steamroid in attack mode (1800) and will have him destroy Steamroid.\" Syrus hoped to bring his destroyed monster back with his face down card and then he would be able to destroy another monster. \"My steamroid gains 500 attack points when it's the one attacking.\" Blair wasn't worried at all as she activated her face down card. \"A silly boy can't outsmart my pretty maiden, I activate the face down Defense Maiden so if you attack one of my monster it always goes to Maiden in love!\" Syrus gasped as Trainroid rammed into Maiden in love.

I activate the trap cyber summon blaster, and then use my other face down call of the haunted. I can bring back my kiteroid and cyber summon blaster hits you for 400 each time a machine is speical summoned.\" Syrus was hopeful to finish the duel and was surprised to see Blair activate a trap of her own.. \"I won't lose here. I use my pikeru circle of enchantment to negate all effect I take this turn.\" Syrus was dejected to see his plan fail and watch as Blair gains even more life points from Pikeru. \"It's over Syrus, first I summon ebon black curran and will have it and pikeru destroy your monster. Now you can't avoid this attack. Maiden in love will show you that girl's are just better.\" Maiden in love skipped over to Syrus and embraced him.

Even so she thought the duel against Syrus would lead to beneficial to her curiosity of seeing Syrus as a female, part of her didn't want to hurt Jaden's best friend. From Syrus's point of view, he was wondering what was taking Blair so long, she had the game pretty much wrapped up here. Blair had to make a very serious choice here to either change her fellow Slifer Red neighbor or leave him be. Blair could feel a strange feeling about the card and chose not to play it, finally breaking her silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This duel is over, Syrus.

(500 -&gt; 0)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duel field faded away and Blair walked over towards Syrus to help him up as she quickly put her hand back into her deck, and giving him a kind smile as she hoped that she did the right thing in not changing him. \"Thanks for the duel, Syrus... Sorry if I went to aggressive on you.\" Syrus smiled and responded, \"Welcome, and you did fine Blair.\" With that, Syrus wentry back upstairs to his and Jaden's dorm room leaving Blair by herself as she then heard a voice speak to her, \"That was a very kind decision you made to your friend, Blair.\" Shocked by the voice, Blair looked around but saw nothing until she saw a spirit appear next to her, looking very elegant as she looked at the young thirteen year old Silver Red. Blair then asked who the spirt was, and the spirit answered, \"I am the Spirit of the Girl's World card that you now own, Blair. If you would of activated the card and defeated your friend, I would of appeared and changed him into what you desired him to become. But, since you didn't play it, I wanted you to know that I existed and will offer my advice if you want it.\" With that, she disappeared as the sun began to set over the Duel Academy. Blair then went into her dorm room and began to ponder over what she had just heard.</span></div></div>",

The Ra Yellow was a boy named Adam Kaiser, a normal kid from Domino City, he's probobly one the nicest people you can meet, but he doesn't like it when people target his friends. He has a love for dueling and a spirit monster. He had same type of field and also had a monster card, which was his spirit monster, Decoy Dragon.

Jasmine said, \"Reggie was dueling a Ra Yellow and lost, He looked kinda cute.\" Mindy, who was like Jasmine in every way, wanted to know who the boy was while Alexis looked like she was about to get a headache but then Alexis asked, \"What card did she find?\" Jasmine shrugged and said she didn't know. Alexis then got up and said, \"If you don't know, then let's find out.\" The girls followed Alexis to her room and went to her computer while Jasmine pulled out the card and finally saw the name of the card, \"Girl's World\", it was a field spell card that only can be played by women. It ability increase the female duelist monsters by 500 attack points, but also if she duels a male duelist, their monsters lose 500 attack points. But also if the male loses the duel, He is turned into a female unless the card holder changes her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls were shocked when they looked at the card's ability and after they tried searching for it, it said no data found. Alexis spoke, \"Is this some sort of joke?\" Mindy was confused why Jasmine found a card that's not even found in the  database of duel monsters. Jasmine was thinking, \"Maybe the Ra Yellow knows something about the card.\" She takes the card and puts it in her deck again and then walked towards the door. Mindy said, \"Where are you going, Jasmine?\" Jasmine answered, \"I'm going to see if I can find any info on this card.\" Jasmine then left the room and then the dorm and started to head back to the academy to find Adam.

Dexter and Patty were excited to see mostly some rare and some old cards. Dexter then asked Issac, \"Why do you have so many old cards, some of these cards are from when Duel Monsters began?\" Isaac smiled and placed his deck back into the pocket and clipped back to his pants and then spoke, \"Some of these cards are from my father, a very wise and respectable man, he was top of his class in his Duel Academy, along with mom, he gave me some of his cards because he knew I would treat them with the same respect as he did.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Patty then asked, So, what would be your top card, Issac?\" Issac then asked her to explain. Patty countinued, \"What card are you mostly know for?

Then Issac spoke, \"My deck is very hard just to pick one favorite. Each card has a story to me and they've all saved me. But I would only know one I've used so many times, he's helped me through most of my duels and got me out of tough scrapes, it would have to be this one.\" Issac pulled out his side deck and picked the top one.

I\u2019m starting off with my field spell Sogen\u201d said Dexter placing the field spell in his duel disk instantly the terrain around two duelists was transformed into a large meadow. \u201cHere all my warrior monsters gain 200 attack and defense points so you better watch out\u201d said Dexter. \u201cNow I summon Marauding Captain!\u201d he announced as his young, blonde, armor clad warrior appeared sporting 1200 attack points and 400 defense points which instantly rise to 1400 and 600. \u201cAnd thanks to my captain\u2019s ability I can play another warrior from my hand so I summon Command Knight\u201d he announced as yet another warrior with less traditional armor then the captain appeared with 1400 attack and 1900 defense points  which rose to 1600 and 2100. \u201cAnd now for his little trick, all my warrior monsters gain 400 more attack points!\u201d said Dexter, Marauding Captains points rise to 1800 and Command knights to 2000. \u201cOk Captain take out her little fairy\u201d said Dexter.

Dexter knew where this was going \u201cI tune level one Pixie with level three Ballerina and Master\u201d said Luna as her tuner monster surrounded the other two in a green ring and the other two became six balls of light (1+3+3=7) \u201cI give you the majestic, the wise, the powerful, the Ancient Fairy Dragon!\u201d said Luna as her signer dragon a large and blue serpent dragon with long minty hair and silvery butterfly wings appeared with 2100 attack points and 3000 defense points. \u201cNow since my dragon is a light creature I gain 1000 life points because I used Sunny Pixie to summon it\u201d said Luna. \u201cNow before my creature wipes the field with your little warriors she\u2019ll activate her special ability to change up the scenery\u201d said Luna as Ancient Fairy Dragon radiated a powerful light which destroyed the Sogen spell \u201cand now I gain 1000 more life points and I get to add one field spell from my deck to my hand\u201d said Luna as she reached into her deck and took her key card. \u201cNow I activate Girl World\u201d said Luna, now the two duelists were battling a top a fashion runway surrounded by dolls, dresses, make up, flowers, and everything stereotypical of girls and females. \u201cNow here girls rule and boys drool because all female card gain 500 attack and defense points while all male monsters give up 500 attack and defense points\u201d said Luna.

Gilford\u2019s points dropped to 2100 and 1500.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter because I play Sword of Dragon\u2019s Soul!\u201d said Dexter playing an equip spell \u201cthis card raises my monster\u2019s points by 700 and if he battles a dragon it\u2019s destroyed at the end of the battle phase so even if you save your dragon with one of those face-downs she\u2019s toast!\u201d said Dexter. Gilford\u2019s points go to 2800. \u201cOk Gilford my man, slay that dragon!\u201d said Dexter Gilford leapt at his master\u2019s command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI play a spell card, Flattery\u201d said Luna flipping over a quick play spell picturing a young maiden watching a warrior flex his muscles \u201chere\u2019s how it works one of us draws a card and then the other is going to take 500 points of damage for every card the drawer holds, oh and another thing Dexter you pick which one of us draws\u201d said Luna. Dexter looked at his own hand currently he was holding just one card so if he drew Luna would only take 1000 points of damage because of flattery however with his warrior closing in on Ancient Fairy Dragon she\u2019d take another 200 points of damage leaving her with 4800 and while that\u2019s still twice more than his points he\u2019d still have Gilford to widdle down her points next round, on the other hand Luna was currently holding one so if she drew she\u2019d have a total of two which would leave him with only 1300 points but still Gilford would destroy Ancient leaving Luna with 5800 life points. Dexter went over the scenarios as fast as he could but couldn't see what Luna was hoping to gain from all this, was she hopping he\u2019d let her draw and she\u2019d pull a game changer? \u201cOh I almost forgot to mention Dexter, if you call off your Gilford\u2019s attack neither of us draws\u201d said Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I get it\u201d thought Dexter \u201cshe\u2019s hoping I\u2019ll play it safe and call off my attack then she can put her dragon in defense mode on her turn, then to take it out I would have to take 700 points of damage to destroy that dragon\u201d Dexter said to himself. \u201cLooks like the only way out of this, is to destroy Ancient now and make Luna take the damage from Flattery\u201d Dexter thought. \u201cI\u2019ll draw\u201d said Dexter picking up his card, instantly Luna\u2019s flattery card began glowing red and Luna took 1000 points of damage. \u201cSorry Luna your little plan to get me to chicken out didn\u2019t work\u201d said Dexter \u201cnow Gilford slay that dragon\u201d he said his voice beaming with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like a boy\u201d said Luna \u201ccouldn\u2019t wait to destroy my dragon next turn so you continue on and let me take the damage\u201d she went on \u201cit\u2019s ironic because if you\u2019d taken the damage yourself you would\u2019ve been around to see another turn, I reveal my other face down, Abused Maiden Hits Back\u201d Luna announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trapped that flipped over pictured a young girl with scars on her body charging at a warrior \u201cwhat on Earth is that?\u201d asked Dexter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna giggled \u201cit\u2019s quite the handy card, it can only let out its power when I take effect damage\u201d she announced at that moment Dexter knew why Luna played Flattery \u201cthank you by the way Dexter because now one female monster on my field gains attack points equal to its defense point!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay what?\u201d said Dexter shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAncient Fairy Dragon let out a mighty roar at Gilford the Legend as her attack points rose from 2600 to 6100! \u201cAncient Fairy Dragon \u201cattack and end this duel\u201d Luna ordered. Ancient Fairy Dragon let out a burst of light which destroys Gilford the Legend and causes Dexter to take 3300 life points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna: 5000<br>\r\nDexter: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDexter fell to his knees defeated \u201cgreat duel Luna you\u2019ve really upped your game\u201d he said, that\u2019s when he noticed that Girl World was still on the field! \u201cYour field spell, but all the holograms should\u2019ve vanished now that the duels done\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna giggled again \u201cwhoever said it was a hologram?\u201d she asked simply. \u201cYou know Dexter you really are a smart boy, but you know nothing about how hard it is to be a girl, how society really treats us, and how much one little prank can cost us\u201d said Luna loudly but then she smiled and added \u201cyet.\u201d Suddenly Dexter was surrounded in a dome of pink smoke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in duel PE the last of the duels were just starting to wind down and Leo was just about to finish off his latest opponent when suddenly there was a high-pitched scream, everyone started to run for the door. \u201cHey where\u2019s everyone going?\u201d asked Leo as his class his opponent included ran for the hall to find the screams source \u201cah man I had this guy on the ropes\u201d said Leo before taking off after his class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the hall way there was only one brown haired child but no blue haired girl to be seen, she lay amongst a series of warrior cards which were scattered amongst the floor, she was wearing a blue boys uniform which looked a little big on her, her hair had grown since her transformation, her shirt was now budging out with new seedling breasts taking credit, and her skin was now much softer. However Leo recognized the cards on the floor and the glasses on this girls face could be no coincidence. \u201cDex is that you?\u201d asked Leo not knowing if he was going to like the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is\u201d said Dexter practically crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho did this to you?\u201d asked Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d said Dexter.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dexter was shocked to see this new face to him actually stop a duel, buf it was short-lived by Luna's retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who may you the king of games, we are in a middle of a duel, and I intend to finish it.\" Luna glared at the upper class boy, but all he did was smiled and turned around, saying, \"You have no idea how much power that one little card has in it, Luna. It is one with great consequences if used\u00a0in a\u00a0state of anger or rage. Think about that next time you challenge your brother's best friend.\" As the upper class boy left,  both duel disks started to malfunction and turned themselves off as the monsters vanished in the sight of the watchers, saying to themselves, \"Who was that?\" Luna was furious and chased after the upper class boy as she cut around the corner and ran into a familiar kid from earlier in class, the one who came in almost late and sat behind Patty and was very silent, but paid very great attention as he acted more mature than his 13 year old self, but fell over when Luna knocked him over. The boy was already shy enough since it was his first week, even though he was wearing no red tie as well, he was still very shy and didnt look at Luna.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sherry LeBlanc was wandering around Neo Domino City thinking about who to recruit for her team. She needed to gather a team together for the Grand Prix so she could face off against Yliaster to get revenge for her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought what to do she was blinded by a bright light, and when it was gone there was a card left in its place. Sherry picked up the card which was a field spell called GIRLS WORLD:\"This card can only be activated by a female duelist. If this card is activated female gender monsters gain 500 attack and defense points and cannot be destroyed in battle, while male gender monsters lose 500 attack and defense points. Once activated this card cannot be destroyed. If your opponent is a male duelist, if he loses the duel, this card will change him into a female duelist\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interested in the card that she found. Sherry figured that she could try it out on a male duelist and maybe she could use it to recruit members for her team.  Her victim was going to be Yusei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry found him at his teams garage and arranged a duel with him.  Sherry smiled as she started off the duel confident that she was going to win. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew her first card and summoned her first monster. \" I summon Horse of the Floral Knights in defense position, and when I summon it I can draw 1 card. Next I will place two face down cards and end my turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Yusei's turn, \"I send my Quillbolt hedgehog from my hand to the graveyard in order to summon quickdraw synchron in defense position. My next move is to summon speed warrior in attack position (900). I will then tune my quickdraw synchron with my speed warrior in order to synchro summon Junk Archer (2300). I then use Junk Archer's effect to banish one of your monsters til the end of the turn. Junk Archer fired an arrow which hit Horse of the Floral Knights and it disappeared into the void. Then Junk Archer began its attack on Sherry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, I activate my trap card Floral shield which negates your attack and I get to draw another card.\" Sherry said. She smiled as the card she drew was GIRLS WORLD which she could use next turn.\"I place one face down card and end my turn\" Yusei said as Horse of the Floral Knights returned to the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry could finally try out her new card as she drew from her deck. \" I summon Sacred Knight Joan to the field in attack position (1900). Then I activate the field spell card GIRLS WORLD.\" The land around the duelists became pink as they were surrounded with dresses, dolls, shoes, makeup, and everything girly. As Yusei stood in shock of his new surroundings, Sherry explained the effects of the card. \"This card reduces the attack and defense of all male monsters by 500 points, while female monster gain 500 attack and defense alongside being immune to destruction by battle. Yusei was in awe of the powerful card he faced. With GIRLS WORLD active Joan had enough attack points in order to destroy Junk Archer. \"When Joan attacks she loses 300 attack points for the battle so you take 300 points of damage.\" With that Sherry ended her turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s not over yet, I summon my Junk Synchron in attack mode and his ability lets me summon a level 2 or lower monster from my graveyard in defense mode. I bring back my speed warrior, and since a turner in on the field I can summon my Quillbolt hedgehog to the field. I then tune my Junk synchron to my quilbolt hedgehog to synchro summon Junk warrior (2300). He may lose 500 attack points due to GIRLS WORLD, but he gains 400 thanks to speed warrior. I then equip lightning blade to him to give him another 800 attack boost and attack your Sacred Knight Joan.\" Junk Warrior rushed forwardd and punched Joan dealing 600 points of damage although Joan was safe due to GIRLS WORLD. Yusei placed another card face down and then it was Sherrys turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will end this duel this turn\" Sherry said with confidence. \u201cI summon necro fleur in defense mode and activate the spell card fleur switch. I destroy my necro fleur and summon fleur synchron from my deck to the field and I get to increase the level of Horse of the Floral Knights by 1. Also when necro fleur is destroyed by a card effect I can summon Sorciere de fleur to the field (2800+500), and when she is summoned I can summon one of your monsters from the graveyard to my side of the field. I bring out your speed warrior over to my side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei couldn't believe that Sherry had already summoned 4 monsters in one turn although she wasn't done yet. \u201cMy next move is to use speed warrior, Horse of the Floral Knights, and fleur synchron to synchro summon Chevelier de fleur onto the field (2700+500). Plus when fleur synchron is used for a synchro summon I can summon a level 2 or lower monster from my hand, and I pick another fleur synchron.\" Now it was time for Sherry to begin her attack and she started with her Sorciere de fluer. It attacked Junk warrior as Yusei tried to defend it by activating his trap card scrapmetal scarecrow, but Chevalier de fluer has the ability to negate a spell/trap card once per turn. The attack continued as Yusei lost 300 more life points. Next fleur syncron attacked Yusei followed by the finishing blow from Chevelier de fleur. Sherry was excited to see the effects of winning the duel on Yusei. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei accepted his defeat while not knowing that he was beginning to change from GIRLS WORLD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What did he start to change into?</span></div></div>",
