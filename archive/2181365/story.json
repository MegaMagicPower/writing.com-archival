Do you wish to continue? I shall warn you, there will be a cost.\u201d The man said. You nodded with confidence, making him sigh. The stranger then suddenly handed you a plant, one you had never seen before. \u201cAdd this to the potion, and you will succeed. But remember my warning.\u201d The stranger said before turning to leave. You looked at your project and started to turn back to the man when you suddenly realized he had vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook it off, but used the plant he gave you. Within a few minutes, your potion changed to a different color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if he\u2019s right then this should make me stronger. But\u2026how did he even know about my project? I only told my teacher and family, and even then I told them to keep it a secret.\u201d You asked yourself quietly. You shrugged it off and took the potion. Though nothing happened, you figured you would feel the effects later. You turned to leave the room.</span></div></div>",
