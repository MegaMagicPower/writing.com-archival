Immediately the pressurized canister flies against the wall, spewing out a gray gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to go,\" your father says to you. You stare at the canister for a second, thinking how unusual it seemed. Then, you follow your father to the stairs, where he was calling for Bronson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fumes from the canister act fast. They weren't really meant to kill the invading insects in your home. As you would soon discover, the chemical actually had the capability of shrinking humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither you nor your father see Bronson again before you both pass out from the fumes. Next to each other, you two tumble to the floor at the foot of the stairs--gradually shrinking to just one inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** ** *** ** ***</div><br>\r\nYou wake up to your father shaking you. Your head hurts, and you immediately clutch your temples. The world seems so bright, and as your vision focuses, you are not able understand what is going on or where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you're awake,\" Dad says, turning away from you and looking around. You finally start to notice where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, everything in your house is seemingly dozens of times bigger than normal. Your parents' living room is before your eyes, but you gaze out at it as if from the eyes of the very insects you had been trying to get rid of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, your memory returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad,\" you say, \"the can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it seems that the gas from it must have shrunk us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at him as a new level of understanding hits you. It's not that the whole house has gotten incredibly large--you and your father have both shrunk. Looking around, you see that you are at the stairs going to the next floor, where you and Dad both passed out earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Bronson?\" you ask. \"Is he OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen him yet. But, he must be around here too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the front door of the house opens.

She stops next to the stairs, only a short distance from you. Her feet, tan from her love of being barefoot outdoors, remain in her light brown sandals--a rare sight when she is home. You are stunned by the enormity of your own mom at your new size. You may not even be much bigger than one of her clear toenails. She towers over you so that you must strain your head back just to look up to her face. From your spot on the floor, you can see the entirety of her legs, fit from her evening walks, all the way up her sun dress. You quickly look away but notice your father doing exactly the same.

She stops at the door and puts a hand against the wall to balance herself as she takes off her sandals. With them in hand, she enters the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will we make her notice us?\" you ask Dad as you both continue your way through the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure yet. She won't stay in the bedroom long, though. She's just putting her shoes in the closet, and then she'll probably come back out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Dad predicted, a few seconds later, Mom leaves the bedroom. She passes by barefoot, completely unaware of her bug-sized family members on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should have plenty of time in the room to make a plan,\" Dad says. He then glances back, looking past you. \"I can't see Dani anymore, but Mittens doesn't seem to be coming yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you both reach the door to your parents' bedroom.

To make matters worse, Dad has followed your lead and dropped into the bag as well, though he has found his way to safety at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son?\" he asks, unable to see anything around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peel your face free and turn your head in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stuck,\" you say, \"to...something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not good,\" he answers. \"Hold on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe makes his way toward the source of your voice. A few seconds later you hear him again, now much closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound like you're still pretty high up. Can you see anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Well, I think I know where you are. There's something here. It's too heavy for me to move, though. You said you're stuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I can't move at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a tremble through the object you are stuck to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Dad says. \"I can't move this thing at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad doesn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute passes by silently, and then all of a sudden you are sent flying around inside of the bag--yet still stuck to the object. What seems to be an earthquake has all of the bag's contents being bounced back and forth. After a few violent seconds, everything suddenly stops, but then something entirely different--and unexpected--happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your sense of direction completely off kilter, you are looking straight forward through the open mouth of the bag, where the world has light, and far in the distance is your mom's face, looking down into her bag of make-up. Everything becomes dark again as she slides her hand into the bag, and you are startled when you find yourself suddenly jerked upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you leave the bag, you see your mom's gigantic fingers holding the object you remain stuck to. Then, as she turns it around, you find yourself staring directly at her pursed lips, which you are rapidly being moved toward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, you are pressed into Mom's upper lip and slid across the width of it before being dragged again along her lower lip. This time, however, you are pulled off in the smear of lipstick applied to her bottom lip. From your new spot, you are yet again unable to struggle free, having been mashed and stuck into the lipstick. Your mom touches up her lip in spots for a few seconds before suddenly pressing her lips together, squeezing you between them. This movement spreads you out and leaves you face-down, with your limbs stretched out, upon her bottom lip. Gazing into a mirror, she cannot discern you from a clump of lipstick, but she feels your presence and tries to squeeze you into a thin layer with her lips. At this point, just before she accidentally squashes you along her mouth, you are broken loose and tumble free from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall straight down, and as you tumble the world flashes around you in a whirl. You are in the air for only a second, however, before you land on top of something soft and yet firm. You bounce off of it and start to fall backwards, but when you land upon it again you reach out and manage to grab onto something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to come to your senses, you realize that you are still with your mom, and she is moving. Then, you see her collarbones and shoulders above and before you, and higher still her neck and her face. She seems to have no idea of your predicament, looking ahead of herself as she walks. You then look back to what you are holding onto and see that it is the collar of her sun dress, right at her breasts. You have no choice but to hold on tightly, because as you look down you can see your mom's legs and feet as she walks through the house, and it seems to be about a half-mile drop to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her miniature son clings to her chest, Mom leaves her bedroom and heads to the dining room. She stops near Dani and begins to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" you hear Dani say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Mom turns and walks to the base of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna!\" she calls. \"We're going to go out to eat now! Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Mom stands still waiting for an answer, and you quickly make the decision to pull yourself up while you can. You've slowly been losing your grip as you've been hanging, so you climb onto Mom's breast and then hurriedly slide yourself legs-first underneath her bra, leaving only your arms, shoulders, and head exposed. For the time being, you are not only safe (and comfortable), but you also have a view of the world as Mom goes about her business. You consider calling out to her for help but decide to wait until a calmer time. Your heart is still racing and you've been dangerously close to death for a minute now. Plus, you fear catching her in surprise and being killed by accident. Better to wait until she's alone and relaxed, you decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna finally answers as she leaves her room and heads downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you found the others?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" Mom tells her. \"We're going to go out to eat anyway, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they're still not back when we get home?\" Dani asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll worry about that later. Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unaware of what happened in your father's situation, you hope he is safe as you are carried away out of the house with your mom and sisters.</span></div></div>",

After all, you don't want to get caught by Mittens. As you push through the carpet, you wonder if that was Dad's idea, after all. Why would Mittens go in the closet? You two should be safe until you can get Mom's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...what if she didn't notice you two? Or something worse? What if she did notice you and Dad but mistook you for two of the bugs invading the house?

Then, he turns to you. \"I'm going to look around. Your mom will be back for her work shoes tomorrow. Stay here. I'll be back soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are confused, but you obey. You sit down against the wall and gaze up at your mom's shoe collection. After a minute or two, you realize you don't know which way your dad went. You can't see him anywhere, but you don't think much more about it until at least an hour passes and he still hasn't returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?\" you call out, standing up. You receive no answer. \"Are you still in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to worry. Nothing has happened in the past hour, but where could he be?

At the toe end of one of the sandals, you once again realize how much your size has changed. A simple pair of shoes lay before you, several times your size. You are only about as wide as the strap is thick. The sandals make your heart race, and you decide to climb onto one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you put your hand onto the flat insole where your mom's toes had only recently been, you find that her sandals are still warm from use. You pull yourself up onto the sandal and feel that they are still damp as well. In fact, her sandals have slight depressions from her feet, especially where her toes had pressed into the leather insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breath in the smell of the sandal and let yourself fall flat upon it. You lay your face into the damp leather and stretch your arms and legs. For a minute, you simply relax and absorb the experience, taking in the smell, the feeling, and the unique situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you roll onto your back and gaze up. You imagine your mom standing over you, still unaware of your problems. A mix of fear and excitement floods your mind as you envision her slender, tan foot being raised over you, covering you in its shadow. Then, Mom slips her foot into the sandal. First, she plants her toes behind you, over the heel portion of the shoe, as she enters the straps. Next, you find yourself being overtaken, and Mom unknowingly lays her toes over your tiny body. Damp and a little dirty from always walking around barefoot, her toes cover your body like warm pillows. Then, they push forward, and you are forced underneath the sole of her foot. It is incredibly warm and strangely comforting. You imagine the pressure is not overwhelming. Perhaps you can even stay here, remain her insole forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump, startled. Quickly standing up and brushing yourself off, you see your dad standing nearby, arms crossed and watching you with a face of confusion and bewilderment. You feel your face flush with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...fell--was taking a nap. Here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad does not answer, but he continues to look at you, as if searching your soul for the truth. You look away, unable to keep eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's definitely not the place to fall asleep, son,\" he finally says. \"Come on. I've found a place to hide for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow him, feeling ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes you to where Mom keeps her work shoes. You immediately recognize her favorite pair--all-white converse shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're still tired, now's the time to get some sleep,\" Dad says to you as he sits down and leans against one of the converse shoes. \"I'll sleep after you, and then I'll keep watch the rest of the night. We'll have to be quick in the morning. When she starts getting ready to leave for work, we'll have to be out in front of her shoes. From there, we'll just hope for the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, still trying to forget your embarrassment. Dad says nothing more, and eventually you feel tired as you relax in the darkness of the closet. The last thing you remember before falling asleep is the sight of your dad staring blankly across from you, concern in his face.</span></div></div>",

You had fallen asleep laying on your side on the insole of your mom's shoe, but you had tossed and turned all night, unable to stay asleep for long due to lack of blankets and sudden fearful thoughts of what could happen to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving nothing to do the day before but sit and talk with Dad, you two at least bonded as you waited for your mom to come. Neither of you knew what would happen, but you both remained optimistic. The unspoken rule was not to speak of Mom putting on the shoes you were both stuck in. But, you both knew it was a very real possibility. That, or being unable to get your mom's attention or get out of the shoe before you both died of starvation. There was no sense in discussing such morbid outcomes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear your mom groaning as she smacks the alarm clock. She is very comfortable in her soft bed, buried under layers of warm blankets. However, it is a work day, so she reluctantly slides her legs over the side of the bed and tucks her feet into her slippers. You can hear her yawn loudly, and then she leaves the bedroom and everything becomes quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad is awake now too, and he looks as tired as you felt. Underneath his eyes are bags, and wrinkles you had never noticed now line his face. He seems to have aged significantly just overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" he says to you, forcing a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the reality of the situation is still imprinted on your minds. You are both hungry, sleep-deprived, and trapped in a near-hopeless situation. All that either of you can do is wait patiently for the narrow window of opportunity for escape that would eventually come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance, the sound of the shower meets your ears. It is strangely soothing to hear the pattering of the water against the tub. To your tired body and mind, it mesmerizes you. You know it must be about four in the morning--the time your mom normally wakes up on work days--and imagining a hot shower is incredibly relaxing. You sit against the side of the shoe in a daze for the next twenty minutes until the shower comes to a stop. Then it becomes quiet again, with the only breaks in the silence coming from the sink faucet being turned on and off as Mom brushes her teeth and readies herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are Mom's work shoes, aren't they?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Dad doesn't answer. You believe they are; however, you also know she rotates shoes and has a few different pairs she likes to wear to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you hear the dresser drawers opening and realize your mom is back. She is getting dressed and probably applying make-up. The early morning slowly drags on, and soon you unknowingly drift to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, Dad is gently shaking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, it's about time to wake up now,\" he says to you. \"She should be here anytime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Mom is finishing up her morning routine. As she enters the closet, you can hear her feet pitter-pattering against the wooden floor. You begin to tremble with fear. Dad, with his wits better about him, starts crying out at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RENEE!! HONEY!! PLEASE HELP US!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his voice is drowned out by her own as she talks to Mittens, who finds Mom's socked feet absolutely fascinating and can not resist sniffing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it, Mittens,\" she gently tells the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she kneels down and reaches for a pair of her favorite work shoes. You and Dad both see her fingers enter the back of the shoe you two are in, and before either of you can cry for help again, she drags out the shoes she has chosen to wear to work and unknowingly topples you and Dad over inside of one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get up as fast as you can, in a full panic now, but you are almost instantly pushed back down to the ground as Mom puts her foot into the shoe. Her toes come down over the two of you and pin you and Dad between them and the insole. Then, she slides the rest of her foot into the shoe, and you are unknowingly dragged along in the groove beneath her toes to the end of the shoe. Dad, on the other hand, is not as lucky. He is pushed along underneath your mom's foot, but he is caught underneath the sole of her foot, and when she stands on her left foot while putting on her other shoe, most of her weight is put directly upon him. You have no way of knowing, but your dad is gently smashed to death underneath the sole of his wife's foot, instantly staining the bottom of her sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both shoes on and some strange, warm liquid oozing along the bottom of her left foot, Mom mutters. She feels some kind of pebble underneath her big toe, but it is not the first time one of those annoying spiders invading the house has taken up residence in her shoes. She looks at her alarm clock and decides there is not enough time to change out her socks and shoes, so she turns and leaves the closet, feeling what she believes is a spider becoming more and more squashed with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the pebble in her shoe, you have somehow managed to survive. Still caught in the grooves behind her toes, you have little to no weight being put upon you. Yet, your fear is at an all-time high. You are trapped inside of your mom's shoe, underneath of her foot, as she prepares to leave for a long 12-hour shift at the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are unable to do anything but struggle to survive every step and shift of Mom's foot as she leaves the house on her way to work.</span></div></div>",

Your mom is now sitting in her car, driving to work, completely unaware that a small pebble in her shoe is actually her oldest son. Despite having your nerves shot by the fear of death with every step Mom took on her way to her car, you are now in a ironically comfortable position. At the end of your mom's left leg, inside of her solid white converse shoes, trapped between the insole and her foot in no-show white socks, and caught in the small groove between her toes and sole, you are somehow not doing too badly. The warmth of her foot inside of the tight space of her shoe, as well as the softness of her cotton sock against your face, is far from the worst of places you could be. However, you are unable to move--not that you think you'd want to. The last thing on your mind is to try to get your mom's attention right now. If she felt something living moving inside of her shoe, she would almost certainly shoot first and ask questions never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try talking to Dad, unaware of his fate, and you of course receive no answer. You are worried about him. You can't think of a single reason why he would not be able to answer except...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you remember what he always told you. \"Focus on the task at hand; don't worry about anything outside of it's due time.\" You can only hope he is still alive. Soon enough, you'll be back to struggling for your own survival again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** ** *** ** ***</div><br>\r\nRenee parks her car in the hospital lot and turns off her car. Then, she opens the door and gets out. She frowns. There's that pesky pebble again, she thinks, feeling it pressing into her toes as it is squeezed between her foot and the insole of her shoe. Thankfully, the insides of her shoes are soft. It doesn't hurt as much as it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter working for about an hour, her frustration hits a peak. She takes a moment and sits down to take off her shoe. That damn pebble is starting to hurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

But, after standing up and starting to walk again, the pain suddenly vanishes. Something warm and wet oozes underneath of her big toe this time, but she almost instantly forgets about it. Even on her lunch break, the strange occurrences going on inside of her left shoe have been completely forgotten, so she doesn't yet find out what's going on. The hours pass, and eventually her shift ends. She heads home, collapses onto the couch after a long day, and calls for her husband. Strangely, he and the boys are still nowhere to be found. She sighs and turns on the TV, too exhausted at the moment to do anything but relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watches her favorite show, she uses her feet to slip out of her shoes, and she lets them tumble to the floor. Then, she stretches out her legs, squeezing her tired muscles, and rests her feet on the arm of the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the next commercial comes around, she brings her left foot into her lap and wraps her hands around it. Her socks are hot, sticky, stiff, and smelly from working on her feet all day. If her husband was back from wherever he had disappear to, she would've begged him sweetly for a foot massage. However, she had to settle for massaging her own feet, and she gently rubs her sole and toes, which were sore from having to walk on a pebble early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezes and caresses the spots that bothered her the most, massaging them for several minutes before remembering the strange, wet feelings from earlier. She then turns the bottom of her foot toward her and looks upon the underside of her sock. There were two small crimson stains--one on the sole of her foot and another under her big toe. There seemed to be small body parts as well, but they were far too mashed and crumpled to even begin to imagine what they once were. Her best guess was two unfortunate spiders decided her work shoes would be a good place to stay. They chose poorly, she thinks to herself. Serves them right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee then peels her sock off of her foot and tosses it to the floor. Her hot feet could now be aired out. Her other sock falls to the floor and then she lies back and props her feet back onto the other arm of the couch. She could smell her feet even from the other end of the couch. But, it only makes her proud. She put in a hard day of work, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind then returns to the spiders that met their end beneath her foot, having to suffer their deaths inside of her shoe over the course of her long, half-day shift. Maybe they were a couple. Or a father and son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, she thought, where could my own husband and sons be?</span></div></div>",

For now, it's more important to get somewhere safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you and Dad several minutes to maneuver through the carpet in the hallway to Dani's bedroom. The door is open and you both enter, panting from the exertion. Not surprisingly, you discover the bedroom a mess. Dani has left clothes--both clean and worn--strewn all over the floor, as well as various shoes, socks, underwear, DVD cases, homework assignments, and generally everything else Dani has brought to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Dad pass by two enormous socks Dani had once slipped off her feet upon entering her room, only to leave them semi-balled up on the floor near the door. Much like the rest of her clothing choices, these socks are very colorful, albeit mismatched. One sock is black with green designs and the other is white with multicolored stripes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby is the desk your parents got Dani for her birthday a few years back. Her laptop is on top of it, as well as books and more papers--with no sense of organization. Across the plain of carpet covered in clothes is Dani's bed, unmade and with the blankets almost thrown off of it. Her closet door is open beyond the bed, and you can see what is likely her hamper, hidden under a mountain of dirty clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will we ever get her attention in here?\" you ask. Glancing at your dad, you see him frown and sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, your stomach rumbles, and you notice you've picked up the smell of nachos nearby. Looking around, you find the source: a paper plate of half-eaten corn chips, salsa, and cheese. It was likely remnants from the night before, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope we don't have to resort to eating from that,\" Dad says observantly. \"But, on the other hand, that may be our only chance at food for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we never went out to eat like we were going to,\" you add, remembering your lack of a meal today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Dad says, inhaling deeply. \"What to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** ** *** ** ***</div><br>\r\nDani sits at the table with Mittens in her arms, lightly petting the purring cat.

She then opens the door to let Aliyah and one other friend of Dani's into the house. \"Dani, your friends are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Dani says to them as she stands up from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls break into unorganized chatter and make their way to Dani's room.

Her friends, Aliyah and Andrea, try to find somewhere to sit in the room. Andrea turns the desk chair around and sits on it, and Aliyah kicks some clothes away to make an empty space on the floor to sit. She sits down with her back against the wall and stretches out her legs, extending them towards you and Dad.

She then outstretches the leg and does the same with her other leg. A few seconds later, her shoes have been placed beside her and she is relaxing with her legs stretched towards you two. Aliyah wears black no-show socks with red writing under her toes (presumably the brand name, but they've been worn enough to make the letters indiscernible). You and Dad gaze up at the soles of her socked feet, which fit tightly. You can see the outline of her toes in the socks, what seems about two stories above you. Her feet are also close enough to you that you can smell them. Warmth radiates from them, having walked several blocks to reach your house. Aliyah's feet have a mild scent like honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can get her attention,\" Dad replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should we do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of a few ways,\" he says. \"I'm just worried about her reacting in a way that gets us killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Aliyah, who is laughing as she talks with Dani and Andrea.

He is visibly dazed, and his head spins as he lays on his hands and knees at Dani's feet. Aliyah looks at him, unable to hold back a grin, and says, \"Surely Daddy wouldn't refuse his daughter a massage, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliyah turns her attention back to you, and you are startled when you both meet eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you,\" she says, \"where were we? Oh, right. I could barely feel your hands through my socks, so...enough with these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slips her socks off her feet and then pushes one of them upon you, smothering you with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't smell bad, do they?\" She giggles as you tumble backwards and continue to get rubbed with Aliyah's sock. It smells more strongly of her honey-scented feet. After she finishes torturing you, she tosses her socks aside. \"OK, enough of that. I want you to massage my toes, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly stand up, only to find Aliyah sliding her feet mere inches from you. She turns her feet onto their sides and extends her toes so that you can reach them. However, even this isn't enough. She picks you up, this time around your chest, and drops you onto the sole of her foot. Then, she points to her toes and speaks to you in a low, soothing murmur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rub them hard,\" she orders you. \"It's hard for me to feel you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climb down onto her toes and start to rub them as hard as you can, Aliyah looks over at Dani and her dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He still isn't doing anything?\" Aliyah says, a hint of irritation in her voice. \"Andrea, can you grab Dani's lotion? <i>Please?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Aliyah has the lotion, she takes a few squirts into her hands and reaches forward to pick up Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come closer,\" Aliyah says to Dani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Aliyah takes Dani's foot into her hands, still holding Dad and loads of lotion, and she massages your sister's foot, carefully but rather firmly pressing your dad into the sole of Dani's foot. You continue to massage Aliyah's foot, feeling sorry for your dad but not wanting to suffer the same fate. It was his slightly his fault, after all, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aliyah is massaging Dani's feet, she moves you to her other foot. Several minutes pass by before Aliyah finishes, and when she lets go of Dani's feet, you can see that Dad has become stuck to her sole. You can't tell if he is still conscious or even alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was really nice,\" Dani admits, looking at her feet. She then removes her dad from them and holds him in her hands. She examines him with worry in her face. \"Is he OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just passed out,\" Aliyah says. \"Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still trying to please Aliyah when you are suddenly grabbed and moved through the air towards Dani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Aliyah says to Dani, \"will you do me? Your brother isn't very good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are dropped to the floor, and you look back to your sister in fear. You had tried your best! Was she really going to do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDani looked down at you, and then she answered, \"_____.\"</span></div></div>",

You wonder how long it will take before they became tired of using you and your dad. Or, is this just the start of all that was to come?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea's feet have a strong, sweaty smell. You try to grin and bear the smell, though, because she seems so excited to have you massage her feet. Her socks are soft and thick, and you can't seem to do much for her. She is too shy to do anything, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so nice to do this,\" she says to you. \"You're so little...and cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face flushes red as she says this, and she looks away from you quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to rub Andrea's feet as well as you can. Eventually you walk to the other foot, and it's at this point that she finally speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm going to take off my socks, OK?\" she says, pulling her feet into her lap. Her socks then come off, and she extends her bare feet back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resume massaging again, but after only a second Andrea pulls her foot back and giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, that's so ticklish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot returns to you, so you decide to keep going. You can tell she's trying her best not to burst out laughing, however. She lasts for only a few more seconds before she tucks her legs in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do it!\" she exclaims. \"It's way too ticklish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls laugh along with Andrea, and you look up to see her leaning in close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" she begins, blushing again, \"can I...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't finish her sentence. Instead, she brings her hands around you, scooping you gently into them, and she raises you to her face. You then see her puckered pink lips closing in on you, and you are suddenly pressed between Andrea's lips and soft hands. Her upper lip envelops your face, and her lower lip presses onto your groin, and her warm breath flows over you like a heat wave. The kiss lasts only a brief second, but you find your pants getting tight, and you try your best to hide it as well as look nonchalant as the giant blushing teen continues to hold you in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my--!\" she says, noticing the bulge in your pants. Your face and hers both turn bright red in embarrassment. \"Did I--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues to stare at you in shock, but then her expression slowly changes to what seems to be joy. You don't understand what she is thinking, but all of a sudden things change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to use the restroom,\" Andrea says suddenly, standing up quickly, still holding onto you. \"Be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying anything more to her friends or letting them know that she still has you, Andrea walks out of the room and goes to the restroom. Once inside, she locks the door and places you on the kitchen counter. She then puts the toilet lid down and sits upon it. You look up at her and see that she is smiling and full of a strange happiness, as if she had just accomplished a lifelong goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I don't know if you know this,\" she says clumsily, \"but I think you're really hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confusion builds when she suddenly reaches forward and grabs you around the waist. She carefully tries to unzip your pants, to your surprise, but when she is unable to manage the zipper or button, she gently pulls them down, nearly ripping off your still-erect dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you doing?\" you ask, but she doesn't answer. Instead, she pulls at your boxers until they tear, and then pulls off your shirt. Now almost completely naked, her warm fingers wrap around your body and you look up into her eyes as she intently examines you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never actually done anything like this,\" she says. Then, without explaining, she brings you back up to her face and places your penis between her giant lips. She starts by gently pursing and puckering her lips around it as she moves you back and forth, struggling to figure out how to get you off at your size. After a few seconds, she gently sucks on your dick and you feel as if she's either going to suck it right off or pull your entire body into her mouth. You notice that she has placed her other hand down into her own pants, and she is pleasuring herself as she works on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute in, she licks your dick with the tip of her tongue, but then she proceeds to lick you like a lollipop, drenching your naked body in her saliva from your legs up to your face. You feel incredibly turned on and forget how wrong it all seems. Then, she returns to sucking and stroking your dick with her lips, and you begin to climax. You start to fear cumming into her mouth, but she continues without noticing that you are close to orgasm. You are completely unable to hold back as she sucks on you, and you explode into her lips. When she feels you cum, she stops suddenly and licks the cum from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh deeply, relieved and feeling absolutely incredible. You can't tell if you're more covered in Andrea's saliva or your own sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze up into her eyes, which are no longer full of nervousness as they usually are around you. She stares at you sexily and smiles happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you...do you mind if I...use you?\"</span></div></div>",

After glancing at Dani's bare feet, she continues, \"Mine aren't either. I'm sure these two won't mind doing our toes, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize what she means as she opens the bag.

Aliyah takes you in one hand and Dad in the other, holding you both between her index finger and thumb. You both struggle against her grip, wondering what she's going to do to you--and if Dani will stop her. Aliyah bends her legs and plants both of her feet on the ground, then you feel yourself being moved downward. She puts you between the big and second toe of her right foot. They are both very soft and smooth, despite the pressure of being stuck between them that keeps you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to take my time doing my toes today,\" Aliyah says calmly. \"Maybe I'll even do some designs. Just remember...you two <i>chose</i> this~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places cotton balls between her remaining toes, and you see that Dad has been similarly placed between Aliyah's big and second toe of the other foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're so <i>small,</i>\" Andrea notes with a giggle. \"Are they even separating your toes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barely,\" Aliyah replies as she opens a container of nail polish. For the next few minutes, you can do nothing but remain held in mid-air between Aliyah's toes as she carefully paints her nails. Once she has finished her right foot, she gently blows on the polish, including you. Then, she leaves you in your place as she goes to work on her other foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls have gotten more comfortable and relaxed now, and they continue to talk about other things while Aliyah does her nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it almost my turn?\" Andrea eventually asks when Aliyah is finishing the second layer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Aliyah responds. \"This is fun, though. I kinda want to do another design.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend almost half an hour simply being held between Aliyah's toes before she finishes her nails. Then, she plucks you from her toes, grabbing you by the face, and lays you near Andrea's feet. Your dad soon joins you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you hear Aliyah saying behind you, \"do you two want to help this time, or would you rather get squeezed between Andrea's toes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your spirit broken, you look to your dad for guidance.

Even as junior high school teenagers, they seem as if gigantic skyscrapers of girls to you and Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your room's a mess!\" Aliyah exclaims. You know that Aliyah is Dani's best friend, and that they have known each other for years. An athletic sports lover, Aliyah is a light-skinned African American girl with long, wavy brown hair. She is very popular at school due to her attractiveness, talent in sports, and social-loving personality. However, she and Dani are known to fight a lot because of how close they are and Aliyah's propensity to be vain and stuck-up at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls step into the room, trying to avoid the dirty clothes and homework assignments. Aliyah stops near the plate you and Dad have climbed onto and are eating from. She has on an unzipped burgundy hoody, denim capris, and white canvas shoes with a single red stripe encompassing the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" you and Dad hear her say from high above, \"you even have leftovers on the floor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliyah gently taps the plate with her foot, but the force is enough topple you and Dad over. You land face-first into a pool of cold, sticky salsa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dare you to eat some,\" Aliyah says in a mischievous voice to the other girl, whose name is Andrea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew! No way!\" Andrea answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wipe salsa from your face, you see Andrea standing nearby. She is Caucasian and has long, flowing hair like Aliyah, only blonde instead. Her eyes are a lighter brown than Aliyah's, with a cute face. Though the Andrea you know has a dorky personality, you know that one day she will be a beauty. Unlike Aliyah and Dani, though, she is normally shy around those she doesn't know--especially boys. Your interactions with her in the past have you aware that she has a big crush on you, as she blushes and becomes flustered around you, hardly saying anything from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're selling Girl Scout cookies today for my little sister,\" Aliyah says to Dani. \"Want to come along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cookies? What kinds?\" Dani asks excitedly as she flops onto her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Aliyah answers, placing a plastic bag full of boxes of cookies on the ground and taking out a few of the boxes. \"Look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should try these,\" Andrea tells Dani, holding out a cookie from a box she had opened and been eating out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliyah swipes the cookie from Andrea's fingers and puts it in her mouth. You can hear the sound of it being chomped and crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No cookies for you!\" Aliyah says, still chewing the cookie. She pulls a chip, crusty with dried cheese and salsa, from the plate and tosses it at Andrea. The plate is shaken again when she does this, tossing you over and against a chip. She then adds, \"Only nachos for you! You're eating our merchandise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Andrea says, quickly stuffing another cookie into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls talk, you stand back up and look around for your dad. He is nearby but remains down where he first tumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad? Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stuck,\" he says, his voice somewhat muffled as he lays in a glob of nacho cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly go to him and try to tug him out, but the cheese is more solid than liquid after having sat out for hours, and Dad seems to have sunk into the goop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't good,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Dani calls for Mom, who appears in the doorway a few seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, can I go with my friends to sell cookies?\" Dani asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom is standing in the doorway with wide eyes and a blank expression. She lets her jaw drop in mock horror as she looks over the messy bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did your room get <i>so</i> dirty?\" she asks. \"Don't you know clothes go on hangers? In the closet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll clean it later. Promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Mom tells her. \"Before you can leave, this room needs to be cleaned up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffs a particularly rancid smell and waves her hand in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Dani,</i> are those nachos? <i>This</i> is why I don't let you have food in your room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the plate of nachos, you have still had no success in rescuing your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do, Dad? I can hear them talking about the plate. We have to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save yourself, son,\" he answers. \"I don't think I can get free. The more I struggle...the more I sink in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Aliyah's thumb comes flying in beside you. Her clear fingernail alone is as big as you, and you lose sight of Dad as her thumb covers him, accidentally landing in the sticky nacho cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad!\" you cry out, but you feel the plate being lifted, and the sudden shift causes you to loose your footing again. You fall off the side of the plate and drop a good distance down to the carpet below. Your landing is soft, but it knocks the wind out of you. When you open your eyes, you see Aliyah walking away, out of the room, with the plate of nachos in hand.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, your own situation is problematic as well, and your attention soon shifts to your own matter at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've fallen into Aliyah's plastic bag of Girl Scout cookies. Running around, you quickly discover that you are unable to get out. The bag, full of boxes, is stretched too much to allow you to push it down. Looking up, you see Dani pass by, but you can't see much else except for the ceiling miles above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I don't get out of here, these boxes will crush me when they leave,\" you think as you continue to look around, assessing your options. \"What would Dad do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls quickly clean the room, piling all of the clothes into the closet and putting everything else where it belongs. After a few minutes of work from the three girls, they have the room looking much better than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" Aliyah says. \"Think it's good enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mom?\" Dani calls down the hall from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to panic. You know if you don't get out soon, a simple shift of the huge boxes of cookies when the girls walk around with them will kill you. You notice that the opening on one of the boxes is loose, but you fear hiding inside the boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your hand is quickly forced when Dani gets permission to leave. You hurry and enter the box of cookies just as Aliyah picks up the bag.</span></div></div>",

He is completely unable to move, and he knows his chance of survival is very low now. His mind shifts momentarily to his son, whom he hopes is safe. Something seemed to have happened to him, as his voice disappeared suddenly when the plate was lifted. But, at the moment, Calvin can only worry about himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Calvin feels a strange sensation, as if thousands of pounds of weight surrounding him were suddenly thrown off. In fact, the plate of nachos had been tossed in the trash by Aliyah, who still had nacho cheese--and her friend's shrunken father--smothered across her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Andrea, who was nearby also tossing away trash from Dani's room, and she playfully put her hand up close to Andrea's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross--No!\" Andrea exclaims, reacting by turning away from Aliyah's cheese-covered thumb and putting her arms in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliyah then teases Andrea by opening her mouth wide, sticking out her tongue, and wiping the cheese from her thumb onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah~,\" she says to Andrea, who looks back with surprise in her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's <i>so</i> gross!\" Andrea says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliyah, with her mouth still open and tongue dangling, smiles and then closes her mouth. She sticks her thumb in her mouth and licks off the last residue of cheese from it, and then she smirks to Andrea as she works on the cheese in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you don't want any?\" Aliyah asks, with both her eyes and lips smiling broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea walks away, grossed out, and Aliyah swallows, unaware that she has accidentally eaten her friend's dad. For his part, Calvin could do nothing but listen as he remained stuck in the cheese. Eaten alive, he remained conscious as he was carried down the girl's throat, bundled in cheese and her saliva, until he was dropped into her stomach a few seconds later. Once there, he found himself unable to breath. He was tossed around inside of Aliyah's stomach as she moved around, bending over to pick up things in Dani's room and skipping around happily. His last thoughts were of his oldest son, as well as his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Aliyah's slender body, her stomach murmured as Calvin was digested, ending his life as simple sustenance for the teen girl.</span></div></div>",

The carpet covering each step makes for fairly easy climbing, but at your new size the ascent is tedious with the incredible distance you must cross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few minutes in, you hear your mom nearby, standing at the bottom of the stairway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna!\" she calls. \"Come get your shoes, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, Dad looks down at you. You two are both in the middle of climbing one of the many steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're safest staying where we are,\" he says. \"We're away from the center of the stairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp and look up as you hear Jenna leaving her room and coming down the stairs. She flashes by overhead, her bare feet coming nowhere near you or Dad. You both wait until she returns a few seconds later. Once again, she walks up the stairs without harming you. However, something strange happens next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the--?\" you hear Jenna say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill climbing the step, you cannot see your sister. However, having just climbed onto the top of the step, Dad is just able to see his oldest daughter bending down and picking something very small off of the floor at the top of the stairway. He only glimpses it, but he notices two very tiny legs kicking from the thing Jenna has in her fingers. Without saying another word, Jenna returns to her room, taking the mysterious thing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" you ask as you pull yourself up beside your dad, who is still staring up at where Jenna stood, lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...that Jenna found Bronson,\" he says slowly. \"But, she didn't say anything. Just took him to her room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder about Jenna's intentions, unable to explain what took place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should hurry upstairs,\" Dad finally says, regaining his composure. \"There's nothing we can do from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, you two do not even begin to climb the next step before Jenna re-emerges from her room and starts to scan the floor. After a few seconds, she walks down the stairs, inspecting them as she carefully goes down. When she reaches you two, you and Dad stick out against the white carpet. You both look up, startled as Jenna's bare feet come down near you. A small, sly smile curves on one side of her lips and she bends down, reaching for you and Dad. Both of you are engulfed within her hand and wrapped within her fingers. Without any explanation, Jenna takes you and Dad back to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you are released from your sister's warm, slightly sweaty hand, you fall onto her bed from a short height. You and Dad land next to Bronson, who is both surprised to see you two and afraid of what Jenna is planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna, take us to your mother right away,\" Dad says right away, his voice wavering between demanding his giant daughter and walking on eggshells with his tone so as not to upset her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Jenna replies, with a cool nonchalance you never expected from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Jenna?\" you ask, beginning to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have to answer to you,\" she replies matter-of-factly. She then yawns and sits down on the bed, crossing her legs and leaning over the three of you. You notice that she is trying to appear calm and in control, but you can see the excitement in her eyes. Your own heart pounds in your chest as you find yourself unable to guess what the intends to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting comfortable on her bed, she ignores you and the others and pulls her cell-phone from her pocket. She says nothing and starts texting. Her phone alone is many times bigger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look at your dad and brother. Bronson appears to be unharmed, but his usual disinterested demeanor has been overtaken by his fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought maybe this only happened to me,\" Bronson says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're glad to see you safe,\" Dad tells him, turning away from his frustrating daughter for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Bronson asks, habitually flipping his hair out of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We think it was the bug bomb,\" Dad answers. \"We're not sure if it can be reversed yet, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" Jenna murmurs, \"that's good to know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you planning to do?\" Dad asks her, facing back to her and making his tone harsher. \"Why aren't you helping us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the only one who knows what's happened to you,\" Jenna says without looking away from her phone. \"I can do whatever I want with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Dad asks, stunned. \"Listen, if you don't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna pushes him down and covers him with her fingertip. He pounds on her gigantic finger with his tiny arms, to no avail, and shouts in a muffled voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hurt Dad!\" you say, running to his defense--only to stop short when you realize you can do nothing against Jenna's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I want to hurt you guys?\" she asks, finally looking away from her phone. You look back up at her--the sister who seems distant with her own family, much like Bronson. It seems so strange to see your younger sister from your new perspective. It feels even stranger to be treated like toys by her in the present circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dad stops his useless struggle, Jenna takes her finger off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friends are <i>so</i> excited to see you guys,\" she says. Then, she looks at you and adds, \"Especially <i>you</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. Jenna returns her attention to her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've decided to have a sleepover at Alicia's house, and you three are coming with me. Should be <i>lots</i> of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Dad, and Bronson all look at each other. Being shrunk and in the care of a bunch of teenage girls...the future isn't looking too bright.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun is setting behind the trees of the neighborhood when Jenna presses the doorbell of Alicia's house. She stands back and places a hand over the pocket of her purse in which she has the shrunken guys of her family. The door soon gives way and Alicia greets your sister. Her voice reminds you of the infatuation you have had with her ever since Bronson dated her sister. She is too young for you to seriously consider, but she is certainly cute and flirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you can see nothing at the moment, you do hear your sister complimenting Alicia on her hair. The seventeen year-old constantly changes up her appearance, and today her hair is a contrasting mix of light blonde, pale pink, and subtle crimson, creating a sort of strawberry blonde look that falls in smooth waves to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Alicia says quietly when their initial excited conversation slows down, \"did you bring them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Jenna answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a pause, in which you imagine that a smile or hint of inner anticipation has come upon Alicia's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all in the basement,\" Alicia says, and Jenna begins walking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Bronson, and Dad bounce around at your sister's hip as she follows Alicia downstairs. Soon you can hear Camila's voice from a nearby room, and Bronson gulps. He has not seen or talked with her since their breakup four months ago. After dating on and off for the past couple years, Bronson stopped responding to Camila's calls and messages when he began remaining at home more often, and their relationship ended without much finality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like her sister, Camila frequently overhauls her appearance. As Jenna and Alicia enter the room the two sisters share in the basement, your sister comments on Camila's new look as well. At fifteen, she adheres more to the 'scene' way of life than her sister, having heavy eye makeup, voluminous hair, stylish and colorful clothes, and 'shark bite' lip rings. Embarrassed by the sudden compliment from your sister, Camila smiles, glances down, and pushes her hair behind her ear, revealing hoop earrings under her straight, black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She actually hasn't changed it up for a few months now,\" Alicia says of her sister's embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Jenna says. She seems to be pondering something when she suddenly notices the other girl in the room, seated on the other side of the bed with Camila. \"Oh, Rachael! I didn't see you there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her name, you remember the girl named Rachael. You have not seen much of her, and you know even less of this girl who is as pretty as she is quiet. You seem to recall her having high cheekbones but soft features, with fair skin upon which her pale pink lips seem to pop out, and crimson hair with green eyes that seem to sparkle when she looks at you, captivating and trapping most boys that make contact with them. But despite her compelling attractiveness, Rachael does not speak much. You do not know whether it is because she is shy or instead reserved. When she does talk, though, she can be deceptively sharp in her words. Her innocent demeanor belies the way that she speaks her mind when willing to, holding nothing back in her opinions. In a word, Rachael is 'mysterious' to you. Even now, she remains quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom outside of the purse, the room falls silent. The volume on the nearby TV drifts down to zero, and the bedroom door is closed. All that you can hear is the air conditioning flowing inside of the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all excited to see this,\" Alicia says as Jenna slips her purse off her shoulder and drops it to the floor. The girls sit on the floor around the purse, and Jenna kneels next to it before unzipping the pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight suddenly strikes your eyes, but Jenna's fingers blot it back out as they come upon you and the others. Her thumb shoves you against her fingers, and you feel yourself being taken upward. Then, your sister drops you, Bronson, and Dad onto the carpeted floor. You see two knees before your eyes--a girl seated on her legs. Looking up, you meet eyes with Rachael. Her beautiful green eyes open wider upon seeing you. You can almost feel her excitement, and you realize your own heart is racing. Looking around, you find that you and your shrunken family are surrounded by the gigantic teen girls. Your sister has a proud expression on her smiling face as she watches her friends' reactions. Alicia and Rachael cannot help but stare at the three of you, and their stunned expressions make them appear as if they've just opened early Christmas presents. You also notice that Camila has not taken her eyes off of Bronson, and she looks less happy than the others. He, on the other hand, stares straight at the floor like a prisoner who has lost all hope, and Dad looks everywhere except at the girls, seemingly already contemplating how to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it,\" Alicia says, stroking her cheek. As if barely able to contain her excitement, she suddenly shifts around and sits cross-legged. One of her feet, in purple socks, bounces rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all ours to have fun with,\" Jenna says, taking one of your legs between her fingers and dangling you upside-down high above the floor. \"What should we do with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got all we need for a night of fun here,\" Alicia says with a laugh. \"Snacks, drinks, TV, movies, games...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder who can stay up the latest?\" Rachael says, her lips breaking into a slow smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be a long night for them,\" Camila adds, and Bronson shudders under the weight of her ongoing stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna giggles and puts you back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea,\" she begins.</span></div></div>",

You accept your fate and close your eyes as the fifteen year-old's small, cushiony hand approaches, fingers spread wide and palm stretched. Her fingers fold over you and press you face-first into the center of her warm and soft hand. She raises you up and then flips over her hand. When she extends her fingers, she inspects you as you sit in her open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to win,\" she says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she suddenly brings you up to her face and presses her puckered lips upon your groin.

She has her head in her hands and watches, but her blank expression does not betray what she might be thinking of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Rachael answers. \"Ready? Set. Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that instant, the action begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamila pulls off each of your shoes, tossing them carelessly to the floor where they become likely forever lost in the carpet. Then, she tugs at the ends of your jeans, and your dick--still hard from her kiss--is tugged down by the waistband. You cry out in pain, but Camila continues to pull anyway. She accidentally tears one leg off of your pants, and then she rips off the rest of your pants like a band-aid, causing you to groan again. Her finger then moves to your waist, and she tears off your boxes with the tip of her fingernail. With you now exposed, she raises you back up to her face, and you watch as Camila slips her lips around your stiff, upright dick. At that moment, the tip of her warm, wet tongue slides down upon your dick, and you tense up in pleasure. She licks at your dick and then begins to suck at you, and you are barely able to control yourself. You reach out and try to grab at the palm of her hand, but then she takes things a step forward and raises you into their air, holding you only by the suction on your dick. As the rest of your body bends down, you feel an incredible rush of pleasure. It lasts only a second before she lets you fall back into the soft palm of her hand. Then, you see her place her mouth near your feet, and her tongue emerges. She licks all the way up your legs, pressing her tongue and mouth against your groin, and then continues licking you all the way up to and onto your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow slathered with her saliva, you open your eyes to see her other hand approaching, and she takes your miniscule penis between her fingertips. She tries to stroke you, but her technique of moving her fingertips up and down does not do much. Noticing this, she tries to rub at your dick with the tip of her thumb as she holds it in place against her index finger. You start to feel very aroused, and Camila gradually learns which places cause you to scrunch up in pleasure the most. Soon, she is rubbing against the veins in your penis that get you off the most, and your find yourself bending and kicking your legs, feeling incredibly turned on. Yet, she can't seem to finish you off, and her increasing haste worsens her technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamila glances around and notices that the other girls have not gotten their guys to come yet. She then looks back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will get you to come?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay in the center of her soft hand, panting and sweated, you gaze up at this teenage girl. You're close, you think, but the combination is difficult to reach with our size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, rather than saying what flashes into your mind, you blurt you, \"Let me rub up against your foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a confused expression come over Camila's face, but it disappears quickly with her desire to win the game. Her fingers come over you and hold you in place as she moves you swiftly to her feet. Then, she overturns her hand and drops you upon the sole of her socked foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis will work, you think as you hug the side of her foot. You plant your face into the soft, white, thin cotton of her sock and start to hump her soft sole. The realization comes to your mind that you will have a lot of explaining to do, but in the moment you decide to continue anyway. Having already been aroused to a high you have rarely before felt, you come within seconds, squirting all over Camila's sock. You collapse against her foot and lay down, fully relaxed. Beneath you, your penis throbs between your hips and Camila's foot. Unfortunately, the immense satisfaction you feel at this instant is immediately robbed as Camila jumps up and, in the process, throws you from her soft foot. You fall into the carpet at her feet and stare up at the teenage goddess as she celebrates winning the game. Nearby, the other two stop jerking their person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got his cum all over your foot,\" Alicia laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won; who cares!\" Camila responds, tugging off her soiled sock and tossing it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe he got off to your foot,\" Rachael says, turning her eyes upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attention of the other girls comes to you now as well, and you realize that the time for explaining has come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your brother has a foot fetish,\" Rachael tells Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill lying on the bed, Jenna also gazes down at you, and as you look up at her, you can see her legs kicking back and forth over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you liked feet?\" your sister asks. \"Are you turned on by mine, too, you sicko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face flushes with embarrassment, despite your efforts to hide it. It's true that you have at times secretly stared at your little sister's feet, especially when she is relaxing in her white, no-show socks after a long day at school or when she has freshly-painted nails. For as long as you can remember, Jenna has had cute toes and smooth, slender feet. How would things change now that she knows your secret?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He probably dreams at night of massaging your feet,\" Alicia laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or sucking your toes,\" Rachael snorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Camila decides to start teasing you. She inches her toes toward you and then places them upon your stomach. You find yourself face-to-face with her middle toe, and the next second she slides the warm sole of her bare foot upon your body. She gently presses you into the carpet beneath her foot and then moves her big toe onto your face, trying to get your mouth open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on!\" she says. \"Lick it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head away, and she gently squeezes your head into the bottom of her big toe. Then, she takes her foot off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We <i>so</i> can't let him live this down!\" Rachael laughs. \"We should do something terrible to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Alicia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should make him lick your toes, Jenna,\" Camila suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or spend the night in your sock!\" Rachael says, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your <i>fantasy,</i> brother?\" Jenna asks you mockingly.</span></div></div>",

The other girls look at her, excited. \"We'll watch a movie, and they will feed us while we sit back and relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds awesome,\" Alicia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls go on talking, and you look at your brother and dad. Bronson seems to have become very depressed and continues to stare at the ground. Dad, on the other hand, notices you looking his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" you ask quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep thinking of a way out. I'll let you know if I think of anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying that trying to get away on our own is better than being with Jenna?\" you ask. Dad says nothing. It feels strange, you think. You've been discovered by your sister, but you may be better off trying to get away from her and making your way through an unknown house at the size of an insect. You begin to feel as glum as your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't lose hope,\" Dad says to you and Bronson. \"Be patient; our opportunity will come. If we just give up now, we won't live to see another day. Let's do as they say, and soon things will get better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the girls have chosen a movie to watch and have poured a small bowl of trail mix upon a paper towel on a nearby bed. Jenna scoops you and the others up and puts you beside the trail mix, and you see that the girls have gathered blankets and pillows upon the floor in front of the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the plan,\" Jenna tells you three, as if you were no longer her family. \"We're going to lay down here and watch a movie, and you three need to give us our snacks. We'll open our mouths when we're ready, and one of you needs to be giving us something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you better be quick,\" Rachael says, raising her head beside the bed to look at you three. \"<i>Or else.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you guys aren't doing a good job, you'll be in big trouble,\" Jenna says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might even feed you all to the dog,\" Camila adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Jenna says, slamming her hand on the bed and toppling all three of you, as well as bouncing around the trail mix, \"show some hustle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna's face disappears from view as she lies down beside her friends. You look to Dad, who has already picked up an M&amp;M--which is just as big as he is--and is grimly carrying it across the bed. You and Bronson follow suit, fearing upsetting the girls. You pick up a piece of popcorn, which is surprisingly light but makes your hands buttery. Bronson walks with you, a raisin in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the edge of the bed, you and the others approach carefully. Bronson nearly slips upon the slope of the bed, and Dad drops his M&amp;M in a hurry to try and save your brother. Luckily, Bronson does not fall off, but the M&amp;M rolls off of the bed and hits Jenna's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Try</i> to get it in our <i>mouths,</i>\" she says, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you see Rachael's open mouth, awaiting your piece of popcorn. Her eyes flicker toward you and you gulp uneasily as you both make eye contact. A misstep, you think, and you could find yourself falling down into that mouth. Rachael returns her attention to the movie across the room, and you toss the popcorn down to her. You watch as it falls into her open mouth, tumbling against her tongue. She closes her mouth before it hits her uvula, and she barely chews it before she sends it to her stomach. Her mouth reopens, and there is no sign that it ever existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come I'm not getting anything?\" Camila asks. \"My mouth is open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Jenna says. \"There's only three of you, and you need to keep all four of us happy, so you'd better hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want Bronson to feed me,\" Camila adds. \"An M&amp;M, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the others hurry back to the trail mix. The pace back to the bedside quickens, but you three remain cautious at the slope at the edge. Dad successfully feeds Alicia a cereal piece, and Bronson tosses Camila her M&amp;M. You drain a raisin into Jenna's mouth, which she takes one bite into and quickly spits out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ew!</i>\" she exclaims in disgust. She sits up and turns to you three. Her attention turns immediately upon you when she discovers who threw her the raisin. \"Don't give me <i>raisins!</i> I <i>hate</i> raisins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you mutter, quickly hurrying back to the snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna lies back down, and another cycle of feeding the girls continues.

Her mouth moves smoothly up and down, her lips pursed, as she quietly chews the candy. Then, when she swallows, you can see the movement of the candy through her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to work,\" Alicia says in a demanding tone, looking up at you, \"or <i>you'll</i> be one of the snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly realize you have been staring at her and you quickly return to action, feeling your face redden with embarrassment. Sure, she was cute--very pretty, even--but you knew you had far better things to think about. She might truly be serious, as well. How horrible to be eaten alive like that M&amp;M! Even by her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou avoid the raisins completely, no longer trusting them to any of the girls. Dad races past you, the picture of diligence, and Bronson is focusing solely on Camila now, leaving you and Dad to feed the other three. You notice that sweat is rolling down Dad's face and realize that he's been quietly trying to make up for your mindlessness. You pick up a peanut and run back to the edge of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the three girls you and Dad must attend to becoming impatient, you both try to alternate who you throw snacks to, hoping to keep them all calm. Having just fed Alicia, and with Dad now finishing giving Rachael her newest snack, you head towards your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gradually approach the edge of the bed, ever careful not to slip and join the snack. Below you can see your sister's face, framed by her straight dark hair. She looks deceptively innocent and peaceful with her clear complexion, pouty lips, and relaxed face, but her mouth is open as she waits for food to fall into it, and despite her cutely asymmetrical white teeth and soft pink tongue, this is the first time you've ever feared death at her hands--or rather, her mouth. It seems as if the mix of naive, angsty teen girls and the sudden availability of miniature, helpless males has created this strange scenario in which you truly believe any of these pretty girls could easily and carelessly take your life. You gulp, feeling very anxious, and toss the peanut down to your sister, fearing her wrath in the event that she also hates peanuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, your aim is off, and you nearly jump down to correct its trajectory, becoming even more fearful. It hits your sister in the cheek again, and the flicker of her eyes back to you causes you to jump, startled. She stares intensely at you and sits up, turning to face you directly. Dad appears at your side in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are causing a lot of trouble,\" Jenna says to you, her gigantic face before you like the face of God. \"Are you <i>trying</i> to mess our night up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't mean to,\" you say, feeling pathetic with your head down, unable to even hold eye contact with your younger sister. Dad stands beside you, saying nothing for the time being and carefully monitoring the situation. Jenna continues to stare you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if not believing the sincerity of your response, Jenna raises her arm and reaches for you. You glance up only just in time to see your sister's gigantic but relatively small hand closing in upon your far smaller body. Her hand comes over you and she picks you up at your waist between her thumb and index finger. Dad tries in vain to stop her, but Jenna turns away and looks at her friends, who have all sat up, intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to have to teach him a lesson?\" Alicia asks, twirling her hair with her finger. From between your sister's fingertips, you can see a sly smile on Alicia's lips, and her expression glows with her interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to do the honor?\" Jenna asks, causing a sinking sensation in your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait!\" you cry out. \"Don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Alicia blink and turn her gray-blue eyes upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I?\" Alicia asks, biting her lower lip and continuing to stare at your helpless body and dangling legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna then moves you toward Alicia's face, and Alicia licks her lips. You struggle desperately against your sister's grip as you see Alicia's lips part to reveal her teeth and her tongue, with its single piercing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Don't eat me!!</i>\" you cry as the tip of Alicia's tongue touches your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna then pushes you into her friend's mouth, and Alicia's closes her lips around you and your sister's fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm!\" Alicia hums with a giggle, looking mischievously back at Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that this instant!\" Dad shouts at the girls, who mostly ignore him. However, Rachael alone turns her attention to him and flicks him with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, or you'll be next,\" she says harshly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Alicia gently sucks on your body as Jenna holds onto you. You are now completely drenched in her saliva, and your sister is holding you in such a way that your face continually rubs against the teen girl's smooth, slippery tongue. She gradually sucks more forcefully on you, and in an instant Alicia manages to pull the shoes straight off your feet. Alicia makes a small delighted sound at noticing your tiny shoes along the back of her mouth, and she almost immediately swallows them, nearly pulling you from Jenna's grasp and sending you down inside of her with them. She pauses from sucking on you to giggle and then pulls Jenna's fingers out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me eat him,\" Alicia says as you hang between your sister's fingertips, dripping with Alicia's saliva. \"<i>Please?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see if you can,\" you hear Jenna say, sinking your hopes once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you are put back into Alicia's mouth, but this time Jenna holds more tightly onto you and Alicia sucks even harder to pull you from her grasp. She manages to strip your jeans and underwear from your legs, leaving your bottom half completely exposed. The sensation of her soft, warm, and smooth, wet tongue against your dick as it caresses and cradles your tiny body makes your instantly hard. Both girls notice your erection right away and become intrigued. Jenna takes you out of Alicia's mouth and holds you up for everyone to see. The girls giggle at the sight of your exposed, hard dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that turned him on,\" Camila says, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel completely humiliated, held against your will by your younger sister, with no pants and an erection, covered in a girl's saliva, and laughed at by a bunch of teenage girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well!\" Jenna says, dropping you back onto the bed and wiping her fingers on her pants. \"<i>That</i> was certainly interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cover yourself and reluctantly look to your brother and Dad, who both stand by awkwardly, looking elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you make him come?\" Rachael asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't <i>think</i> so,\" Alicia says, thinking. \"I ate his clothes, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet we can get him to come,\" Rachael says, looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without pulling his dick off?\" Alicia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would we do it?\" Camila asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could suck him off,\" Rachael answers, \"or, like, stroke him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we do it, Jenna?\" Alicia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care,\" Jenna says. \"Just not me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should take him to the bathroom and see if he can handle me,\" Rachael says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>wouldn't!</i>\" Alicia gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael smirks and puts her face close to you. You can feel her warm breath upon your soaked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you tell me what you want me to do?\" Rachael says. \"Should I jerk you off or give you a BJ? Or do you think you can make <i>me</i> come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, feeling everyone's eyes on you. Your dick is harder than ever, as is evident to all. Rachael's green eyes drill through you, awaiting your answer. She is the most naturally beautiful of all the girls, and she has a charm that could break you even if you weren't just one inch tall. Worst of all, she knows it, and the smirk on her lips frightens you.</span></div></div>",

This time around, you awkwardly toss down a raisin to Alicia, hoping it falls into her mouth after you release it. Fortunately, it manages to make it in, and you turn back to get more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair is pasted against your forehead with your sweat by now, and you notice that the others are tiring as well. Dad is panting heavily, more out of shape than you and your brother. Seeing him taking a piece of Chex cereal to Jenna, you pick up a peanut and return to Rachael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the edge of the bed, you nearly slip. Luckily, you manage to correct yourself before you fall, and you sigh in relief as you send the peanut down into Rachael's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you turn around, you notice your dad suddenly slip upon the slope, and before you can even react, he has tripped off of the edge of the bed and fallen. Your eyes widen in horror and you quickly look over the edge of the bed. You watch helplessly as Dad drops into your younger sister's open mouth, along with the piece of cereal he had brought. Jenna's lips come together and her mouth closes around him. You cannot believe what you are seeing as you watch your sister's mouth calmly move up and down, eating your dad alive. You can hear crunching sounds as she chews, and you have no idea whether they are from his body being ground apart of just the Chex cereal. Worst of all, your sister seems unaware that her dad has fallen into her mouth, and she casually swallows him and reopens her mouth for more food without any knowledge of what has happened. You feel horrified for your dad, wondering what must have gone through his mind upon seeing himself sinking down into his own daughter's mouth and then being promptly crushed between her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall back in shock and grab at your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid that really just happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you hear Bronson shouting from what seems to be far away. However, when you turn towards the sound of his voice, you are startled to find him next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad...\" you struggle to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Bronson asks, looking around. \"Where is...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization slowly sinks into your brother's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\" he starts to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad fell,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down...there?\" Bronson asks, looking in horror at the girls below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and Bronson is stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but,\" Bronson stutters, \"is he...OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly shake your head, and at the same instant you see Camila sitting up to face you and your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're just sitting here,\" she says, and soon the other three are up and investigating the situation as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we say you guys could stop?\" Rachael says. \"You don't get to take a break!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Jenna and then glance down to her stomach. You stare at her lean waist and wonder about your dad. Somewhere, inside of Jenna's stomach, is Dad. Or, what once was him. You shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your dad already ran off,\" Alicia notes, glancing at Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he--\" Bronson begins to say. However, Camila flicks him in the head with her finger, and he falls down, clutching at his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're terrible at this,\" Rachael says. \"Maybe we should put them in with the rest of the trail mix and see how long they survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two better pick up the pace,\" Jenna says. \"If we have to pause the movie again, we'll make things far worse for you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp as the girls lay back down. Nearby, Bronson glances over at you, his face bruised and his nose both broken and bleeding. You slowly get up, realizing things may not be getting better anytime soon. Bronson may not be as much help anymore, and Dad is no longer around to help. But, all four girls still must be fed. You hurry to the snack mix.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With your father..... gone and your brother currently disabled, it fell to you to feed all four of the girls.... a gargantuan task, but a vital one for your health. Seeing all four mouths open, definately turned up the pressure causing the pace of your work to be hurried. Grabbing some M&amp;Ms you toss one down, to your sister, and then one for Rachel, and finally one for Camila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm waiting!\" Alicia said annoyed and turning around at you. It's rather funny she did not look annoyed, she had a rather mischievous smile plastered on her face.  \"It's not that hard. Here let me help you!\" With faux aggravation she turned her entire body around and put her face eye level with you and opened her mouth, with a hungry look. She held her tongue out as well as you looked back to her, looking at it was over 10 times your size and you could easily fall in and be no less than a snack for it. Grabbing another M&amp;M you trudged and trudged across the bed toward the canyon where she remained tongue wiggling in anticipation. With a simple throw you landed the snack on her tongue and it rolled down her tongue like it was bowling lane and disappeared into the void. Standing right next to the edge her mouth reopened and her tongue leaned out to right next to you almost tasting you. Turning around to get back to the snack only to be assaulted by one Alicia's finger tapping you toward her open mouth! Your balance was thrown quite off and you found yourself nearly face planting onto her tongue. Getting back on your feet you looked back toward Alicia with her smile being tinted with disappointed, before she came closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" she whispered that only you could hear her, \"Let me get a little taste\" She pointed to her tongue which laid flat on the bed right at your feet. With a terrified expression on your face you looked around at the other girls to see if they were even paying attention, and surprisingly they were. Your sister Jenna was looking directly at you, while Camila was placing her hand toward grabbing your brother. Rachel had grabbed out what appeared to be a sketching pad, and was shifting her eyes from the pad to Camila and Brandon. Alicia had not waited for you and instead retracted her tongue and began closing distance with you lips puckered. Her lips basically engulfed you and the tongue once again came out spice up the kiss even more. The terror you felt, was overcome by the feeling of lips and tongue against your small body. Her licks were slow and covered your entire body, and her lips were so soft and gently caressed you, in a slow deliberate way. You found yourself more and more drawn into the feeling of this sensual embrace, and as it ended you felt a little bit of longing... until your head finally snapped back into reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you really enjoyed that\" your sister snickered as you found your bearings again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know for a fact I did\" replied Alicia glancing back at your sister before re-locking eyes on you. She had a beauty that was almost like that of an enchantress out of a storybook. This to you was magnified according to you, and to make the \"spell\" even stronger she gave you a \"small\" kiss before returning to the normal distance she remained at. You became more and more entranced in Alicia as she smiled toward you that you almost didn't hear her ask, \"Hey Jenna. Can I just have your brother? I really want to have him on my lips and you never know what might happen\" She giggled upon saying this and it took a few moment for her words to sink into your head before the fear returned. \"I guess\" Jenna replied, \"It looks like Camila is already going to town on Brandon anyway, so why not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes immediately flew to Camila who already had your brother half-way into her mouth and slurped him in right in front of your eyes. A small bulge appeared soon after in her throat and slowly drifted down to her stomach. Meanwhile Rachel still sketching out something was looking out toward Camilla. \"I think I got a good picture of it\" Rachel mused, \"Bet I could draw better if I could feel it as well\" Looking over toward you. Alicia said, \"Sorry Rachel... but this one is mine\" and you felt a familiar slimy appendage reassert dominance over you. You watched in horror and mystique as she began pulling you in the cavern she called her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you on her tongue completely submerging you in saliva, you could hear the soft purr like sounds of satisfaction echoing deafeningly throughout her mouth. You were thrown into the inside of her cheek muscles, plastered against the roof of her mouth, and placed in every imaginable spot across, on, and under her tongue. Spinning you around and around, you found yourself tumbling toward the tip of her tongue once again, and you were re-acquainted with the light of outside. Where the all eyes glimpse you with devious smile for but a moment, before her tongue curled back and reentered its natural habitat. As you felt yourself unfurling with the tongue the angle of her mouth became incredibly steep as if, no most assuredly, she was swallowing you! With all your strength you braced against the tongue for dear life, praying that you would be able to withstand the force of the suction. Your beliefs were quickly dashed as you plummeted  down, down, and down into her throat at such a velocity that you were dead just by the impact of hitting her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so great!\" Alicia exclaimed exuberantly. Camila added, \"Just the thing to get over a ex\" she laughed with that remark. Rachel scoffed, \" If we ever find your Dad it will be my turn next!\" and with that they all returned to watching the movie they had stopped. And that dear viewers leads us to......</span></div></div>",

She once again chews into it and then spits it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>God damn it!</i>\" she shouts, turning back to you. \"You did that on <i>purpose!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slams her fist on top of you, striking you into the bed. You bounce back onto it relatively unharmed, but your upper arm is sore from the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hurt me!\" you cry out, shielding yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna!\" Dad calls out at your angry sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should kill you,\" Jenna says to you. \"Maybe I should feed you to their dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Alicia says, grabbing Jenna's arm as she reaches for you. \"I've got a better idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Alicia says, smirking. You watch as she stands up and walks to a nearby plastic set of drawers. She takes something out of it and returns. Then, she places two flat, red suckers in plastic wrappers into Jenna's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your idea?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really evil,\" Alicia says, giggling, \"but suck on both of those and then stick him between them. Kinda sandwich him. Then...you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna's eyes light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>love</i> that idea!\" she exclaims, turning back to you. \"Oh, you <i>really</i> messed up now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart begins to race. Are they serious? Jenna pulls the plastic wrappers off of the suckers and then sticks them both into her mouth, eyeing you as she does so. Her lips curve into a smile, and then she pulls the suckers from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you do it, Jenna!\" Dad demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Jenna takes you in one of her hands and then pressed your struggling body against the sticky surface of one of the suckers, leaving only your head exposed. Then, she plants the other sucker over your back, encasing your helpless body between them. You gaze up in horror as your sister's smirking lips part to await you, with her friends excitedly watching behind her. Then, you are sent towards Jenna's open mouth, and into it you are placed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, you become drenched in your sister's saliva, and her warm tongue slides over your face. Jenna returns to watching the movie as she idly sucks on you, only opening her mouth occasionally to allow you desperately needed air. Time drags on and you can feel the candy slowly dissolving around you. Soon it is no longer covering your shoulders, and after a few more moments, you are able to free your arms. However, the movie has drawn in your sister's attention, and the thought of her brother inside of her mouth has slipped to the back of her mind. You are nearly free of the candy's sticky grip when Jenna subconsciously sends the suckers into her cheek and crushes the remnant between her teeth. The hard candy shatters around you, but your sister continues to chew. You cry out, wondering if she has forgotten about you. You soon learn the answer for yourself, though, when the sharp edge of one of Jenna's molars clamps down upon your forearm and cuts off one of your hands. You cry out in pain, but you are sent swirling around in her saliva and are placed once again onto your sister's teeth. This time, her tooth separates your other arm and a leg from your body, and the pain seems almost unbearable. You call out desperately, but a second later, Jenna's sinks her teeth into your face and chest, and the life sinks out of your body. She continues to crunch you apart before swallowing what is left of you, mixed in with the sweet cherry candy and her own saliva. It is not until the movie is over that she remembers you, and by then it is far too late.</span></div></div>",

You follow him and try to keep up with his pace. Behind you, in the dining room, Mom and Dani still talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father's not answering my texts, either,\" Mom says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDani strokes Mittens' ears, still holding her in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think they went?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It's...all very strange. This isn't like him at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Dani exclaims, jumping back from where she stood. \"Looks like they didn't get rid of the bugs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor, a spider crawls past its crushed relative. Seeing its movement, Mittens leaps from Dani's grasp to the floor. Then, she sits down next to the spiders and examines it curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, Mittens,\" Dani says to the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Mittens extends her paw toward the spider. It quickly changes directions and tries to flee from Mittens, but the cat quickly pounces on it and begins to nibble on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mittens! Don't eat it! It's a spider!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, your and your dad continue to make your way across the living room to Jenna's flats. However, you both are unaware that Mom has walked into the living room and noticed Jenna's shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna!\" you and Dad hear Mom calling up the stairs. \"You know you're not supposed to leave your shoes at the door!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of you, Dad grins at you over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you I know that woman. We've been married for 20 years, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we don't make it in time?\" you ask, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hurry!\" Dad responds, facing forward again and picking up his pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you both reach your sister's flats, which are each easily the size of a building at your size. They are completely black and fairly worn. You also become well aware of the smell that emanates from them, especially the shoe on its side with the inside exposed to you. You know Jenna does not normally wear socks with her flats, and the warm air with the smell of her feet, sweat, and leather reaches your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're bigger than I thought,\" Dad answers. \"I'd say we could grab onto the laces...but I'm worried about losing our grip in the air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strokes his chin, thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could also try calling to her when she comes,\" he adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if she doesn't recognize us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be bad,\" Dad comments. \"The only other thing I can think of is climbing into that shoe. We should be safer that way...assuming she doesn't put them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both hear Jenna coming down the stairs, and you realize you're running low on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we _____.\"</span></div></div>",

You close your eyes, feeling your stomach churn, and you can feel your sister dashing back up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds which seem longer than they actually were, Jenna has arrived in her room, and she tosses her shoes. This last fling sends both you and your dad flying across the room. You both cry out as you soar, tumbling through the air, until you land and bounce upon something soft. Lying face-down, you are only just regaining your composure when you are sent bouncing up again. This time, when you fall back down against the soft fabric beneath you, you can see that you and your dad are on Jenna's bed, which she has also laid down upon. However, she has stripped out of her pants, which now lay in a bundle near the closed door, and her panties are nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unknowingly stare as you see Jenna's pussy for the first time in your life. She is completely shaved, and her legs are spread and bent, with her bare feet flat on the blankets. She caresses her clit and your mouth slightly falls open. A tremor shakes through one of her legs and she stretches out, moaning quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as you remain unaware of yourself, you see her insert her fingers into her vagina. She murmurs, trying to remain quiet while also feeling very aroused. A strange sensation passes over you as well as you see your sister pleasuring herself. You feel the blood pulsing into your dick, but you are very conflicted. This is your <i>sister,</i> but seeing her getting off is also getting you going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally return to your senses when your dad grabs your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, son! Now's definitely not the time to get her attention!\" he says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you both turn away from Jenna, she stretches out her leg and unknowingly lays it down upon you and your dad. Trapped beneath her calf, you both are unable to get free. She then reaches into the end table beside her bed and pulls out a skin-colored dildo. When she removes her leg from upon you, she sits on her heels and inserts the dildo into her pussy. You and Dad start to run again, but Jenna's sudden ferocity causes the bed to shake, and you are both knocked over. Even worse, every bounce of the bed sends you and Dad rolling back towards Jenna, whose body sinks into the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moans become more frequent and you both continue to struggle not to fall underneath of Jenna.</span></div></div>",

Just then, though, she kneels down by Mittens, and all of her weight shifts onto the front of her feet as her heels come off the ground. Caught under the sole of Dani's foot, near her toes, you suddenly find the life being squeezed out of you. The pressure has multiplied, and your sister seems completely unaware of your existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear her arguing with Mittens and you can only hope that she will let off of you before she completely crushes you. However, a stumble forward as she tries to pull Mittens' snack from her mouth ends up nearly killing you. For just a second, almost all of her weight is centered on your lower body. Even with the padding of the carpet beneath you, the pressure is too much. You feel Dani's foot squish your legs. You feel your pants become very warm with your blood, and finally Dani steps off of you. But, it is too late--you have no feeling left in your legs, and blood is pooling quickly around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a portion of your dad's body being taken from Mittens' mouth by Dani, who does not really care so much what the cat is eating as much as the fact that she is eating something she shouldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew,\" Dani says, unaware that she has part of her own dad's chewed apart body on her fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrossed out by the indiscernible mess, Dani wipes her fingertips across the carpet, smearing part of her dad across the floor. Seeing that Mittens has swallowed the rest of the \"spider,\" though, Dani gets up and walks to the bathroom to wash her hands. She unknowingly leaves you alone with Mittens, who sees you lying helpless nearby in your own blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your vision begins to fade from blood loss, you see Mittens settle in next to you and feel her begin to nibble at your body. You pass out, but you don't last much longer as she brings you into her mouth and chews you to pieces before swallowing you. She continues to lick your blood from the carpet until Dani returns and shoos her. However, by this time, most of what was once you and your dad are easily inside of Mittens' stomach.</span></div></div>",

She then puts it to her ear and waits for an answer on the other line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have your phone with you, Dad?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he can answer, you both hear the ringtone on his phone playing from up ahead. Then, you see that your mom has heard it as well, and she has already began walking toward the couch, where the phone is laying on a cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad! Watch out!\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both instinctively drop down as your mom moves toward you. At the end of her long, soaring leg, her foot (still in her sandals) plants itself into the carpet mere inches from you and your dad. You both watch as her foot bends at her toes as she moves forward and then walks right over the two of you, completely oblivious to your predicament. She passes by on her way to the couch, where she sees your dad's cell phone and lowers her own from her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dad left his phone behind, too,\" Mom says to Dani, who is still in the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Dad see her sigh, and you feel you can almost read her thoughts from her expression. It's little things, she must be thinking, but if only he would be more responsible to his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at your dad, you realize you've never had any problem with him, but it's true that he does sometimes do things of his own accord without considering how they will impact the rest of the family. Still, he's always been a hero to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go,\" he says, breaking the silence. \"It's too bad about the phone, but worrying about it now won't solve anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you reach the couch, you both take cover underneath it. Above you, your mom has sat down on the couch. She has one leg stretched upon the ottoman and the other planted on the floor. From underneath the couch, you can see her unconsciously playing with her sandal, slipping her foot in and out of it. You can also hear her on the phone with someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" she says. \"It's Renee. Do you know where Calvin is or where he might be right now? ... I don't know. We were using one of Roger's bug bombs to clear the house. We have a bug problem, and--anyway, we came back to pick them up and he and the boys are gone. ... Yeah, but his phone's still here. His truck, too. ... Right? But, yeah, I don't know where they've-- ... Only a few minutes. Since I got here at least. ... I know, it's just...I'm worried. He does things like this, but this time...it seems different. ... OK. ... Yeah, I'll try. ... Thanks. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've really gone and worried your mother this time,\" Dad says, looking at you. \"I have, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you said, though, we can't worry about that stuff right now,\" you reply. \"If we can get her attention, she can help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad half-smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But the way I see it, we only have a few good options here.\"</span></div></div>",

Idolizing his older brother, who seemed to excel at everything he did, Calvin made a name for himself in school due to his outstanding ability to learn even advanced concepts. Like his brother, Calvin went out for sports, but a severe foot injury ended his athletic career early. He devoted himself instead to his studies, always encouraged but never pressured by his parents. Secretly, he resented them for not having high expectations for him, but the family almost never argued and both Calvin and his brother seemed model children to others. Graduating at the top of his class, Calvin went to college with multiple interests, eventually settling on engineering. During his years as an undergrad, he met his future wife, Renee, who was just a teenager at the time. Initially, he felt the age gap between them was off-putting, but he quickly developed feelings for her as he helped her through her problems at home. They married a few years after they met and he encouraged her to take college classes in order to better herself. The couple would eventually have two boys and two girls: you, Jenna, Bronson, and Dani.</span></div></div>",

As such, Renee often did the most housework, including cooking and cleaning, as well as taking care of her younger sister. Despite the family's struggles, Renee was always happy as a girl. However, in her teenage years, she felt stressed by all of her responsibilities, and she rebelled by staying away from home often. During high school, she met Calvin, her future husband, who was six years older than her\u00e2\u0080\u0094a fact which did not sit well with her father. Finally driven to run away from home, Renee moved in with Calvin and finished high school, due mostly to Calvin's persistence for her to do so. They married shortly after she had graduated high school and he had earned his degree. They struggled early in their marriage with balancing taking care of their first child and continuing their education. Renee eventually became a nurse, though, and her husband an engineer, and together they had four children: you, Jenna, Bronson, and Dani.</span></div></div>",

Those black-haired boys slouching against the faded green wall of lockers seem to all have a nervous twitch which makes them fling their bangs away from their eyes. A girl nearby reeks of parking lot smoke breaks mixed with excessive cheap perfume, and her outfit suggests she already knows what she will be doing when she drops out from school. Why are those giggly cheerleaders barefoot? At least nothing will get between their developing breasts and mustachioed Principal Hackett's eyes, but a brigade of gun-wielding children could probably march by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you graduated, you had vowed to never again come back to this miserable branch office of Hell. Is this your life now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna continues to walk through the hallway with her gorgeous best friend Alicia, blabbing away without any idea of your predicament. Maybe it was just temporary. If the illness had shrunk you down this small in just one night, maybe a day of rest would return you to normal. But could logic be applied in this situation? Who ever heard of a shrinking sickness in the first place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar face flashes before your eyes--at least, one that you are excited to see again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that Ms. J.?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing carried by Jenna, you only catch a glimpse of your former student-teacher. She must have been hired, you think. Ms. J. might be the only ray of hope in this hopeless school. A doe-eyed, brunette goddess with an absolutely perfect, lean physique and a heart-meltingly sweet smile. Not to mention so humble and insanely smart (she had a perfect ACT score in high school.) And her name was <i>Hanna!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. J. was the sole reason the spring semester grades of your entire sixth-period senior English class torpedoed so drastically. The guys couldn't keep their eyes or minds off of her, and the girls bitched jealously that the guys were no longer catering to their every whim. You were captivated by the creativity she showed with every unique outfit and hairstyle she came to school with each day, and she did all this when you could barely roll out of bed at 8 each morning! You had only barely graduated because your English grade dipped the warmer the weather became. The winter boots and scarves began to give way to flats and short skirts in the spring, and each new month revealed more of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to your senses to find that everything is suddenly strangely dark. Were you daydreaming the entire day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, and in the distance high above and to your right are three horizontal lines through which light shines. It takes a second to process, but you realize that Jenna must have hung up her backpack in her locker. You don't even remember her leaving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no desire to remain in place for the next eight hours, you decide to finally climb out of the side pocket. The netting reminds you of the cargo net on the playground in your elementary years. You awkwardly scale it and then peek over the edge, yet you can only barely see what is below. There seems to be a deep drop from your sister's backpack to the bottom of the locker, but months of returned homework assignments she plans to \"someday\" organize provide a padding at the bottom. You let yourself drop, feeling a bit anxious, but you safely land below, bouncing upon Jenna's bad grades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you walk towards the bent corner of the locker door. Quality has always been what Westwood High stands for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop a short distance from Jenna's locker to the tile floor of the hallway and realize there's no going back. A late student walks by you, completely unaware of your tiny presence. The size of his converse sneakers alone as he passes in front of you is both frightening and remarkable. What a strange perspective. It would make for an interesting story if not for all of the danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around. The hallway is relatively quiet now. Nobody is in sight, but you don't care about him anyway. The only sounds come from the classrooms. The room you believe you saw Ms. J. in is a considerable distance away. The entrance to the cafeteria is right across the hall, and the gym is around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly realize all your options. At your size, things could get very interesting. As long as you aren't noticed by anyone, which was never a problem before, you could do almost anything you want!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think. Where to begin?</span></div></div>",

But this is real life, so something like that would never happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing this, you quickly make your way toward the nearest exit on your right. At the end of the dim, dreary hallway are two glass doors through which the glorious light of the outside world shines. The trees, though technically still part of school grounds, blow gently with the warm late-summer breeze. Squirrels frolic in the joy of their freedom, and the morning sun smiles at you. Its rays burst out beyond the houses of the neighborhood as if reaching out to welcome a long-lost son. You run towards the light. I'm coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all of a sudden a shoe slams down in front of you. You look up from the black high-heeled shoe, gazing up the slender golden-tanned leg, and pretend not to take in the up-skirt view of the woman towering over you with her hands on her hips and a frown on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring down at you, she blows a stray lock of hair from her face and shakes her head at you, as if <i>you</i> were the one who decided not to wear underwear with a mini-skirt and stand over a shrunken guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you <i>doing?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" you answer, wondering if your eyes are crossed as you try to look at both her eyes and at the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What?</i>\" she asks, cupping her ear and bending down closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nothing!</i>\" you repeat louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that <i>certainly</i> appears to be the case!\" she snorts. \"Why are you not in class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a student here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a student here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowns again and stares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're a trespasser?\" she asks. \"What's your business here? Have you come to spy on teenage girls, you pervert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No!\" you answer. \"Is...is not fazing you at all that I'm <i>shrunk?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is <i>very</i> fazing to me that you're shrunk,\" she replies. \"It seems almost as if you've purposely come here fazed like that to do...<i>fazing</i> things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along now,\" she says, bending down beside you. \"Westwood High does not allow perverts to roam its halls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches toward you and you watch her hand open before you, her long, manicured nails and slender fingers giving way to her thin, white palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You can't just--\" you start to say, only to be ignored and pushed into the woman's hand. She stands back up and walks away with you, holding you very awkwardly against the cold palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, she drops you onto the top of a dark, wooden desk, from which you can see your least favorite principal of Westwood High, Mr. Hackett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this suspicious pervert in the hallway,\" the woman says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I remember you,\" Mr. Hackett says to you, leaning back in his chair. \"You graduated from here the spring before last. Mediocre grades, strong case of senioritis, fantastically unspectacular in sports. Yes--your sister is Jenna, and your brother is Bronson. I remember you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns in his chair, stroking his mustache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he repeats. \"You...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares at the wall, and both you and the woman wait for him to continue. He doesn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Hackett?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stirs suddenly, startled from his deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrm?\" he says, looking around with wide eyes. \"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do with this pervert here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I was just trying to remember the name of this pervert here,\" Mr. Hackett says. \"His time here at Westwood High wasn't very memorable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a pervert!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What?</i>\" Mr. Hackett and the woman ask in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for fuck's sake!\" you mutter under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, we do <i>not</i> tolerate foul language here at Westwood High,\" Mr. Hackett announces, standing suddenly upright from his chair. \"Ms. Carroll, please put this pervert here in detention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not even--\" you start to argue, stumbling over your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure he is <i>thoroughly</i> disciplined, Ms. Carroll,\" Mr. Hackett says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she answers, picking you back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, Ms. Carroll?\" Mr. Hackett says as she starts to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Hackett?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>love</i> your outfit today,\" he tells her, stroking his mustache approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!\" she says, blushing. \"So kind of you to notice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrm,\" Mr. Hackett says. \"Now, please escort that...<i>disgusting</i> pervert to detention.\"</span></div></div>",

Eventually you hear her opening a door, though, and a few seconds later, you are once again dropped onto a desk. This time, however, you are on top of a student desk, in the middle of a classroom. At the desk in front of you, a very large girl with several stomach folds and a monster of a pimple on the tip of her nose turns around and sneers at you. Ms. Carroll pivots on the heel of her shoe and walks away, leaving you in the midst of a classroom with no visible teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, hot stuff,\" the girl in front of you says, puckering her lips and expelling a cloud of sour breath in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! <i>No!</i> I did not come all this way for <i>that!</i>\" you shout, turning away. However, you suddenly recognize the face of your brother seated at the desk behind yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Bronson?</i>\" you ask, surprised. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" he answers. \"I come here every day, unless it's the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\" you say. Then, you shake your head. \"No, listen. You've got to help me get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, I can't do that. I'd get in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you say, staring at him. \"You're in <i>detention!</i> You're <i>already</i> in trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen. Just tell me how to get out of here. I'll do it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. But you better hurry. The teacher this period is a real witch,\" he says. At the same instant, a deer-in-the-headlights look comes over his face and he turns red. \"I mean...hitch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are confused by Bronson's change in demeanor but then notice someone standing beside you. You glance over and have to double-take before you realize it's Ms. J.! You stare up at your beautiful former student-teacher and a sense of relief fills your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Thank God. It's you!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've joined us all in detention today,\" Ms. J. says. \"I thought you had graduated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turns her attention to your brother, who remains visibly flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I <i>thought</i> I heard <i>you</i> telling your brother something about me?\" she asks him, with a finger on her cheek. \"I'm a 'real witch?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no,\" Bronson stutters. \"I said 'hitch.' It's...slang...for 'a real nice woman.' Like...someone to get hitched with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" Ms. J. asks, cocking her head and smiling. \"That's so nice of you, Bronson, but I'm really too old for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...didn't mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronson stops talking and hangs his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. J.,\" you say, bringing her attention back to you. \"This whole thing has been a misunderstanding. I've been shrunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't think anyone misunderstands that,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no...you've got to help me,\" you continue. \"I'm not even supposed to be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" she begins, inspecting her clipboard. \"No, it says here you were planning to commit lewd acts of pervertry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks back to you from the clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Westwood High doesn't allow perverts to roam its halls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, I know. No perverts in the halls,\" you say. \"But I'm not a pervert! This is a <i>huge</i> misunderstanding! I was on my way out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't lie,\" Ms. J. says. \"You're looking up at my breasts right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I <i>have</i> to look up to <i>see</i> you!\" you argue, exasperated. \"I'm <i>one freaking inch tall!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need you to calm down,\" Ms. J. says. \"We don't speak to each other like that here.

You feel very awkward, aware of all of the eyes on you. Plus, at your size, what can you do to stand up for yourself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've forced my hand,\" Ms. J. says. She then reaches out and picks you up. You struggle against her, but she restrains your arms as she pulls off your shoes. Then, she tugs at your pants and strips them off. Once she has your boxers off, she readjusts you in her fingertips and thoughtlessly places one of her fingers upon your groin. The sudden touch of her warm, soft fingertip upon your dick sends it flinging upward. Your shirt is off within a second, and when Ms. J. places you back onto the desk, you find yourself standing naked in front of the entire classroom of onlooking, laughing students, and to make things worse, you have a boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this some kind of bad dream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" Ms. J. exclaims, noticing your hard dick. Her hands immediately go to her hips, and she frowns, staring down at you. \"Now this is supposed to be <i>punishment;</i> you're not supposed to be <i>getting turned on</i> by it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl-thing in front of you has stuffed her arm into her pants and snorts with glee as she eyes you. Behind you, your brother stares, his jaw dropped. Girls and boys throughout the class are laughing and whispering to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm at a loss for words!\" Ms. J. declares. \"This calls for <i>extreme punishment!</i> I'm going to have to confine you while I go find out what this situation calls for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches for you, hesitates, and then very carefully takes you by the arm. She then carries you across the room, and you feel as if you're going to be separated at your shoulder. After a few seconds of dangling through the air, you are put into a guinea pig cage upon a countertop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't leave me in here!\" you complain. \"What if I get eaten while you're gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that,\" Ms. J. replies. \"We don't actually have a guinea pig. These troublesome kids would probably kill it when there is no teacher supervising them. We just have a conveniently-placed guinea pig cage. Now, please excuse me while I leave the room and find out what I should do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" you shout, but Ms. J. doesn't seem to hear you. You watch as she leaves the room and closes the door behind her. Then, you notice that the entire class is still watching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. J. is gone,\" one student whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means we can do terrible things to the naked kid,\" another says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry! Someone take him out of the cage and hide him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the students immediately stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? I'm not doing it. I'll get expelled, and then I'll have to flip burgers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I vote that Andrea does it. She's closest to the cage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in favor say 'Aye.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye!\" most of the class chimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I voted <i>I</i> because <i>I</i> want him for <i>myself,</i>\" the gross girl says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Bertha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Majority rule,\" a student says. \"Andrea has to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't get to vote!\" Andrea says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just <i>do it!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl named Andrea turns toward you. You are a bit surprised by what you see. She is a fairly-attractive, skinny girl with long brown hair, black square glasses, cute brown eyes, and very little makeup other than eyeliner and lip gloss. She opens the guinea pig cage and takes you into her warm and small but very soft hands. You both awkwardly look at each other--you in all of your naked glory and her...holding you as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns back to the class, unsure of what to do with you.

That means, <i>girls</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, Ms. Carroll!\" Mr. Hackett intervenes. \"As...helpful as that would be, the school would probably face a lawsuit if we demanded our students to expose themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...only extends to <i>female</i> students, right?\" Ms. J. asks nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Hackett chuckles and places a large hand on Ms. J.'s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a new teacher, so I don't expect you to know <i>everything,</i> Ms. Jorgenson,\" he answers. \"Now, I'm no expert in law, but this school is a devout follower of the indisputable ideology of feminism. Allow me to enlighten you with the fact that there is only one 'gender,' and <i>that</i> is <i>female.</i> However, in the case of the <i>lesser sex</i>, we no longer refer to them as 'male.' The politically correct term is 'subgender.' And, to answer a question you didn't ask, nobody cares about the subgender. So, you have nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. J. sighs in relief, and Mr. Hackett turns to Ms. Carroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I say that correctly?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As well as can be expected,\" Ms. Carroll responds with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do about the missing pervert then, Mr. Hackett?\" Ms. J. asks. \"He could be back in the hallways, violating our esteemed students!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must <i>not</i> panic,\" he answers. \"I trust our student population to enforce fair and forceful punishment upon that detestable pervert. We should remain calm and collected, but--Ms. Carroll? Please make an immediate announcement over the intercom that anyone bringing the pervert to justice, dead or in pieces, will receive a reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of reward?\" a student asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Children should be <i>seen</i> and not <i>heard,</i>\" Mr. Hackett retorts sternly, glaring at the student. Then, he turns back to the staff. \"Any further questions? If I am needed, I will be in the girls' locker room, overseeing the construction of the security cameras being put up for our student population's protection. Please excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep fighting the Lord's battle!\" Ms. Carroll calls after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amen!\" Mr. Hackett replies, pumping his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Carroll soon leaves the room as well, realizing she has no other purpose for staying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class, I'm going to conveniently leave the room to use the restroom,\" Ms. J. announces. \"Please continue to work on your assignments and stay in your seats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Ms. J. leaves, the students turn their attention to Andrea. Within her bra, you motorboat one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounds like my time here is about up, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reward is mine,\" Andrea says, standing up. \"He's in <i>my</i> bra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fair!\" a student whines. \"I <i>always</i> get what I want, and I want that <i>reward!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl nearby reaches out and grabs Andrea's breasts, and the two girls struggle as you find yourself being squeezed and pressed between Andrea's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him to me!\" the girl demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Andrea shouts. \"I'm <i>popular</i> and you <i>aren't!</i> Plus my boobs are <i>at least</i> a size bigger than yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with anything?\" a boy whispers to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows? They're girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quite enjoy your position during the fight, but you also understand that things will get worse if you don't get away. So, you start to slide yourself down along Andrea's breast, past her history homework, which you notice she will not be getting a good grade on. 'What year was the War of 1812?' Come on! That's a gimme! Once you reach the bottom of her bra, you look down and plan your drop. Then, you slide down her lean stomach to the waistband of her jeans. From there, you strafe along to her back and then climb down her small but firm ass, out of the sight of the other students. You make your way down the leg of her jeans and then drop to the floor. Then, you run, still naked, towards a nearby door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! He's escaping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students turn their attention to you just as you reach the door, and you frantically try to squeeze yourself underneath it. You make it to the other side at the same instant that several students jolt to the door and try to grab you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try <i>opening</i> it, dummy,\" one student says, standing nearby and shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother stands up and tries the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's <i>locked,</i> stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where does it go to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to run in the dark room past the door, you hear another student answer, \"_____.\"</span></div></div>",

I aim to encompass a wide variety of interesting circumstances for an average person whose life changes when he is reduced to a fraction of his normal height. I try to write \"realistic choices,\" that is to say options from the protagonist's point of view. I believe this builds suspense and intrigue, rather than simply projecting what will happen in the next chapter. For example, a choice such as \"Hide in her food\" is both an \"unrealistic\" choice for someone in this hypothetical situation and makes for a protagonist who seems oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilarly, I will write chapters with the idea of \"realism\" of death in mind, as well, and I would prefer additions to keep this element of the story going too, so as to have continuity with the rest of the story for the readers. What \"realism\" in death means to me is fairly self-explanatory. A shrunken person--in this case a one inch tall young man--is highly unlikely to survive being chewed apart, digested, stepped on, or many other scenarios common to shrinking fantasies. The protagonist <i>might</i> survive, but I will generally include reasons to maintain the \"realism.\" To illustrate, perhaps the protagonist survives being stepped on by only coming in contact with the arch of someone's foot or having the impact reduced by carpet. Or the protagonist is swallowed alive--though in this case I would write in a death by digestion or suffocation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tl;dr: This story aims for \"realism\" in its choices and death scenarios. Please also consider this concept when adding chapters to maintain continuity.</i></div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a onclick=\"$('#dropNote2').toggle (200);\" style=\"cursor:pointer;color:#0000ff;\" title=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><b>Rules</b></span> <span style=\"font-size:8pt;opacity:.75;text-decoration:none;\">\u25bc</span></a><div id=\"dropNote2\" style=\"padding:0px;display:none;\"><br>\r\nI do not spend enough time on this website to actively enforce rules, so I will only put forth suggested guidelines meant to make for the best possible experience for the reader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Additions with gay material, insertion, unbirth (etc.) are accepted. However, my own additions will generally only involve my interests--female vore and crush. With my understanding of this writing community, I anticipate much of the story will center around these concepts as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Please follow the suggested format of unindented paragraphs with an empty line between each paragraph. In my opinion, this makes the reading easiest on the eyes, as it separates walls of text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* I don't expect myself or other authors to be perfect writers, but I would ask for a decent effort if adding chapters. A good rule of thumb: \"write what you would want to read.\" That said, I likely won't commit time to quality control, unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tl;dr: There are no rules, but I would prefer paragraphs be separated by a blank line.
