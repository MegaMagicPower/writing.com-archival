The other Gods had moved on, finding new planets in the cosmos to create life and be worshiped under a new name. Eventually those civilizations would give up their faith and the gods would move on again. It had been this way since before this universe had existed, and they would continue to do this for all eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the some of the others, the trickster god left earth about a thousand years ago as new gods moved in. They had settled on a nice planet a few galaxies away but was kicked out of the Pantheon Early. So they were gliding across the cosmos again, when they found the planet they had left a while ago. The trickster couldn't think of the last time they returned to a planet. It was honestly by accident. Still they couldn't leave without play one small trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trickster focused on a random continent, without a target in mind. They found a young man, what was now considered an adult in this civilization, who was on their last year of high school. As the trickster was only passing through they would only do one trick but one that would affect the most amount of people. The trickster felt joy as they cursed the human and flew off into the cosmos, never to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curse in question was a chain swap, if the cursed victim touched someone else their souls would switch places. The best part is, the soul was what was cursed, not the body. They could also never go back to a body they had been in before. They would be a catalyst for chaos. The trickster placed in some conditions though, the swap would only work on humans that were considered adults and if host of the curse was killed, it would go to the last soul it interacted with. To prevent isolation of the curse, the person would die if they didn't touch another person for a period of seven days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson Dawson was an 18 year old boy, he had short red hair and had a like light layer of stubble. He was underweight as he played video games and neglected to eat when he wasn't at school. He didn't have any friends and was a major introvert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lived with his mother as well as step-father and step-sister, the later he never got along with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know it but while he was asleep the trickster cursed his soul. The next person he touched, he would swap bodies with and he'd never be able to be himself ever again.</span></div></div>",

He had slept in too much to have breakfast and had to be out the door in five minutes if he wanted to make it to school on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slept in again?\" Janice, his mother scolded as he went by the kitchen. He just gave her a light shrug and went to the front door. \"Now wait just a second...\" Janice stopped him. \"You're not leaving without giving your mother a hug are you?\" Jackson rolled his eyes and sighed. She always did this, he was an adult now, he didn't need her hugs. Still he let her embrace him just the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson suddenly felt rather dizzy and instead of having his mother's arms around him, he had his arms wrapped around his body. He released the hug and stepped back, unable to process what he was seeing. He looked down and his eyes went wide open, he had breasts and he had his mothers arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" His old cried as he was now examining the body he was in. He the looked at you. \"Jackson?\" He asked. You and your mother had just swapped bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be real...\" Jackson said. His new body was forty years old, overweight with shoulder length dirty blonde hair. She wasn't an attractive woman, but she wasn't ugly either. She was a chain smoker and had been since before Jackson was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We switched bodies... this is unreal\" his mother said as her stomach growled. \"How could you go to school like this, you're starving.\" She went back into the kitchen to make herself some toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to figure out how this happened and how to undo it...\" Jackson stomped his mother's foot and crossed his arms across his chest, an odd feeling now that he had breasts. \"Why do I feel so irritated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably the nicotine addiction,\" his mother replied. \"I haven't had a cigarette this morning... And we will figure this out. I don't want to be in this body any more than you want to be in mine. Though I have no idea how this happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either do I,\" Jackson said as he went into his mother's purse and grabbed her lighter and box of cigarettes. He promised himself he'd never smoke but this feeling he had he wanted it to go away. He went out the front and sat on the porch and began smoking. His first inhale was a bit too strong so he began coughing but he eventually got the hang of it. Taking the smoke did ease his mind a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a positive side to this at least, he didn't need to go to school now, his mother was a housewife so he could stay home all day and play his games, he just wouldn't use voice chat. But he was in the body that gave birth to him, married to a trucker. He wasn't even a man anymore and he'd probably see his mother naked, at the very least he'd need to go to the toilet as her. If he had swapped bodies with his step sister he might've been tempted to strip but as his mother that was the last thing on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get through this,\" His mother sat down next to him and held his hand. \"If we swapped, surely we can find a way to swap back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mum,\" even in each others bodies, she was a comfort to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though for now we might need to adapt to our situation, we don't know how long we might be this way.\"</span></div></div>",

Stays home today, I  don't know anything about your school life,\" Janice said with a scowl, indicating that she wished Jackson would tell her more. \"And I want to be here for you, to help with any adjustments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson nodded as he didn't know how to handle this. At least it meant they didn't need to worry about anything too major and because his mother stayed home, she was able to continue doing whatever she was doing. Jackson went back to his room and loaded up his games. It took him a little while to adjust though, seeing as he wasn't used to his mother's hands or fatter fingers and his reaction time was a littler slower. Still it felt good to kill some bots and forget about the crappy situation for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough one thing they would not be escaping was his mother's family. He didn't consider Michael to be his dad or Cynthia to be his sister but to his mother they were family. Michael wasn't a bad person, he loved Janice and truly cared for her, he was a lot harder on Jackson though. Cynthia and Jackson didn't get along but mostly avoided each other. Those two were completely different and wouldn't even socialise if their parents were married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Jackson both were out at the moment. Cynthia was also 18 and so was at school, they made their own way there and she was an early riser. Michael was out on the road but would be coming back later tonight. Jackson's face went white, he'd be sleeping in the same bed as his step-father and after a week on the road, there was likely one thing he'd have on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson needed another cigarette and so he went back out onto the porch. He didn't even know how to bring this up with his mother, he just hoped there was a solution to this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for him, it would solve itself when...</span></div></div>",

I'd often then imagine a swap taking place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the conditions can no longer be met the person will not be able to switch back. So for the first example if the person was fired before they quit, they'd be stuck as each other.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You have twenty-four hours from midnight to play the first round. As for the game itself... well I\u2019m feeling a tad mischievous today. Call me childish but I\u2019ve always enjoyed a good game of hide and seek. With the special stipulations I\u2019ve included I think this game could turn out to be very interesting indeed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd remember, twenty-four hours or you\u2019re <i>mine</i>. Chop chop...\u201d There was a collective gasp as the shadowy figure folder in on himself, scrunching themself so tight that they eventually disappeared from existence. The twelve patrons looked at each other in shocked silence. All was quiet but the rustle of the wind as each tried to gather their thoughts on the situation. The majority of them seemed scared witless by the announcement. Melody looked to be the most shaken one of all of them. All eyes turned her way as she whimpered, \u201cL-like, what the f*ck?\u201d Marie, ever the caring woman, quickly moved to the blonde\u2019s side and consoled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, what she said!,\u201d Scott chimed in as he dipped his hand back into his bag of Doritos. All the others began mumbling to one another. Many of them were frightened at the figure\u2019s sudden disappearance and debated about the validity of the being\u2019s demand for them to swap bodies. Fiona was more perturbed than curious however and mumbled something to herself about having to get back to the cinema to lock up shop. \u201cCan you guys hurry this up?,\u201d she said as she looked to her watch, \u201cSome of us have homes to get to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun snorted sarcastically. \u201cSpeak for yourself, some of us ain\u2019t exactly pumped to go back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe so but her point\u2019s still good,\u201d Tyler replied as he clutched his wife\u2019s hand. Her breathing had become more ragged in the past couple minutes- the extra stress had made the baby inside her womb restless and now it was a struggle for her to regain her composure. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get you home as soon as possibleDebby and when I do, I\u2019ll run you one of those soothing bubble baths you love, okay?\u201d Debby groaned, as good a response as Tyler normally got when she was in discomfort like this. Bianca moved to Debby\u2019s side and cradled her stomach reassuringly, giving Tyler a rare opportunity to step back and take a quick rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time Brad seemed to be completely oblivious to the \u2018game\u2019 he\u2019d just been thrust into and he\u2019d quickly moved to Celine\u2019s side to try and chat her up. The 27-year-old girl seemed uncomfortable though and squirmed as Brad pushed his chiselled bicep into her eye-line. All in all, it was utter chaos. Carl meanwhile was trying to logically think of his next course of action. He whistled loudly and attracted the attentions of the other eleven attendees. Due to his wizened features and no-nonsense appearance he immediately commanded respect from his onlookers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright boys and girls,\u201d he boomed in his grizzly voice, \u201cI understand that all of us are feeling confused right about now. The main thing to remember is that we\u2019re all stuck in this crapheap together. So let\u2019s get all of our heads together and figure out what to do next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona scoffed. \u201c\u2018All in this together?,\u2019\u201d she mocked, \u201cWhat\u2019s next, taking about our crushes and painting each other\u2019s nails?\u201d Behind her Melony squealed excitedly. Fiona rolled her eyes as she grabbed her leacherous son, Jack, by the arm before he started drooling at Melony\u2019s svelte curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could exit the mall\u2019s revolving doors, Bianca stepper into her path. Her brown eyes were scrunched up in anger. She adjusted her circular spectacles before snarling, \u201cListen lady, none of us are exactly ecstatic to be in this position but the old man\u2019s right about working this out together. So <i>be quiet</i> unless you have something productive to add.\u201d Fiona raised her arms in mock surrender and walked back to the circle with her arms crossed defiantly. Carl coughed to defuse the tension. \u201cThank you, Miss...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBianca.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Bianca, apologies. Now, first order of business: that being or whatever it was told us that we all have to choose someone else here to exchange bodies with. Anyone have any idea what he means by that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott burped loudly as he finished off his Doritos pack. He cleared his throat pompously as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty self-explanatory, old man. I\u2019ve been writing bodyswap fanfics for as long as I can remember and I know every one of them starts with a situation like this.\u201d Each person in the mall looked at each other warily. \u201cWhat a bunch of bull,\u201d Brad said but it seemed like his heart wasn\u2019t in it. Bianca furrowed her brow in concentration as she replied, \u201cMaybe, maybe not. I\u2019m not so sure that we should take the risk and not follow the figure\u2019s advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby, who\u2019s been silent up to now, suddenly yelped, \u201cNo! Nuh-uh, no way am I just giving up my body and my baby to a complete stranger! No, there must be something else?!\u201d Tyler helped hoist her onto her feet and steadied her on her swollen cankles. Brad guffawed. \u201cDon\u2019t think there\u2019s a queue of people lining to look anything like you, babe,\u201d he snarked. Debby lunged at him but felt her baby bump writhe once more. Soon everyone was locked into a heated argument on the idea of having to trade bodies with each other. Some suggested an equity system where the physically disadvantaged took first dibs, others suggested pulling straws and a couple even advocated for random selection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the bickering bunch had forgotten about Fiona\u2019s mischievous offspring, Jack. In the midst of the melee he\u2019d slipped away and was admiring everyone for his own choice. <i>Who to pick?,</i> he thought to himself. There were too many viable candidates to pick from so he excluded the don\u2019ts first and foremost. He ruled out Carl, Marie and Scott right away- the first two were rusty old codgers and the latter was little more than a glorified man-baby. He was tempted to pick either Brad or Tyler because of their matured physiques but how many opportunities would he get to experience being in a girl\u2019s body. He wasn\u2019t for stealing his mom\u2019s body, ew, and although he liked the size of Debby\u2019s engorged milk puppies he didn\u2019t want to have to risk having her baby. That was an experience that he was completely fine with missing out on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe surveyed the other three ladies. Sure Bianca and Celine were attractive in their own rights but Jack was all about the body and in that area Melony was clearly superior. He didn\u2019t know how the process worked though. He scrunched his face tight and imagined himself being the former prom-Queen. Sure enough, he began to feel an intense tingling running along his body. He felt as the energy courses through his veins, reshaping and rebuilding his bones and tissue. He laughed as his short dark hair lengthened and cascaded down his back. He could feel his bones cracking as he shrunk down half a foot or so to Melony\u2019s height. His hips widened as he felt the flesh on his backside balloon and swell outwards. His giggles turned even more girlish as he lost his voice box and his face reconstructed itself, rounding out and becoming more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked down on himself in shocked awe. His modest t-shirt completely swamped his new form and the Levi\u2019s on his legs pooled around the hem of his waist. \u201cOh my days, holy sh..!,\u201d he was exclaiming before he suddenly vanished from the balcony he was standing on. There was no trace of his disappearance apart from the clothes he\u2019d been wearing that collapsed to the marble floor in his place. A couple moments later and the rest of the group ceased their arguments as a bloodcurdling scream echoed round the plaza. They turned and gaped in horror as they saw the absurd image of Jack\u2019s body in an eerily familiar crop top and booty shorts combo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon?,\u201d Fiona asked warily. Jack\u2019s vibrant green eyes turned towards her and she watched as they filled with tears. \u201cLike, oh my God!,,\u201d Melony sobbed, \u201cI\u2019m totally a dude now!\u201d Everyone turned to look at one another- it was real. After a few more minutes of intense sobbing and a whole box of tissues later, Melony had finally regained some sense of composure and the group was eagerly questioning her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the hell did you do that?!,\u201d Scott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy the f*ck are you in my son\u2019s body?!\u201d Fiona snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does a male erection feel like?\u201d They all glared at Celine. \u201cWhat, so I\u2019m curious..,\u201d she shrugged embarrassed. Melony herself looked like she was on the verge of a mental breakdown. She didn\u2019t have answers for any of their questions and it felt like no answer could satisfy them. Eventually Carl put an end to their interrogations and pulled Melony over for a private chat. \u201cSorry for the sh*tshow,\u201d he said, \u201cBut everyone\u2019s just a bit, how do I say this?... <i>SCARED</i> right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey, like, should be! I\u2019m f*cking terrified and I\u2019m the one that just got swapped!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I can understand that. We just wanna know how it happened so we can make sure there\u2019re no more surprise exchanges that\u2019ll happen without our knowing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s totally just it- I have <i>NO IDEA</i> how it happened. I was literally, like, sitting down by the fountain, counting all my pageant awards in my head like I normally do when I get, like, totally stressed out about stuff. Then I suddenly, like, heard this voice in my head that said I was, like, chosen for a swap or whatever. Five seconds later and I\u2019ve got this f*cking orangutan goth body that smells like sweat, and onions, and mouldy sweatpants, and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I get the general idea,\u201d Carl groaned. He led a sulking Melony back to the group and explained their conversation. \u201cSo the swaps are activated by a simple selection system,\u201d Bianca mumbled to herself as all the remaining players sized each other up. Each looked at the others hesitantly, none daring to make the first selection and triggering a trading frenzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, what comes next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A dramatic silence settled over the inhabitants of the near deserted mall. A plastic bag rustled as the eerie breeze made its way through. All eyes fluttered between Melony\u2019s sulking teenage form and themselves. No-one wanted to be on the end of a disadvantageous swap but no-one wanted to make the first move. Tyler clutched his wife\u2019s hand for support. Fiona had pulled a cigarette from her bra and was lighting it tentatively. Timid Celine stood to the side whilst Bianca adjusted her glasses and sized up her options. The others were in a similar state but none dared to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun this time assumed the leadership role again and beckoned for Fiona to pass over the pack of smokes. She begrudgingly obliged and they all watched as Carl took a pair of pliers from his tool belt and snipped the ends off of some of the cigs to make them all different lengths. \u201cHell you doing with my fags?,\u201d Fiona whined as she puffed out a ring of smoke. Shaun gathered the cigarettes in both of his hairy paws, cradling them in a way that each tip was at the same height and the bottoms were indiscernible. He cracked a wry smile. \u201cAnyone up for a game of straws?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA collective groan rolled around the group. \u201cWhat,\u201d Shaun protested, \u201cAin\u2019t this the fairest way to choose who gets who? Easy logic here, longest cigarette gets first pick, next longest gets second, and so on and so on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose my body on just a game of random chance!,\u201d Brad yelled, \u201cDo you know how long it took me to reach peak physical conditions?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat other way do you propose, lunkhead?,\u201d Bianca snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a point, <i>senor.</i> Statistically speaking, the ten of us left all have equal probabilities to be able to choose new bodies first from the options given to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!,\u201d Melony squeaked. Her preppy outfit seemed horribly out of place on her gangly body and the heavy mascara she\u2019d applied in the mall boutique hire before had run all along her acne-ridden features. \u201cLike, what about me? I should, like, totally get another chance to pick another body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl ran down the rigid escalator at just that moment and said, \u201cSorry miss, but you\u2019ve already gotten your exchange, for better or worse. Hate to say it but you\u2019re stuck in that kid\u2019s body until we\u2019ve all changed and found a way to get everything back to normal.\u201d Melony crossed her arms childishly and began to sulk again. Fiona saw Carl come down and made her way over, asking, \u201cDid you find him? My son, any sign of where he is?\u201d Carl hung his head low as he produced the boy\u2019s t-shirt and jeans from behind his back. Tears welled up in Fiona\u2019s eyes. Carl brought the woman close to his chest, cradling her weeping head in his shoulder. \u201cThere, there, we\u2019ll find him, don\u2019t worry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-that bastard demon,\u201d Fiona sobbed and spat at the same time. Carl had been thinking and said to her, \u201cWhatever that thing was, it said something about \u2018hide-and-seek\u2019. Maybe once your son initiated the swap he was taken somewhere to \u2018hide\u2019? Whatever, what I\u2019m trying to say is I promise you we\u2019ll find him.\u201d Carl escorted Fiona back to the circle where Shaun had found himself a position in the centre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked around slowly, offering a cigarette one by one to everyone standing there. There was a curse from someone as they realised their cig had been completely sliced down the middle. Once everyone (excluding Melony of course) had received one, Shaun took the last for himself. \u201cOk,\u201d he said, \u201cEveryone, open your hands on three. One, two... Three!\u201d Shaun, Scott, Carl, Bianca, Marie, Fiona, Brad, Debby, Tyler and Celine all opened their hands and exposed their metaphorical straws to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who drew the longest straw?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Debby Lynch convinced herself that all the stress she had been under lately was causing her to hallucinate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the corner of the room, Shaun Lincoln picked up one of his tools that he'd been using to repair a fountain drink dispenser before he could clock out. He didn't particularly enjoy spending his evenings doing work for his crappy job but it was a good excuse to keep him from going home and dealing with his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about what the mysterious robed figure had said as he unbolted the back of the machine to get a look at what was wrong. Glancing over towards the others, they all still seemed disturbed but tried to continue on as if nothing happened. Debby's husband, Tyler was holding her bags and looked like he was about to depart with her as soon as she finished locking up her salon. Carl already walked off to resume his hourly rounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun already knew this machine was going to be a pain in the ass to fix. It had soda seeping out of the back of the machine onto the floor. Once he pulled the back panel off, he muttered \"Son of a bitch\" as he confirmed his suspicions. The people who owned the place were cheap and used the cheapest parts on all of their machines that constantly broke. It would take at least an hour to fix and clean this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over towards the other people still here, Shaun took interest in Brad. Unlike himself, Brad seemed to have everything Shaun wanted. He was tall, muscular, good looking and most importantly wasn't married to his obnoxious cow of a wife. Shaun thought back to what just happened a minute ago. There was no way it was real. He figured that his midlife crisis was making him see and hear things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad that crap wasn't real. If it was, I'd wish to be Brad in a heartbeat.\" Shaun muttered to himself as he reached into his tool bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut almost immediately after saying that, Shaun felt extremely warm and dizzy. The world felt like it was spinning faster and faster... until everything abruptly seemed to return back to normal. However, Shaun immediately noticed that he was now standing on the other side of the food court...</span></div></div>",

They were so bright that she had to look somewhat away in order to not be completely blinded. But once their brightness died out, he looked really confused. At first he looked down at his chest, then towards his hands and arms before looking over towards the broken soda machine that a repair guy was fixing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe repair guy briefly shrieked and freaked out before rushing over and attacking the good looking guy. \"Give me back my body!\" the portly repair guy demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeline couldn't believe what she was witnessing. She thought her mind was playing tricks on her when that robed man told her and everyone else that they had to pick a new body. It was so bizarre and random that it couldn't be real. People couldn't switch bodies. But it was no coincidence that not even a minute later she witnessed a man's eyes glow as if he was the Prophet followed by a scuffle and talks of stealing bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother good looking man with golden blonde hair dropped his pregnant partner's bag and rushed in to break up the fight. Celine thought that it was good timing. The older and out of shape repairman stood no chance against the muscular guy. A warm tingling sensation radiated from between her legs as she watched the muscular hunk's physique on full display. That was the kind of man she wanted but he father would never approve of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back and watching, Celine was genuinely curious to what was going on. Luckily, the security guard who just left ran back and helped split the two men apart. \"I want my body back now!\" the repair man screamed as he was pinned down. The muscular guy seemed pleased with himself and told him \"I did what I was told to do...\" before looking around over the rest of us \"...that creepy hooded guy said we had to pick new bodies or else. It's not my fault I grabbed the best one first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery started freaking out as a few of them that knew each other started whispering amongst themselves. A young black woman asked \"How did you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular guy smiled at her and said \"All I did was wish aloud that I was Brad. Everything began spinning and the next thing I knew, I was in his body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeline's jaw dropped. There was no way it was that simple. Body switching wasn't supposed to be real and if it was, it definitely wasn't supposed to be that easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wish I was myself again.\" the repairman said from on the floor. He waited a moment as nothing happened then said \"I wish I was Brad again and not Shaun!\" with a hint of desperation; but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the young black woman said aloud \"Well, I wish I was that young white guy over there.\" as she pointed towards a teenaged boy with reddish-brown hair that looked to be with his mother. Almost immediately like before, both of their eyes glowed brightly for several seconds before returning back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenaged boy immediately patted his chest and glossed over his hands as if he never seen them before with a pleased expression on his face. The boy\u2019s mother who was standing next to him took a step back and looked absolutely horrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the F*ck did you just do!?!\" the black woman shrieked from several feet away as she held out her hands and looked at them with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenaged boy laughed and said \"I'm simply moving on up in the world. Why should I struggle to get anywhere in life as a woman of color when I could easily become a white man and have everything handed to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?\" the homely looking redheaded woman asked the boy whom she thought was her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack huh? I guess that's my new name now as he patted his crotch. You must be \u201cMom\u201d. Your former son is over there.\" he said as his other hand pointed over towards the young black woman who was now cupping her breasts in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeline watched as other people began panicking and making a break for it after seeing what just happened. The young blonde man let Brad in Shaun's body go and hurried over towards his pregnant partner. People scattered as they ran towards the doors. Celine thought about what just happened. She needed to switch with someone too but someone else could take her body if she didn\u2019t act fast. Celine may not have been pleased with how her life has been thus far, but she knew that she would end being up worse off if she didn\u2019t pick someone fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking around, she quickly spotted the attractive blonde woman in capris that was with the group earlier. If she had to pick another body, she wanted one that she liked. But before she could wish to become her, Celine saw the woman stop running as her eyes began to glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it.\u201d She muttered as someone beat her to that body. She quickly looked around to see what choices were left when the older redheaded woman who refused to leave without whoever was in her son\u2019s body began to have glowing eyes too. It wasn\u2019t hard to figure out who switched with her since the scruffy looking guy with the beard was only a few feet away from her when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back towards the main doors, only 3 people were left: an old, frumpy looking Hispanic woman and the young couple. The Hispanic woman definitely wasn\u2019t an option and she wasn\u2019t interested in becoming a man; so that left her with only the pregnant woman left. Celine felt horrible at the thought of depriving the woman of the motherhood she was expecting and shackling her with Celine\u2019s overbearing father but it was the best choice left for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I was that pregnant woman\u2026\u201d Celine said aloud.

Tyler quickly caught his wife before she could fall over and was horrified as he saw her eyes glow. \u201cDebs! No!\u201d he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie tried to open one of the doors as Tyler cradled his disoriented wife on the floor as if he just watched her die in his arms. But as soon as Marie pulled on the doors, they emanated a blueish glow and refused to budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe doors aren\u2019t opening\u2026\u201d Marie cried out over her shoulder towards Tyler and his wife in desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler released the body of his pregnant wife as she started waking up and quickly turned around to see who she might be now. All of the other people in the mall with them seemed either busy examining themselves or horrified at what they found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler!\u201d he heard his name called out. He turned his head and saw an Arabic woman wearing a hijab, a baggy sweater and jeans running towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDebs?\u201d he asked as she approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby nodded and said \u201cI\u2019m here in this woman\u201d as she gestured towards her torso with her arms before coldly glaring down at the woman who stole her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeline woke up on the cold marble floor. The first thing she noticed was that her back ached and she felt as if she ate way too much. It was hard to sit up; especially when she noticed her bulging, beach ball sized belly protruding out. But right was she was about to climb back on her feet, she noticed her old body standing over her and looking quite pissed off too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me back my body you terrorist b*tch!\u201d she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeline hated being insulted for her heritage but she knew that many people often resorted to petty and racial insults when they are overwhelmed with emotions. As much as she wanted to defend herself, she had a good idea of how this woman felt as she rested one of her new hands on her pregnant belly. She just robbed this woman of her child even though she had no interest in carrying it in her stead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I took your body.\u201d Celine said in an unfamiliar voice as the blonde man joined her body at staring daggers at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to take your body or your child away from you but there weren\u2019t many people left to choose from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, all of the other people began making their way towards front doors. Some made their way over without a fuss while others like Melony who found herself in the body of the aged security guard, Carl was having a literal meltdown. Debby cried in her husband\u2019s shoulder as he held her while Carl in Melony\u2019s body took it upon himself to help Celine back on to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t the doors open?\u201d Marie ranted as she continued to pull on the doors. Every one she tried emitted a blueish glow when she pulled on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me try.\u201d Shaun said confidently as he grabbed the handle of one of the doors beside the one Marie was pulling on. But like before, it emitted a blueish glow every time he pulled on it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shaun continued to pull on the sealed door beside Marie to no avail, Bianca asked \u201cWe all swapped with someone right? That creepy guy said we all had to swap with somebody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott who was inspecting his freckled cleavage as he groped his large breasts beside Bianca said \u201cPretty sure we did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona rushed to him and slapped his hands down. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch my body like that you disgusting pervert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot all of us.\u201d Marie turned around towards the rest of the group as Shaun continued to futilely pull on the doors with all of his new found might. \u201cI\u2019m still myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what are you waiting for? Switch with whoever is left so we can all get out of here. I have a nice long bath I need to get to!\u201d Scott demanded as Fiona clenched her manly fists in anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca noticed that the blonde guy was holding the Arabic woman in his arms instead of his pregnant girl. \u201cThat blonde dude is the other one that didn\u2019t switch. Switch with him so we can all get out of here.\u201d She motioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby noticed that most of the people turned their gaze towards her Tyler. She got upset again with what was about to happen. It was bad enough that she ended up in this strange woman\u2019s body but at least she could still be with Tyler and start their family all over again\u2026 unless he ended up in that old woman\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Debby\u2019s turn to try and protect her husband as everyone surrounded both of them. \u201cNo! I already lost my baby. You\u2019re not taking my husband too.\u201d she shouted at the mob that surrounded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook lady, we all can\u2019t stay trapped here forever.\u201d Bianca said coldly as she crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI rather we all stayed here forever than let you run off with my life!\u201d Jack said angrily as he tried to cross his arms over his chest like Bianca did but his new breasts got in the way. Bianca giggled as she saw Jack\u2019s tough guy facade backfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie looked really sad as she spoke. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but we all have somewhere to be. I wouldn\u2019t do this if there was another way to get out of here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby tried to lunch towards the old Hispanic woman but Tyler held on to her. \u201cNoooo\u2026\u201d she screamed as she began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t make Marie feel any better. She didn\u2019t want to steal anyone\u2019s life \u2013let alone someone so much younger and full of potential but many others including herself depended on it. Marie hoped that Jesus Christ would forgive her for what she was about to do. \u201cI wish I was that young blonde guy\u2026\u201d she said regretfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately everyone watched as both the old woman and the blonde guy\u2019s eyes glowed brightly. Debby was was trying to lunge to the older woman felt her husband\u2019s grip on her release. She turned around and cried as she held onto him until his eyes returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler?\u201d Debby asked as tears ran down her unfamiliar face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Physically, Marie felt better than she ever did in the last 30 or 40 years but spiritually she felt awful. She just robbed a young man near the beginning of his life and left him in her body that\u2019s near its end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be okay honey\u2026\u201d Debby heard an aged female voice behind her. She turned around and saw the older Hispanic woman look extremely sad as she examined one of her weathered hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebby rushed over to her husband and embraced him. He sounded relatively calm but it was pretty obvious that he was really shaken up by being placed in the body of a woman that was almost old enough to be his grandmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was no other way... if we didn\u2019t switch, we would have been trapped here forever.\u201d he told her as she cried while embracing him in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is bullsh*t\u201d Shaun muttered as he continued to pull on the doors that still refused to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca \u201cLike what the f*ck? We all switched bodies. Why can\u2019t we leave?\u201d she said in an effeminate manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther people were equally just as confused. Celine stood in the corner cradling her belly as several people started getting at each other\u2019s throats when that weird hooded guy appeared out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed. I gave you all 24 hours to make your picks and you ended up doing it in a few of your minutes. Now the real games can begin.\u201d The mysterious hooded man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody immediately stopped fighting with each other when he spoke. However, Melony in Carl\u2019s body was extremely vocal. \u201cGames!?! You\u2019re a sick bastard.\u201d She told him as she aggressively balled her hands into fists like she was about to attack him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie in Tyler\u2019s body did the sign of the cross as she said \u201cBy the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, you shall be cast back to hell where you belong minion of Lucifer\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious figure laughed. \u201cMinion of Lucifer? I am beyond your silly superstitions and man made religions Marie Delores Lopez.\u201d He then looked over towards Melony as if he was aware of what she was about to do and continued \u201cand you Melony Anne Fields, former prom queen that never has and never will achieve anything else in life aside from spreading your legs\u2026\u201d His words seemed ominous and resonated with both women-turned-men. Melony\u2019s anger turned to fear as she backed away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that I have you all settled down, let me explain how this game will go. All of you will put your best efforts into being a better version of the people you\u2019ve all become. You all have one moon or one month as you mortals prefer to keep track of time with to be better people than the original inhabitants of those bodies. If anyone screws this up, I shall return and claim their souls to fuel another project of mine\u2026 which is far worse than your fictitious Hell that you fear my dear Marie. If you succeed, then I will leave you to enjoy the fruits of your new lives without my presence.\u201d The mysterious figure explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona didn\u2019t seemed pleased with these rules. \u201cBut I want my body back and my son want\u2019s his body back too!\u201d she told the hooded man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFiona\u2026 Fiona\u2026 your days as a single mother and manager of that movie theatre are over. You\u2019re now a 32 year old, socially inept virgin that works for minimum wage at the arcade down the hall from your old life. As for your son, he will now have to learn how to live as a dark skinned woman and cope with all the setbacks that it will bring him.\u201d he explained to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people were upset and others were pleased after hearing that they will keep their new bodies for good. The mysterious figure could sense it all. He did chuckle and said one more thing. \u201cOne more thing before I let you all go. I\u2019m feeling somewhat generous right now, so I\u2019ll change a couple things around.\u201d Before anybody could ask what that was, he extended both of his arms towards both Marie and Melony. He pulled their souls out of the bodies they currently inhabited and tossed them into each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie\u2019s senses returned as she felt numerous dull aches throughout her body and a lack of energy that she had moments ago. Looking down, she saw that she was wearing the dark blue uniform and had the aged, masculine hands that belonged to the security guard. Across from her, was the young blonde man looking just as surprised as she was. \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked in a deeper baritone voice than she had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hooded figure chuckled again. \u201cWhy? Because I felt like improving both of your odds since both of you ladies were the only ones with the literal and figurative balls to try and challenge me. I\u2019ll tell you what Marie. If Tyler successfully finishes my game, I\u2019ll ensure your father makes a miraculous recovery and allow you to have many years left with him. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re smart enough to find a way to work him into your new life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hooded figure turned around and began to walk away deeper into the mall, Debby called out to him. \u201cWhat about me and my family?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stopped and briefly looked over his shoulder towards her and said \u201cWhat about you Debby? You\u2019re now a single, yet unremarkable Arabic woman and your new family is extremely religious. You can either avoid crossing your new father or find a man worthy of his approval to escape his grasp. Tyler is no longer your husband and your unborn child now has new parents to care for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hooded man continued walking away and seemingly faded away as if he were a mirage. As soon as he disappeared, all the doors at the front of the mall glowed brightly one more time before fading back to normal. Shaun cautiously pulled on one of the doors and to his surprise, it opened without any resistance. He quickly stepped outside, followed by all the others. The storm was completely gone as if it never happened and the sun in the clear sky was setting.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>Background</b>: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have been on a body swapping high recently, it started a few months ago when I finished reading the book Where I End and You Begin. I the watched Status Change by Three Degrees of Center Productions as well as the Quarantine Leap series. I've been adding a lot to \"<a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interactive-story/item_id/1847278-New-Body-Switching-Machine\" title=\"You've built a body switching machine, and now it's time for a test run.\" target=\"_top\">New Body Switching Machine</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"You've built a body switching machine, and now it's time for a test run.\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interactive-story/item_id/1847278-New-Body-Switching-Machine\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> and when I was active a few months ago I did a whole brain swapping path for \"<a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interactive-story/item_id/1575512-The-Guillotine\" title=\"When a family discovers a guillotine with magic powers, strange things happen.\" target=\"_top\">The Guillotine</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"When a family discovers a guillotine with magic powers, strange things happen.\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interactive-story/item_id/1575512-The-Guillotine\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>. I had also recently finished reading Crosswinds, which had an interesting character in it that gave the main characters an interesting threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have decided to make my own interactive story involving body swapping, mostly because I would like more control over it. To be able to go back and edit what I don't like and set the ages of the characters to be at least 18. There's some great stories out there but I'm not comfortable having a 16 year old swap into the body of a twenty year old and especially not a 10 year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Idea</b>: <br>\r\nWhen I write swap stories I want to try to be somewhat realistic, people will explore the bodies they find them selves in, I'm not fond of that when it's a family member and so it's dealing with being in the body of someone you might not want to see naked. I'm also all for chaos, if things can get out of hand or swaps are made to be permanent I'm fine with that. I also have no problems ending a story if it meets its narrative conclusion, such as dying or being trapped as an animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am very much for male to female swaps and as a result female to male. I am fine with people losing their age by swapping with someone a generation or two older than them. I've actually had dreams where I've swapped bodies with my female cousin. Animal swaps are perfectly okay too, though without being taught they might not know how to be human. Have a man swap with someone who's pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese swaps can be done via magic, technology or super powers. Tiny remotes or giant machines are all fine, even a brain transplant. Curses too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Issues and Structure</b><br>\r\nWhen I come onto Writing.com it becomes an obsession. It got so bad I've gone through two different profiles. There also doesn't seem to be as many people around as there used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have two other stories that no one has added to and I think that's because of how I did up the description, though I mostly write for myself anyway. My ideas can get away from me and I might write things I'm not usually into or go deep down a rabbit hole so I do want to reserve the right to delete or alter paths. This can be a put off for some of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know not everyone is the best at writing or English is a native language but I also want to open this for all. I'm not the best at writing either. If I find an idea to be good but hard to understand I would like to fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing on this site I'd like to address is how some chapters people add go way off from the original suggestion or put you into a position where the path doesn't really allow to act or throws a curve ball that someone might not like. This is why 90% of the time I will put in the Something else option, the other 10% is when there's only two or three possible choices, like picking your gender. The Something else is there to allow someone to pick an option someone might've not thought of, or it could be used to change the previous chapter, going back to the choice that lead to that section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy final issue I struggle with when it comes to interactives is going for a broad or narrow ideas. A narrow idea might be to set the story up in a University where someone has made a machine to allow for body swapping with set characters such as Jane Doe the 21 year old blonde cheerleader and Blake Jones the nerdy 20 year old. This gives a focus to the story but rules out so many potential threads. Going to broad might leave no direction but allow for endless possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this interactive I am going to try for both approaches. The first options will be listed as Story # until a title can be developed, even if it's something simple as Swap Remote. Under each story the first path should be set up to be the premise and include a cast of characters. If don't like how the Swap Remote gets started, make a Swap Remote 2 with one of the other options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExample:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Magic Mirror:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda and James are best friends on their last year of high school, they enter a magic shop where they find this strange mirror, able to swap bodies:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCast:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda: Age 18. (enter description and traits.)<br>\r\nJames: Age 18.<br>\r\nBrenda's Mum: Age 39<br>\r\nBrenda's sister: Age 22<br>\r\nJames's Dog: Age 2, German Shepard</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Final Thoughts:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this is the front page and I would like the story set out to offer the most ideas possible, I decided to turn this into an area to describe what I want out of this interactive instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do hope people add to it, though I will continue writing, even if I only get 10 views. I will try to keep an eye on the story and edit when able.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope you enjoy reading and I hope you make additions.</td>",
