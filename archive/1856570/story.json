            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>1) Thulka Thudcrush, ogress barbarian - Standing seven and a half feet tall, with muscles that would make a very muscular thing feel not very muscular at all and a jaw that could bite through rocks (not that she'd eat rocks -- unless they happened to be those colorful rocks that anyone could mistake for fruit, honest mistake), Thulka is a terrifying sight.   She's also quite beautiful, in a harsh, windswept sort of way, with skin like yellowed ivory, full, dark lips, and lustrous -- if crudely cut -- hair.   Of course to really see these things, you'd have to get close to her, which means getting in range of her mighty mace, Head-Smasherizer, so most people are content to admire quietly, from a distance, through a telescope if possible.    Thulka typically wears a fur tunic and loincloth and very little else, the better to show off her amazing abs and smokin' biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Eilowyn Honeyridge, dwarven paladin - Almost as imposing as Thulka, and at only four feet, too -- but a pure and disciplined heart beats beneath her impressively large breastplate.   Typically dressed in full plate draped with the tabard of the goddess Eola, she removes her helmet indoors, allowing her golden braids to hang almost to the floor.   Courteous and kind, she nevertheless will not tolerate evil.  Or yanking on her braids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Snip Windfingers, halfling rogue - Slight of build, with tanned, freckled skin and curly auburn hair, this halfling lass prides herself on her ability to work through any lock or trap and get into any vault, no matter how tightly guarded.  She's greedy in the extreme, and will do just about anything if the price is right.   Usually wears black leather when she's \"working\", but she's just as often found in a simple peasant dress -- you don't want to walk around all day in clothes which say I AM A THIEF, after all, especially when the local lord is starting to wonder just where his spare ivory backscratcher has gotten to.   She always has at least six knives hidden on her at all times, though.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Morissa Thorne, vampire elf necromancer - Just about pure evil, when Morissa's not guzzling blood from the local peasants, she's plotting how to lure more peasants to the area to replenish her stock.  Her stark white skin stands out almost luminously against the blackness of her hair, her eyes, and her slinky black robes.   Her weapon of choice is the Wand of Compulsion, which can force just about anybody to do just about anything.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Mifflemix Mistweeze Zipple, pixie mage - Only a foot high but bursting with magic, Miffle does her best to master the art of the arcane, but unfortunately she's got more enthusiasm than control -- or sense.   She has light blue hair and antennae, as well as dragonfly wings, and is usually dressed in something made of leaves.  Like all pixies, she has a massive sweet tooth.</span></div></div>",

Behind her was a path of pillage and destruction a hundred miles long.  She turned her head and looked down the mountain at the burning fires.  It had been a profitable week, and her packs and saddlebags bulged with treasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled tightly.  She had eaten only light meals while on her rampage, preferring to stay quick on her feet, and now it was catching up to her -- although she could go for quite a while without food when she had to, she needed an absolutely enormous meal when the time came.   She surveyed her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the hill she could see the tiled roofs of a quaint little human hamlet through the trees.   Humans could be iffy -- they didn't tend to like ogres -- but they could always be counted on to have food on hand, and be willing to part with it in exchange for money.  And she had LOTS of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, the road winding off to the right bore the telltale signs of goblin passage.  Goblins were less likely to have much to eat on hand, but they were easy to bully, and she could always roast a few of <i>them</i> up in a pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she could just make camp here and have Enormerous for dinner.  It wasn't like she'd never done it before.  Technically, he was Enormerous the Fifth.  And that <i>was</i> the fastest way to get something into her belly, which was loudly demanding meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It reeked of that human softness that made them the laughingstock of the ogres. What, exactly, was wrong with a town like Gnashbite? Nothing, in Thulka's opinion, far better than Vale Parish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she made her way towards the nearest inn, barging through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome humans started, an elf scowled, and an orc grunted a greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA busty tavern wench appeared before Thulka, bowing. \"Would the lady like a table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, I would, and bring me your most filling meal along with two mugs of ale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the wench soon had Thulka seated, the mugs coming fast. \"Your meal will be our pot pie, made with the meats from sows, cows, and sheep all deep fried and wrapped in a thick crust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" Thulka said, finishing her first mug in one mighty swig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching mightily, Thulka downed the second just as swiftly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More ale, wench!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nodded, her blue eyes gleaming as she noticed a slight rounding of the orc's impressive muscles from the swift influx of calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, she grabbed five mugs, each one bigger than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Thulka finished them, she was only lightly buzzed, her pot pie coming shortly afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging her fingers in, she ate like a rabid wolf, hardly stopping to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wench watched all of this with her eyes gleaming and couldn't help but reach out a hand to rub that stuffed middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka soon had the human's hand in her own and glared at the wench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I am sorry madame, it's just you're appetite is...appealing to me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka observed the wench, noting her wide hips and big breasts, grunting in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do for a quick lay. Give me a room and join me and I shall show you how much we ogres can really devour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wench nodded, blushing as she felt Thulka's hand swat her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Jalinda, madame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Thulka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral gasps went out at that and Thulka chortled. \"I see you have heard of me. But enough talk. Procure me that room and more food this instant, human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalinda nodded and scurried to fulfill the famous ogre's command.</span></div></div>",

That's why we always rut on a full stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating makes you...\" Jalinda blushed, \"<i>f-frisky?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka just snapped her teeth at her playfully, causing Jalinda to back up a little.  \"I-I see.  Well, I'll just have to see what I can do to help things along, won't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wheeled a cart into the room laden with salty, savory-smelling inn food.   Thulka practically salivated at the aroma of the vintage twice-congealed gravy, and the sizzling fat dripping from roast haunch of some-beast-or-other.  Teasingly, Jalinda held the hunk of meat over her, lowering it to the barbarian's slavering mouth, and she ripped into it with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.  How are we feeling?\" Jalinda asked after haunch had been gnawed down to the bone, the mountain of gravy-soaked biscuits had been devoured, and an entire jug of the inn's finest rotgut had been poured down Thulka's throat.  In response, the ogre woman thumped her chest and let loose with a thunderous belch.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Temptress wench,\" she half-muttered, half-moaned.  \"If my loins grow any hotter, I will snap your scrawny body into pieces when we proceed to the main course.  Dispense with these appetizers, and get into this bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalinda shook her head.  \"But I have the main course right here, madame.   You should have asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled a cloth off of the top of the cart, revealing a whole second layer even more loaded down with food.  Thulka's eyes widened.  In truth, though she hadn't been lying -- she was<i> roasting</i> with lust -- an ogress was not a bottomless pit, and after having a feast worthy of an ogre king hand-fed to her, she was glutted well past the point of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tire of food,\" Thulka growled.  \"Pleasure me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In good time,\" Jalinda said.  \"All in good time.  I want you at your very best before we get to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began unrolling a thick spool of sausages, dangling the end of the string in front of Thulka's face, and guided the first tube of spicy meat into her unresisting mouth.   Ogres were creatures of habit, and if you put food near their mouths, they would usually eat it, even if stuffed to the gills.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalinda unspooled the links faster, feeding them into Thulka's mouth with one hand and rubbing her throat with the other.   The ogress scarcely dared moved for fear she would choke.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the sausages stopped.  \"Enough!\" Thulka roared.  \"No more!\"   She attempted to sit up, intent on dragging this troublesome tart down into the bed and giving her a taste of her own medicine, but a queasy jolt of pain stopped her.  Her stomach was so distended that she couldn't even bend at the waist -- and she was drunk.  Really drunk.  The room was spinning around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little more,\" Jalinda squealed in ecstasy.  \"You're just about done!\"  She uncorked a bottle of wine and shoved it roughly into Thulka's mouth.   Thulka felt shudders of nausea twisting her insides as the contents of the bottle joined over a gallon of assorted ales and more food than she even wanted to<i> think</i> about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-ugh--uggle!\" Thulka choked on the foamy liquid.  Then the combined forces of drunkenness and severe overindulgence collapsed on her, and she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, a still very bloated -- and still <i>annoyingly</i> horny -- Thulka awoke to find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The room was packed full of soldiers, all with swords and halberds pointed at her. These guys didn't look like they were just town guard. Their armor was a cut above the rest, and their leader seemed to just positively drip with the kind of full-of-himself authority Thulka loved to watch vanish from people's faces, shortly before she made their faces vanish with her hammer. Determined to go down fighting despite her nudity, she tried to leap from the bed only to find that two things were keeping her. Her hands and legs were shackled together and fastened to the bed, and her gut was still bloated and swollen from the sheer amount of food that strumpet shoveled into her yesterday. And she could see her now, with a nice, fat bag of gold, leaving the room hurriedly. The lead soldier opened up a parchment, cleared his throat, and began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thulka Thudcrush, alias Thulka the Thunderous, alias Thulk Smash, alias The Thulkster, The Tavern Terror, alias the Whorenihillator, alias Ol' Dirty Bitch. You have committed crimes against the kingdom, including but not limited to murder, rape, theft, blasphemy, arson, destruction of property both private and public, poaching, public indecency, tax evasion, and tethering an animal in an illegal spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those charges are trumped up! I've never illegally parked Enormerous in my life! Come closer, so I can crush your skull between my thighs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain ignored her and continued on. \"For these crimes, you have been sentenced to death. However, the Baron of these lands has pleaded for lenience in your case. In exchange for your freedom, you are to perform a task for him. You are to slay a giant clan that has taken up residence near his castle, and rescue his daughter. Fifty percent of loot and pillage found in this venture is yours, but you will be accompanied by a kingdom-appointed wizard and have... Safeguards put on you, to make sure you don't get any funny ideas about running away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, a rather scrawny young man in a pointed hat and tattered robes shuffled sheepishly out of the thicket of blades, clutching a spellbook for dear life. He looked at the ogress nervously at first, and then a little bit appreciatively after he realized she was naked. Thulka roared at him, thrashing her chains angrily, making the bed creak and splinter a bit with her rage. Backing up with a yelp, the wizard retreated only to find himself being guided back to the ogress with a sword at his back. \"And don't think the Baron's forgotten about what YOU'VE done, Abernathy. Get casting. The sooner this farce is done with, the better.\" The barbarian couldn't help but chuckle as the wizard grumbled, timidly approaching her with his wand pulled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not going to be big enough.\" She mocked him with a kissy face, causing him to blush bright red. The wand traced a sigil of putrescent green around her navel, and the mage finished off by tapping seven times on her drum taut stomach, eliciting a loud belch from Thulka. \"Fames Gastros!\" He then went to the shackles, enchanting them somehow. \"Catenas Placis!\" Thulka snorted. To put things succinctly, she wasn't much a fan of magic. Fancy words and hand waving... Ridiculous! But also dangerous. What did this runt just do to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they began to undo her shackles. Well, they began to undo the chains of her shackles, anyway, leaving the wrist and leg bindings on. A foolish mistake on their part. Even stodged full of food and booze, she was still a force to be reckoned with. Springing off of the bed with a leap, she moved to bring her fist smashing into the wizard's face, eliciting the most pleasantly girlish scream from him... When suddenly, mere inches from knocking his teeth in, her fist stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the hunger hit. She groaned in pain as her stomach seemed to clench with hunger despite being nearly full. Her arms went to her belly, trying to massage the pain away, but it had no real effect. Then she saw the wizard timidly touch her stomach, and the pain seemed to go away... Though the hunger was still there. Diminished, but there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you DO to me, shrimp?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbernathy mumbled and stuttered a bit before the captain stepped in. \"Merely something to keep you... Reined in. The shackles have been enchanted to keep you from doing violence to anyone, unless directed to by a representative of the Baron or the lad here. The mark's something to keep you from running away. Unless Abernathy touches his wand to your stomach once every day in the morning, or if you try to hurt anyone besides those you're SUPPOSED to, it'll trigger. I believe you already know what it does. Even if you manage to evade patrols while rubbing your poor widdle tummy, good luck trying to forage enough food to keep yourself from going mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers filed out of the room, and as the captain reached the door, he turned around for a moment and threw a rolled-up parchment at the bed. \"Details about your mission are on there. Oh. And don't think the wizard will help you escape. He has his own reasons for complying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, it was just Thulka and Abernathy. Shuffling a bit, the magic user looked down. \"Um. Sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and turn around so I can get dressed.\"</span></div></div>",

Quite warm, really--must be a lot of geothermic activity here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a rumble from beneath them, and the hill shifted.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear, perhaps a bit too much!\" Abernathy said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Thulka said.  She pulled out her mace and swung it into the rocky ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh!\"  A tortured groan booomed all around them.  \"Whooo did that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes opened in the rocky cliff across from them.  Lips parted in another low moan of pain.  What Thulka had suspected had been confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we found the giants,\" she said.   Indeed, the landscape shifted further around them, until it was quite clear that they were standing on the bulging gut of a very large, and very fat, stone giantess who was reclining in the length of a rocky canyon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get...off...\" the stone woman growled.  \"Get off my belly, before I<i> smash </i>you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and stay still if you know what's good for you, you overfed molehill,\" Thulka barked.  \"We want to know where you're holding the princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where I...?\"  The giantess chuckled, a sound like a small avalanche while tapered off into a groan.  \"Ha!  You think I care about that wench?   My...my stupid ex-boyfriend, the shaman-king...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused to belch enormously, releasing a swarm of thousands of bats and blowing several clouds aside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...he... he tossed me out in favor of that scrawny trollop!  Said he was tired of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, perhaps there's a non-violent resolution here!\" Abernathy said brightly.  \"If you were to lose a few...tons... perhaps his interest would be rekindled, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess laughed sharply.  \"Ha!  He's the one who did this to me.  Likes 'em big, he said!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my.  He certainly does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when we captured a cornucopia on a raid to the far westlands, the rotten two-timer talked me into swallowing it!  Didn't bother to get it out again after he dumped me, of course, no, not King Lazy-Ass, oh no!  So now it's down there in my guts, still pouring out bread and grapes and god knows what, and I'm lying here with a butt the size of a continent while he frolics with that little thimbleful of slut soda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rested assured we intend to rescue that, er, thimbleful from your ex,\" Abernathy said.   \"Perhaps you'd be so kind as to lead us to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too..full... to move...\" the giantess grunted.   \"And too fat to squeeze out of this canyon anymore, anyway.

So I'm bigger-boned...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and fatter too.\"  Thulka grinned.  \"Looks like it makes you more of what you already are.  Muscular humans get more muscular, while cream puffs get creamier, and puffier.   I'm not complaining, mind.  I like my wenches with a little meat on 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just wait,<i> my love</i>,\" Jalinda murmured, running her hand across Thulka's rock-hard abdominal muscles.   \"I like <i>my</i> wenches with a <i>lot</i> of meat on them.\"  Her fingers squeezed together, attempting to pinch an inch that wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-ho!

Removing a cloak from the pony trailing behind them, Thulka slipped the piece of clothing over Jalinda's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't be cold,\" Thulka said to Jalinda's questioning eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, the ogress felt a rush of gratitude and contentment at the look and sound of thanks from her mate, swiftly shaking her head. No, she can't be developing simpering sentimentality now! That was for humans not for an ogre like her. But maybe, maybe there was more to the Bond of Kings than just binding Jalinda to her and changing her mate's figure and partly her species. Jalinda's stomach rumbled then and she let out an ogreish grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalinda smirked.

My friend here would like another platter of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friend said she's done,\" Thulka growled.  \"Anything else you get, <i>you're</i> eating.\"   Already, they were getting even more stares from the soldiers and assembled civilian workers than before; she dreaded standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're no fun,\" Jalinda pouted.  \"I thought you ogres -- we ogres -- were <i>always</i> up to a challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka grinned, displaying her massive canines.  \"As a matter of fact, I <i>do</i> have a challenge in mind.

An entire bathtub full of beer?\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even harder,\" Thulka said with a wide.  \"Finding a suit of armor that will fit those fat hams of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the fort occasionally hired mercenaries for extra muscle, and the armorer had previously done some work for ogres, trolls, and the odd minotaur or two.  He had several breastplates suitable for an extra-large wearer stored in the back of the shop, and after a bit of a struggle with the straps (Jalinda had obviously never worn armor in her life) the two of them managed to get her in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalinda looked herself over in the mirror, a look of dismay on her face.  \"Oh, not <i>this!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like I'm wearing a tin can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka raised an eyebrow.   \"Do you know what 'armor' is, honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-- but it's not sexy at all!

Fitted armor!   You want fitted armor, with the amount you eat?  We'd have to buy a new set every week!   Don't you know how <i>expensive</i> armor is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no... is it a lot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's plenty, trust me.\"   Thulka sighed, seeing how disappointed Jalinda looked.   \"FINE.  I guess you'll probably burn a little of that off adventuring anyway.  Speaking of which, after this armor and our recent food bills, we're going to need to find something pretty quick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka read over the jobs boards in front of the commissary, looking for the telltale black skull mark that indicated risk to life and limb (and better pay).  The pickings were slim; a fort filled with soldiers was more in need of maids and horse-brushers than monster slayers.  Still, she found a couple of prospects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just love my new armor,\" Jalinda said, admiring herself.  \"Thank you again, honey!\"   She gave Thulka a peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't see how you're comfortable in something that's basically a stainless steel corset,\" Thulka grumbled, embarrassed.  \"And what if someone shoots an arrow at your chest?   Your tits are plumped out there like two turkeys in a serving tureen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admit it, you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd just better not fatten out of it too quickly.   We haven't got enough money left over to buy you a potato sack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalinda placed a hand on Thulka's stomach, which still bulged slightly from her commissary feast.  \"You're the one I want to fatten up, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you forget the part where I said my purse was empty?

Aren't they undead bones reanimated by dark magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, but a stout blow will undo the bond that knits their moldy bones together. Though in your case I suppose your arse would crush them easier than a blow from my axe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalinda whacked Thulka on the head and that and Thulka grinned. She had definitely chosen well for a mate, Jalinda not afraid at all of striking back when teased. \"Well with how big you're going to get off of our pay for this mission, you'll be squashing them with a big arse of your own, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough banter, let's find the captain of this squad and go about our business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalinda nodded and followed after her mate, sticking a little closer than usual after noticing the glares and stares heading her way, Thulka's arm wrapping around her side and keeping her there as they wandered towards the directions indicated on the poster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                                    ///<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You I'll take, but the fat one will have to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka shook her head. \"We are bonded. Where I go, she goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain sighed at that, knowing he didn't have any other option. He needed all the aid he could get and an ogress warrior would be quite the aid indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Thulka, Jalinda, and a party of twelve other volunteers made their way from the garrison to a cave infested with wights. It was the closest staging ground for attacks on the hold. Jalinda held her broadsword as Thulka had taught her, a part of her more than a little frightened of the darkness all around but another, wilder part of her was looking forward to the coming combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMust be the ogre in me, Jalinda thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just after she thought this, the wights pounced. Wailing, lip-less maws opening wide, they screamed and struck with inhuman strength. Already one of the volunteers had fallen but another, an elven mage, soon cast a fire spell, enchanting the weapons of the surviving members with flame. Striking as hard as she could, Jalinda felt the strength of the blow as it caved in a wight's chest. She was so ecstatic that she didn't see a bony hand rushing towards her exposed side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Thulka's weapon blocked the fatal blow and a riposte ended the foe. More wights came but by this time the momentum had shifted and the party ventured further until, less than an hour later, the entirety of the cave had been explored. The last of the wights lay at the captain's feet and the group cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the hold, the captain doled out the promised gold, Jalinda's eyes widening as she took in just how much it was. The bag was nearly as full as her stomach had been when she was last in the hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her share, she looked at Thulka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the bag and handing her mate half, she winked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest will be going towards your dinner tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka nodded at that, following after her mate and enjoying the sight of Jalinda's quivering rear as it jiggled to and fro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Moving towards Jalinda, who was struggling to set up her side of the single tent they had brought, Thulka took the burden she was wrestling with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't overdo things, I don't want to see you hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalinda smiled widely at that and turned such a loving gaze to Thulka that it made the ogress sick. \"I only mean that it would be unseemly of an ogress to have her mate be injured. It makes me look weak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalinda just smirked and patted Thulka on her stomach, a stomach that was a tad softer than usual owing to the feeding sessions the pair had been through. \"Whatever you say, Thulka dearest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing as an ogre was wont to do, which meant her cheeks were now darker than before, Thulka spied Glinda watching the pair and scribbling something down in a large scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see how that exchange could possibly be of any value to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not everyday that one finds an ogress willingly admitting to not liking the sight of someone hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you make me some ham?

Still, that didn't stop her from rolling her eyes at the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good if one is used to slop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlinda rolled her own eyes at the insult, watching Thulka grab several large slices afterwards while Jalinda flopped on her back, bloated and content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no more pig for awhile,\" Jalinda murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka smirked at the sight of her gluttonous mate and moved a bit closer, a hand groping Jalinda's mighty rear end, squeezing a bountiful amount of the fat found there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it falls to me to eat the rest of this then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalinda nodded and shoved the rest of the pig towards Thulka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up and then join me in the tent for some more fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka grunted at that and began to pick up her pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We should go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, now.   Where there's thieves, there must be money, as sure as a cloud of flies means something filthy underneath.

It hadn't grown large enough to match Thulka and Jalinda's jiggly, hulking, spherical guts, but it was enough to lift her blood stained shirt, exposing her dainty navel. Her breasts had gained some modest volume, as did her hips, thighs and rear, which collectively threatened to break out of their confining tanned leather prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka was deeply shaken up by what had happened. She had been left nearly winded by a fight with a few thugs, and would almost certainly have been able to save Glinda in time in her slimmer days. Thulka laid a hand on her belly. Getting fat really was slowing her down. What would happen if it were Jalinda in such a situation. Now beginning to seriously worry about her mate, Thulka, for the first time in her life, seriously considered retiring. Briefly, Thulka mulled over what life would be like after she had hung up her hammer for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her travels, she'd accumulated a reasonably impressive stash of gold, maybe she'd put it towards a little cottage, somewhere out in the woods for the two of them.

It wasn't until the sun was starting to rise did the two of them felt both of their appetites were truly satisfying. So with their bellies extended and their groins covered in bodily fluids, the two laid fell asleep in each others arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until midday did Thulka finally awake to find herself in a soft bed, well rested and a beautiful human female in her arms. Much of her still ached from the weeks of travel and from the amount of food and wild sex she last night, but by the Goddesses was it worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down on the image of heavenly beauty that lay sleeping on top of her, with her breasts being used as pillows. But as much as she hated to admit it, Thulka felt that Jalinda probably needed to awake for work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wench,\" Thulka said in a soft tone, \"don't you need to get up for work or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have three answers for that question.\" Came the reply from the now obvisily not a sleep bar maiden despite not opening her eyes. \"First, the Stuffed Pig is my tavern, so I decided to give myself the day off. Second, I've been awake for nearly an hour, so it's you who need to awaken earlier. Thirdly if you call me wench one more time, I'll stab you with a blunted butter knife. I know you love these sex games and it may have been fun last night but play time is over, for now you can call me Jalinda, wife, sweaty, beautiful, or even \"My Goddess\" when were alone and nothing else.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about your 'majesty' or 'my Queen'?\" Asked Thulka who found her human wife making death threats against absolutely hysterical and erotic.         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, but only if you found the \"Seed of the Galati.\" The Seed that Jalinda was referring to was a legendary gem created by the goddess Galati to impregnate her wife Halin and according to legend it would allow any woman to impregnate any other woman of any race. It was the reason that Thulka had marched out and spent three weeks on the saddle and exploring forgotten monster-infested ruins. Both she and Jalinda wanted children and the Seed of Galati was the only way to have them, so off went the ogress barbarian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did.\" Thulka responded which in turn was answered by glee full squeal by an excited and fully awake Jalinda. \"But I will only pull it out if you tell me why you didn't ask me about in the first place? You're usually business first and games second, why the sudden change?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen you in a month, the last thing I wanted was to waste time figuring out how to use the dammed thing. All I wanted was to feed you and then fuck you until you had trouble walking the next morning. Also I figured that whether or not you found the Seed you still deserved an award for trying.  I know how much you love playing 'wild barbarian adventure sweeps village girl off her feet and into the bed room'.\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that does make sense.

Before their first night together, Jalinda had owned a very expensive set of crockery, a family heirloom.   After two hours of the bed slamming against the floor, they'd come downstairs, seeking water for their dehydrated bodies, and found it reduced to dust.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like this,\" Thulka explained.  She pulled her satchel out from under the bed and withdrew the Seed.  It was a massive emerald, half of it left in the original blocky, dark state in which it had been ripped from the earth, the other cut into the image of two women intertwined in a passionate embrace, their bellies round with life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalinda's eyes widened.  \"It's gorgeous!  It looks fine with me.  Why can't we use it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, go ahead and use it,\" Thulka said, gesturing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalinda picked up the heavy lump of crystal.  She turned it this way and that.  She moved it towards Thulka, then pulled it back towards herself.  She stopped and thought for long seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, I'm not sure... what I'm actually supposed to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you see the problem,\" Thulka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you went all this way to get it and you forgot to find out how to use it?\" Jalinda said hotly.  \"Dearest, I love you, but sometimes I think your head is as stuffed full of muscles as the rest of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, excuse me!\" Thulka snapped.  \"Their wasn't an instruction scroll, and the skeletal hydra that was guarding it didn't <i>happen</i> to be in an talkative mood!    Maybe you could go back to the tomb, walk through a swarm of zombie rats up to your waist, and ask them <i>yourself!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women glared at each other for a moment, and finally Jalinda sighed.

This meant tending to the Stuffed Pig Tavern and its customers for Jalinda and giving the locals combat as well as being the bouncer for the Stuffed Pig in the evening for Thulka.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried everything they could think of to get the Seed working, using it as a sex toy, magic spells, holy chants, and none of it worked. Night after night they meet with failure to bring life into this world, and the stress of it was starting to show. To deal with the constant failure Jalinda had taken to cooking more as well as making it more fattening. This wasn't a problem for Thulka whose physical job, large size, and natural disposition to put on muscle easily just meant she just added a few pounds of muscle as well as an inch or so to her bust and butt. But for Jalinda it was a different story, her job was mostly giving out orders to the staff, checking the paper work, cooking food, and serving drinks from the bar, none of which built up a lot of sweat. So by the end of the month the extra eating was already starting to show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalinda had always been a full figured women but after a month of stressful eating the most fattening food she was borderline fat. Her hips, breasts, and butt had all grown noticeably bigger over the weeks. She didn't mind too much because Thulka seemed to enjoy her larger curves, but the soft cushion that now covered her once solid abs and the second chin that was beginning to form on her face made her nervous. She knew Thulka would love her no matter what, but this, combined with their failure to use the Seed, didn't stop her from worrying about their future together.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was towards the end of the month when she was thinking about this that Jalinda reached her decision to travel to the city of Ogma to see if her old friend, Grand Master Mage Gringen, could tell them how to use it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be nice to see that nutty old bastard again,\" said Thulka after Jalinda told her wife her decision. The two were laying in their bed, taking a break from a session of intercourse, with the two women facing each other. \"And I've been wanting to see you back in your old adventuring gear for eternity. However I hope you wanting to come isn't for other reasons.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do need to sell some of the loot you collected on your last adventure,\" responded Jalinda. \"But I bet that isn't what you were talking about.\" She countinued holding on to her small but growing belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have put on some weight this month, and I just want to reassure you that you don't feel like you have to lose weight for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that, sweetie. It's just if we do succeed in having a child and I end up the mother, I want to make sure that my health won't put me or the baby at risk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your boobies will get smaller,\" teased Thulka. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh cry me a river,\" Jalinda teased back. \"Besides I'm not the only one who's put on weight, or was it my imagination this morning when you struggled to get your pants over your ass.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I like your boobies,\" pouted Thulka, making sure to give the big puppy eyes as she did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just imagine how much better and bigger they will be when they are overflowing with milk to feed our child which will be causing me to grow larger and larger for nine whole months.\" Jalinda was now whispering in Thulka's ear while one of her hands rubbed the ogress's crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOHHH!\" Moaned Thulka as she felt her lower parts grow moist from the rubbing and Jalinda's sugar covered words. \"You are an evil little temptress Jalinda, you know that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not evil, Thulka,\" said Jalinda with a the grin of a mad women. \"This is evil!\" She then tackled her wife off the bed where they would find themselves the next morning, awakening amid a mess of blankets, sheets, and the thick smell of sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

We'll never leave.\"  Thulka smiled.   \"Or if we did, with the way you make breakfast afterward they'd have to roll us both all the way to Ogma.  Come; a day on the road ought to tone those plump little sausage legs of yours a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOgma was several days' travel away, but fortunately the roads were well traveled, and got busier and busier as they approached the great city.   There were plenty of inns (\"not as nice as ours, of course\", Jalinda said of every one) and after a hard day on the road, the soft beds and hot baths were welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are out of shape for this,\" Thulka teased her wife at the first stop.  Jalinda gingerly lowered herself onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so-ho-ho sore,\" the poor barmaid groaned.  \"My ass feels like it's been slapped with a board for ten hours straight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even think about it!  In fact, don't think of anything dirty.  I don't even want to <i>move</i> until morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you lie back, and let me do all the work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJalinda soon toughened up to riding, and after the first few nights they enjoyed testing out exactly how strong the beds were along the road to Ogma.   Despite the constant exercise, Jalinda also insisted on putting the kitchen staff through their paces, and thus hadn't managed to take off even a pound by the time they came in sight of the massive walled city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing through the west gate, the two women found themselves entering a bustling world of crowds and commerce.  To Thulka, used to the open land and the empty sky, it was nerve-wracking, and she constantly fought the impulse to pull out Head-Smarsherizer and thin out the crowds a little.  Jalinda, however, was in merchant's heaven, her eyes sparkling with every sight of an exotic shop or strange stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all that was settled, they made their way through several small back alleys until they reached a tower climbing towards the sky. If it had been located anywhere else, it would have dominated the skyline. In Ogma, it was merely one of the large towers, cathedrals, and castles that made up the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the couple entered the tower, they heard a squawk. Thulka looked up and saw a blue parrot roosting in a nook on the wall. \"I was wondering when you'd get here,\" the parrot said in a high-pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still need to work on your greetings, Ruffles,\" Thulka replied. \"Could you let Gringen know we're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure, of course. Make poor Ruffles do all the work,\" the parrot pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're his bloody familiar. You're supposed to be working for him,\" Thulka growled with a little more intensity that she would have normally used. She was still on edge, being in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" Ruffles sighed, and he took of and flew up a staircase. A few minutes later, a small figure descended. He was only a few feet tall, not even tall enough to reach Thulka's waist. His head was bald, but his white beard and mustache were very impressive. He wore a simple robe of green, which matched the color of his eyes. Moving surprisingly fast for one so old, he crossed from the stairs and got close enough to where Thulka could pick him up and hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Not so rough! You'll crush this old gnome to a pulp!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka said him down. \"It's been too long, Gringen,\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has indeed, Thulka. And who is this you've brought with you?\" Gringen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, let me introduce you both. Gringen, this is my wife, Jalinda. Jalinda, this is Gringen,\" Thulka said, gesturing between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your mythical wife is real? And here I thought you only said that to ward off Medusa's advances,\" Gringen chortled. He then let out a sigh. \"I do wish this was just to introduce us, but that's not the way you work, Thulka. What can I help you with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow feeling a twinge of guilt, Thulka reached into her pack and withdrew the Seed of Galati. At once, Gringen's jaw dropped. \"Is... is that what I think it is?\" Gringen stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hydra I killed to find it certainly thought so,\" Thulka responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This really is serious for the both of you, isn't it?\" Gringen said, looking at the women with a new understanding in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... We would be grateful if you could help us,\" Jalinda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGringen took in a deep breath. \"I'll do all I can. I'll need some time to consult my library. Come back tomorrow, and I'll see what I can do for you.\" The old gnome then looked up the stairs and began shouting orders to his familiar. Sensing that they had best leave, Thulka and Jalinda exited the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n24 hours later, Thulka and Jalinda returned to the tower. Their day had been filled with a whirlwind of shopping, followed by a night of cuddling in the inn (they both had been tired, and hadn't wanted to disturb anyone else staying overnight). Gringen was waiting for them, with a few dusty tomes sitting on tables dotted around the floor. Ruffles the parrot had fallen asleep on one of the open books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're here! Wonderful!\" Gringen said. \"I think I've found some clue that can help you. I'm sure you're familiar with the Legend of the Divine Daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That old story? The story about the Goddess Galati and her mortal lover Halin?\" Jalinda responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only the entire reason I sought out the blasted thing in the first place...\" Thulka grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, my dear!\" Gringen said, ignored Thulka's sulking. \"Now as you know, their daughter, Galalin, went on to become a mighty heroine in her own right-\" The gnome stopped for a moment as he saw a frustrated look on Thulka's face, and cleared his throat. \"-Ahem, but that isn't what is important. It's the existence of the Divine Daughter. You see, to use the Seed of Galati to have the children you want, you need to...\"</span></div></div>",

Regardless of whether the goblins would be cowed into submission without a fight, or in need of having some sense pounded into them, either result would be a welcome distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rode on, down into the dale, the signs of a goblin infestation growing more and more evident. Low-hanging branches snapped off of trees, stones and anthills overturned and cleaned out, and gnaw marks on pretty much everything. Another hour of riding and a great goblin warren stood before her, the earthen mound pockmarked with holes to clamber into and out of, and a set of gates made of pig bones tied with twine barred the largest opening. Thulka snorted. She could've broken it down with a sneeze. Instead, she'd make her presence known another way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dismounted Enormerous, and, Head-Smasherizer in hand, bellowed out her most intimidating war cry.<br>\r\nThe response was swift, if rather panicked. A few goblins tumbled out of the upper stories in surprise, but by the time they scrabbled back in, armed guards had emerged, heads protected by cow-skull helms, flint-tipped spears clutched in gnarled hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll grew quiet. The goblin guardsmen steeled themselves. Thulka smirked. A hundred of them couldn't have stopped her, clobbering this handful wouldn't even be good exercise. She tensed her muscles, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, obnoxious sound pierced the silence, like a bone-saw through a roasted fellswine haunch. It had come from inside the goblin hold. A call to arms?<br>\r\n\"All hail Chief Fuzgriggle!\" shrieked a reedy, nasally voice from behind the bone gates, which shortly swung open after another noisome blast from the goblin horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guards flung themselves to the ground as a pompous-looking goblin sauntered out of the gate, followed by a timid entourage of servants. The carved stump on his head and worg-pelt cape wrapped round his bony shoulders marked him as a chieftain, and only he seemed unafraid of the interloper that stood before them.<br>\r\n\"Greetings, Thulka Thudcrush!\" the lead goblin whinged, raising an arm magnanimously. \"And welcome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How have you come to know my name, little green-skin?\" Thulka asked, lowering her club, but only a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I not? The mighty ogress who's ravaged the Northern countryside for half a season, striking fear in the hearts of every tall-folk and point-ear in the downs? Your reputation precedes you, Lady Thudcrush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka had never been called 'Lady' before. She decided she didn't like it. \"Cease your flattery, toad! Why do you dare approach me? You've something cooking in that filthy little skull of yours, haven't you? Out with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Straight to the point, eh? Admirable.\" The chief goblin let out a little chuckle, like swamp water gurgling down a rusty drain. \"You're quite right, of course. I've not come forth from the safety of my throne-pit to shower an invader with blandishments. I've a proposition for you, Lady Thudcrush...\"</span></div></div>",

She needed a filling meal if she was going to continue on her rampage without delay. The humans of the nearby town would likely turn her down, if not outright lynch her if knowledgeable about her recent pillaging. The goblins, on the other hand, would have offered nothing: neither resistance to her intrusion or a filling meal. Even if there were around five of them, their puny size would have made them small snacks at best. Thulka realized their was only one choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnormous was going to be her meal. And a filling meal he was sure to make. As a great oxen, he far surpassed the smaller size of his closely related relatively, topping out at just above five feet in height. Colossal muscles clung to his legs, allowing him to carry all of the loot Thulka had acquired thus far. And finally, like most oxen, he also sported a thick layer of fat, hence his name. All in all, the majestic beast clocked in at over four thousand pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunger in control, Thulka jumped off the beast and readied her giant mace. A single swing was all it took to bring her faithful servant's life to and end. It's lifeless body collapsed to the ground, sending out a tremor that nearly swept the ogress off of her feet. Though he was dead, Enormous was far from finished serving his mistress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka knelt down, reaching for the saddle bag. It had nearly been crushed during the commotion but thankfully escaped harm. Reaching inside, she pulled out the necessary tools: a carving machete, flint and tinder, and a load of spices. She had looted them from a noble's house the last town over and was eager to give them a taste. Blade in hand, she set the blade against Enormous's neck and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, and the deed was done. Enormous has been thoroughly cleaned of his edible parts, leaving behind little more than bones and organs. A raging fire had been started as well. It burned brightly against the setting sun, fighting against it with it's rapidly growing brilliance. Besides it sat Thulka, armed with a piercing rod,  and the spoils of the oxen's demise. She was all set to begin roasting when she realized something awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnormous had been carrying the bulk of her things. Without him, she could probably manage to drag her new loot until a new mount was procured.  However, she hadn't been taking into account all the meat. As gluttonous as she was feeling, she couldn't imagine eating it all in one night. Nor could she stomach leaving such delicious food behind. What was a poor ogress to do? </span></div></div>",

As painful as it was surely going to be, Thulka was going to have to stuff herself to oblivion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly, the yellow giant groped into the pile beside her, pulling out a five pound chunk of oxen meat. Without delay she shoved her piercing rod into the moist flesh. She pressed down hard, letting it slide to around the halfway point. It stuck fast to the metal stick, holding firm even when she gave it a inquisitive shake. Confident with its stability, she at last shoved the meat into the wild blaze, engulfing it in flames. It crackled as the moisture within started to boil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, Thulka pulled the meat out. She had timed it well; the meat had been charred to absolute perfection. It gave off a pleasant, savory smell. Her mouth salivated in anticipation as the starved barbarian brought it up to her thick lips. Like a snapping turtle she shot forward, her strong jaw easily severing half of the meat off the rod. It was sent to the back of her wet mouth, sliding down her throat without a single chew. Thulka rubbed her exposed, flat abs in relief. It felt good to have some REAL food in her stomach for a change. Smiling ear to ear, she followed up and bit off the last half as easily as the first. It joined its other half in her grumbling, near empty stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later and Thulka sat half awake against the slowly dying fire. The pile of meat was noticeably smaller; a rather large chunk of it sat in her filled pained stomach. It strained outwards, bulging out in a spherical shape. The pounds of meat gave her midsection an almost pregnant look. Thulka, her mind thoroughly weakened by the stuffing, collapsed to the side, exhausted. She drifted off to sleep, her stomach churning madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka awoke with a pleasant yawn, the sun shining warmly on her face. The fire had died naturally and the meat pile seemed undisturbed. To her side lay the piercing rod, still holding a piece she had neglected to eat. Most importantly, though, was her stomach. While not nearly as bulbous as it had been, it pushed outward slightly. Not putting much thought into it, she assumed that she had not fully digested her meal. Little did she know, she had in fact gained a few pounds of fat, manifesting on her in the form of a small potbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Thulka began to pack her things to leave. She had places to go and people to pillage, after all. It didn't take long and before long she set off, her new potbelly jiggling with each step.

There was absolutely no reason for her not to; the weight of her magnificent plunder would be unbearable for an extended journey. Worst of all, a full load meant that she all new plunder would go to waste!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good half an hour passed before the ogress found herself at the edge of the humble human hamlet. A few dozen tiny thatched roof cottages speckled the forest clearing in which the town laid, their monotony broken every so often by shops or merchant stalls. Judging by their size and sparsity, Thulka estimated that their had to be around a hundred inhabitants of this place. Most surprising of all was the village's defenselessness; from her position, she saw no semblance of the law. A perfect target for a pillage, if only she had the will to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued by this undefended village, Thulka made her way into the village with booming stomps. There was no real gate for her to pass through; only a larger opening between two houses with a sign that said \"Welcome!\" clued her in. Dust flew into the air with each aggravated stomp, leaving a thick brown cloud behind her. It was not a subtle entrance, nor a particularly friendly one, but she knew it was for the best. If they were to be hostile, at least she would know before she wound up trapped in the village center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the plan, at least. A finely sharpened spear found its way to her midsection as her foot passed the first building, stopping just before it finished its deadly thrust. Two more appeared in an instant, holding fast at her neck and chest before the stunned woman could reach for ol' Head-Smasherizer. Standing beside her were three men, decked out in leather armor and wielding the spears the held her in place. From their posture, it was clear they weren't out for her blood, but they were by no means friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raaaaaaaaaaaawr!\" she roared in defiance. \"Let me free, you stinking humans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn most cases, her ear-splitting roar was enough to send people running, but these men did not move an inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still, you bloody ogress, our mage will be here shortly to verify you,\" the man jutting her stomach said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer anger unabated, she bellowed out another roar, once again to no affect. A tense minute passed as Thulka and her captors stared each other down, both hoping the other would grant them a chance to strike out. Alas, the moment never came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I'm here,\" said an aged voice from behind the ogress. \"Oh my, she's quiet a big one, isn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning her head around, Thulka's eyes met with the source. It was an older looking gentleman, face wrinkled like an old raisin and balder than a newborn. His brown robes were etched with countless arcane symbols, the most prominent of which was a symbol of a glowing hog. Without warning, the man raised his left hand and shoved it into Thulka's pudgy gut. An unintelligible whisper of magical escaped from his withered lips. A pulsing warmth radiated from his palm, tickling her stomach. She would have laughed, if not for being so furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see,\" the wizard began, \"From what my 'Composition' spell can tell, she's not eaten humans. All this fat's from a mule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's not fat! I'm just digesting a meal from earlier...\" she said, embarrassed. Ogres were renowned for their great strength, not their great girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bull!\" the wizard shouted as he slapped the flesh, causing her pudgy fat to jiggle. \"A stuffed stomach wouldn't jiggle like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, I aughta k-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet, both of you!\" the man poking her stomach shouted. \"Now then, Ogress, since you haven't eaten any humans, you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With her anger still blazing like a oil fire, she was tempted to strike the fools down now, but held back. There would be absolutely nothing to gain from such wanton violence. Still, the wizard's comments on her fat had bruised her titanic pride. Plans for revenge against the old geezer began to take form in her mind as she left the four behind, ducking into the safety of the nearby general store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an unimposing little shop, its worn counters and shelves littered with ragged and damaged wares. Nothing of particular value seemed to reside within its walls, dampening her hopes for a big pay off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone here?\" she asked to the empty shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, miss,\" a woman replied, popping up from behind a counter. She was a chubby girl, blessed with curly blonde locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" the shop-keep continued, \"You must have been the one stomping around out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, I like to make my presence known. Now then, are you interested in purchasing some of my loot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka reached back into her satchel and tossed it onto the nearby counter, letting its glittering contents tumble into the open. It was a beautiful assortment of jewels and jewelry, worth hundreds of gold. An impressive sight; one that made the shopkeepers eyes go wide in pure awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, where did you get all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not important. What matters is the price, woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Straight to the point, eh?\" she said as she examined the bounty laid before her. \"Well, with all of this here, I could offer you... 800 gold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Try 1500, at the very least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, ogress, but have you seen our village? You think I have enough on me for that? 1000 at the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThulka turned to the nearby window, uttering an annoyed grunt. First she had been hassled and now she wasn't even going to get the full price for her items. Looking through the glass pane, Thulka noticed something she had missed on the way in. Chained to a post beside the shop was a great oxen, not unlike Enormous. Like most of the village, it was an old thing, more fat than muscle.

Her face now upturned, their gazes met once more. A divine sense of belonging radiated from her lord's perfect face. It filled Eilowyn with an overwhelming feeling. One that she hadn't felt in all her time serving Eola on the front lines. Cutting down undead had never felt <i>this</i> good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, next up is your blessing then! I hope you enjoy it, Eilly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA playful smile crossed Eola's face as she snapped her glowing fingers. In an instant, Eilowyn's robust suit of plate vanished in a puff of smoke, leaving her hefty bosom hanging plainly in the air. Twinges of regret shot through the young servant. She was well aware that the armor would serve her no longer but something inside couldn't let go of it so easily.  Sensing her servant's growing regret, Eola bent forward and met her lips with Eilowyn's. Eilly's eyes grew wide. She had been caught off guard, but after a moment, closed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange, almost magical, wave of energy began to leave the goddess's body. Like a snake is traveled through her puckered lips and forced its way into the dwarf's. From there it continued on, crawling down her throat. Surprisingly, Eilly didn't seem to mind the feeling. Like the gaze, it was comforting in a way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Eola pulled away, a thin string of spit still connecting the two. She gazed downwards past Eilly's breasts and began to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny, milord?\" Eilly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughing woman reached forward and squeezed a part of her body that Eilly didn't know existed. She knew that there should have been nothing to grab yet the playful pinching sensation continued. Parting her breasts, she at last got a clear view of her body. Her stomach, once flat from her order's exercise routine, had been blessed with a small pocket of fat.  The soft excess flesh hung off hung from her abdomen as Eola continued to fondle it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do ya like it, Eilly? You look soooo cute with this belly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what is feels like to have fat? I must say, I can't exactly complain.\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! I knew you'd love it! Now, you'll find more elastic clothing in that box over there, alright?\" Eola said, motioning to a small box to Eilly's right. \"Now go and become my blubbery avatar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer work done, the goddess disappeared as quickly as she had come, taking the ethereal warmth with her. Left alone, Eilly rifled through the box and pulled out her new uniform. It was a form fitting thing, low cut to show off her deep cleavage and containing a gap at her midsection to show off her growing belly. The symbol of her goddess was embroidered neatly in the space between the openings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering her supplies, Eilly decided to go to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were supposed to give a paladin on business anything she asked for, of course, but he didn't know how they were going to spare the expense -- they needed the money those crops would bring in just to pay the landlord and mend the plow before next season.   Perhaps the gods were punishing him.  What was he going to tell his wife, Old Herbetta, and his son, Old Herbert the Younger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I wouldn't expect you to do it for free,\" the paladin said, tossing the farmer a few gold coins.  \"Here.

Getting the breastplate to meet with the backplate was like trying to close an overfilled suitcase.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHup, hup, hyyyuhh!

So, grabbing her saber, she went to the center of the ring composed of her fellow paladins, Robin waiting with her own weapon drawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May Eola bless this battle,\" Robin stated, her eyes never leaving Eilowyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarf nodded at her human sister and before she could blink Robin was on her, slashing and thrusting. Blocking the initial slash, she dodged the thrust by a hair, a wheeze escaping her lips as she did so. Robin smirked and pressed on, but the dwarf managed to either counter or dodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit dancing and fight me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEilowyn did so, launching her own mighty thrust, Robin managing to block and return with a slash of her own. Blocking it, Eilowyn pushed then and Robin landed on her rear. Face red, Robin aimed for the dwarf's legs, scoring a minor hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the slight flare of pain, Eilowyn used Robin's confidence to her advantage, using the hilt of her sword to strike a strong blow against Robin's head, dazing the famed warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence reigned all around and Robin's standard bearer declared Eilowyn the winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin got to her feet, a bit shaky and bowed to her dwarf sister. \"I...I have lost...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said this, the golden glow of Eola gathered around Robin and the gathered paladins, save Eilowyn, gaped as Robin's body changed. Her toned middle expanded, becoming a hefty belly, her thighs and rear growing to a heavy size as well. Lastly, her breasts and face puffed outwards, a few chins dangling beneath her original one, Robin's armor now at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEola herself soon appeared after that, the goddess appearing quite tubby as well, though not as much as Robin herself was. \"Let this weight be a reminder of the dangers of assumptions, Robin Starwind.

I will accept this weight and obey your wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEola's stern demeanor dropped in an instant and she easily picked up Robin and hugged her now fat servant tightly. \"Oh Robin! You're almost as cute as Eilly with your serious ways!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin blushed heavily but accepted the outburst as well as the big kiss Eola placed on her stomach and fat cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've appeared before you mortals enough for one day.

That is...unless you appease us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-BURAAAPPP-what do I have to do?\" Snip asked, blushing after her belch but grabbing up even more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's simple Snip. You merely have to get past the many traps and monsters surrounding the Orc King's fabled tomb and steal the greatest jewel of the lot as you promised poor Alys here,\" Theodora answered, motioning towards her pixie companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Snip was well and truly stuffed, her halfling stomach bulging and taut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I shall do this and you shall release the spell, agreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheodora smirked as she shook her former lover's hand, poking Snip's stomach afterwards, Snip belching again and groaning. \"Of course, my bloated halfling. But you need your rest, do you not? Such a large amount of food in that trim stomach of yours. I wonder where it will end up after it has digested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlys giggled at that and darted in front of Snip's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Tubby Thief is a title I feel you should get used to before too long, my dear Snip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlys placed a kiss on Snip's middle then and darted away to Theodora's shoulder, Snip sighing and making her way up to her rented room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was so stuffed, even a slow amble gave her a stitch in her side.  <i>This is going to slow me down</i>, she realized.  And she couldn't exactly afford to be slowed down.   It would take her about a week to reach the tomb traveling at her normal speed ... more, the slower she got, and the slower she got, the fatter she'd be when she got there.  And fat thieves soon found themselves in tight spots on the job.  <i> Hmm, figure seven days, plus at least three... maybe if I sleep less, and walk more--</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well.  I didn't know you'd gotten knocked up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnip looked up crossly into the smirking face of One-Eyed Rance, the handsome <i>but annoying</i> and suave <i>but annoying</i> human safecracker she'd paired up with on a couple of occasions -- in bed, of course, she'd never sully herself <i>professionally</i> with such a rank amateur.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not,\" she snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis amethyst eyes twinkled with amusement.  He had two eyes -- he only called himself 'One-Eyed' because it confused the people looking for him.    \"Oh, I know.  The whole inn was buzzing about the way you demolished the menu last night -- and again this morning, if looks don't deceive.  Isn't it hard to walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make do,\" she said shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked on in silence for a while as the sun rose higher in the sky and the dew burned off, the sound of distant birdsong all that met their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather handle this on my own, if you don't mind,\" Snip said when it became obvious he wasn't going to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the old orc's tomb, that thing?  You can be my guest, when we come to that.  <i>I </i>certainly don't care to muck around in some moldy old crypt when the rich keep such clean houses.  Until then, it's everybody's road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the space around me.  That's <i>my </i>road,\" Snip explained, pulling out a few knives, \"and <i>here</i> and <i>here</i> are my bodyguards, so I suggest you --<i> ooh!</i>\"   Her stomach gurgled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry already?\"  Rance raised one coal-black eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell.  I thought I'd be at least to Stonewood by the time I needed to eat again.   Now I'll have to look for an orchard or something.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to turn off the road when she sensed something flying at her, and caught it on a dagger without looking.  It turned out to be a sweet roll.  She looked back at Rance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suspected you might need a little something extra along the way,\" he shrugged.   \"Or a lot of something.  Honestly, you don't think you're going to be able to carry enough supplies to get all that way on your <i>own</i>, do you?   You'll be chewing your own arms off halfway across the Gray Plains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnip munched the sweet roll sullenly.   The obnoxious thing was, he was right.   \"And I suppose you're coming just out of the kindness of your own heart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed.  \"Of course not!  You're my friend, Snip, I don't want to see you starve in the wilderness.\"  He grinned cruelly.   \"But you're also one of the best thieves in Squallhirst, and that means you're one of my competitors.  It can hardly hurt my own bottom line if I fatten up those quick little fingers of yours a bit, now can it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnip gulped.   </span></div></div>",

Rance sighed as he wandered back to check on Snip.  <i> What a waste of a saucy wench!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Speaking of saucy wenches, the halfling definitely qualified at this point.   Buried in her I-don't-know-how-many-th basket of juicy pork ribs, she was an absolute mess, both her face and her hands smeared with the tangy sauce.

Her efforts were in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as the wand is pointed at a sapient being, said sapient being must do anything the holder of the wand demands.\" She gasped. \"In addition, the commands effects will remain indefinitely after-wards, it can change the very heart and soul\" her eyes widened in fear as she spoke.

Suddenly, her mind was filled with thoughts of gallons of warm, pulsing blood, thick with the taste of raw beef.   Thundering hooves and frightened lowing filled her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cow.  I've got to have cow!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving the woman in front of her aside, as if in a dream, she stumbled forward.  The peasants kept dairy herds, she knew.    If she sent her servants now, she could have a cow here within the hour.    Her throat felt so parched, and only one thing could quench the thirst...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one great, guttural moo, her mind went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorissa came to her senses some time later, feeling sick and heavy.   She was in her bedchamber, tangled in the sheets, her powder-white body completely nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, no longer powder-white, for as she looked down at herself she realized that she was flushed almost to the color of a tomato, and her stomach was so distended it could have been mistaken for one.   She coughed and sputtered, spitting up a few drops of blood.    She was so full that lying on her back made it hard to breathe, though she didn't technically need to.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled over onto her side, feeling the immense amount of liquid sloshing around inside her belly and guts like a waterbed.   Lying next to the bed, legs in the air, was a dead cow.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nDon't tell me I drank the whole thing myself</i>, Morissa thought.  She belched, and another thin stream of blood dribbled down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of her fingers, she summoned her phantasmal servants to clean the bedchamber, remove the dried-out cow, and scrub her clean.  When they'd finished, she slipped into her loosest robe and, with some difficulty, sat up, sloshing audibly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" she grunted miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part was, in the back of her mind, she knew the compulsion would return.

So that left her with only one option: visiting Lura Collan, a powerful wizard she had tried to toy with seven decades ago, ending in her stuck in the form of a pig for a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, adopting her most apologetic expression, she set out for the wizard's tower with her servants, occasionally stopping for cows along the way, which explained, when the elven Lura opened her tower door, she saw a chubby vampire with a tubby rear end, a pot-belly that was on the verge of becoming a gut, and a round face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great Lura, I require your assistance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLura chuckled inwardly, though outwardly she allowed herself to delight in this undead creature's new figure. It was one of her quirks, as wizard's were often guilty of having them, and one that always brought her heart to hammering whenever she spied a woman's over-fed figure or expanding body. Of her countless female lover's over the centuries, not a one had left her without an extra fifty to a hundred, and in one dwarf's case five hundred, pounds courtesy of Lura's skills in the kitchen and magical prowess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My soul's bond that I will not harm a sentient being for a century, feasting on animals only.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really so desperate to lose this weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not the weight!

Send your servants back to your lair and come stay with me and I'll end your compulsion along with your promised soul bond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariska nodded and soon entered the tower, wondering, for a brief moment, if she would have been better off going to grab the wand from the wench instead.</span></div></div>",

How long before Lura could help her, and how large would she grow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariska strode up the tower's stairs, trying to ignore her thighs brushing together. She was trying to figure out a diplomatic, yet forceful way to get Lura to speed up whatever she was doing, when it hit her. Something she hadn't thought of in centuries. Food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of a hundred dishes, each more wondrous that the last, assaulted her. <i>What was going on? Vampires don't eat food...</i> Her cloudy certainty didn't stop her from chasing the delightful odor up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting at the top of the stairs was a huge dining table, groaning under the weight of the food piled atop it. Her hunger intensified to dizzying levels <i>This is just like with the cows! </i>Was the last thought she had before everything faded to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mariska regained her senses, she was sprawled atop the huge table, now covered in empty plates. Her stomach was again massively bloated, towering over her packed with solids, not liquid. The vampire moaned, and belched explosively. The foreign sensation of being stuffed full of food overwhelmed her undead senses; she squirmed back and forth but felt helpless to move or even summon a servant spell. A shadow passed over her, and Mariska's eyes flickered open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLura stood over her, the grinning wizardess reaching out to smooth back the fattened vampire's hair. \"I knew the experiment would work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha...*belch*\" was all Mariska could manage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The compulsion is too strong for me to just cancel, so I tried to change the focus.\" Her hands traced over the vast arc of Mariska's belly. \"And I was able to change in from cow blood to cow meat during the day, and from cow meat to food in general - that last part took all night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariska's eyes flickered over to the window Lura was standing in front of. She could see dawn approaching. <i>I was eating... all night?!</i> Mariska groaned wordlessly, which only seemed to widen Lura's smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeell, now that I know how do affect the compulsion, I can work on lessening the effects. And now that you're eating my delicious food...\" Mariska felt a tremble pass through her. \"I can keep you here to experiment on instead of having you roam the land, looking for livestock.\" Mariska felt there was a slight gap in the wizardess's logic, but was too bloated and woozy to voice a protest. With a gesture, Lura levitated the bloated vampire and guided her downstairs into the coffin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry dear, this will all be over before much longer!\" The coffin's lid closed, barely able to fit over her obese stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariska moaned again, her hands tracing across the bloated ball of her gut as the sun's rising slowly made her drift off to sleep. This was no cure! How much larger would she get, stuffed full of fattening foods instead of blood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLura giggled widely, her cheeks flushed. The spells had been hard work, but the reward had been watching a gorgeous elven babe stuff herself to a level only something with an undead creature's dulled pain receptors could manage. Oh yes, she would 'cure' Mariska. She'd solve all of her problems, all right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Golden light flooded her eyes and mout, and large silver wings stretched out beside her. Her gaze turned to the vampiress, and she spoke in a voice that filled the room like molten gold. \"OOPS, INDEED,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to keep her eyes locked on the strange creature as long as possible, Morissa glanced toward her wand of compulsion, on the floor a few feet away, and began a slow, stealthy sidle over toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angel continued to speak. \"MORISSA THORNE,\" She said, raising an accusatory finger to the vampire, \"I AM THE MAGIC EATER, ENVOY OF THE GREAT KIOS, GODDESS OF JUSTICE AND BALANCE. YOUR ACTIONS HAVE GONE UNCHECKED FOR TOO LONG. THE SCALES MUST BE BALANCED. PREPARE YOURSELF.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorissa made a quick tumble, snatching her wand from the ground, and immediately firing it's beam toward the strange angel. Even though Morissa was fast, the Magic Eater was immediate, right up next to Morissa before she even realized it had moved. The wand's beam flew harmlessly into the ground. Morissa watched helplessly as the steel woman effortlessly wrested the wand from her hand, and brought it close to her face. \"NOT THIS TIME,\" she said, snapping like a twig between her fingers. The wand exploded in a torrent of blue-green mist, with an otherworldly glow. The Magic Eater closed her eyes, and took a slow, deep breath, inhaling all of the mist into her glowing mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorissa staggered back in confusion and horror as the strange creature turned to face her. As it advanced, she couldn't help noticing that her attacker's steel curves had filled out somewhat. Her thighs were thicker, her hips were wider, and her stomach wasn't nearly as sculpted. The now-voluptuous creature moved slowly toward the shellshocked vampire girl. Morissa felt the Magic Eater's vice grip tighten on her shoulders, lifting her up off the ground. The Magic Eater stared deep into her with it's glowing eyes, and then deeply inhaled. Moriss screamed as an otherworldly heat filled her body, her vision filled with red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, suddenly, it was over. Morissa crumpled to the ground, as the last of the magic drained from her. She looked up at the face of the Magic Eater, who was licking her lips. Her softened stomach had inflated to a roll of steel fat, resting comfortably on her generous, child bearing hips. The creature seemed almost preoccupied with itself, cradling it's belly fondly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorissa, still lying broken on the floor, looked down at her hands. The color had rushed back into her eerily pale skin, and she felt a warmth from within herself. \"I'm...\" She said, weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALIVE,\" the Magic Eater said, \"WELCOME TO THE HUMAN RACE, MORISSA THORNE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA zap of energy, and the chubby angel was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorissa was left on the floor of her chambers, broken.

She squinted and looked at her open palms, stretching out her fingers and then pulling them back in to make a pair of fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long has it been...\u201d, muttered Morissa as she sat, staring in disbelief at herself in a mirror across from her that had fell and broken from the actions of the Magic Eater. A ragged crack shot straight up, dividing her flushed face in half. She reached a hand up to feel her pink flesh, her fingers darting away when the touch brought no coldness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe prodded and inspected her newly living body for several minutes, this unfamiliar feeling bringing in curious sensations with each touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...I...I hate this. The warmth, it...I cannot stay like this! I must regain my vampire abilities. I must...\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorissa nodded briskly to herself, standing up in the middle of the trashed living room. The intervention from that Angel had made a wreck of her property; curtains ripped, books strewn across the floor, paintings either crooked or fallen. <i><b>Such a mess</b></i>, thought Morissa. With steady steps she made her way to the cabinets across the room, searching for any coins that she could pocket. It was her home, of course, but Morissa knew in her beating heart that it would be awhile before she returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the coins packed away safely, she turned and headed for the entryway to the manor. A quick look back at the disheveled room did nothing but further her need to get on her way. Where exactly Morissa was headed, she wasn't too sure of herself. She just knew that she had to find another vampire somewhere, and soon, else she go mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out into the sun was...to say the least, frightening for Morissa. She braced her arms over her face, protecting herself from the rays of the sun...only to remember that she was living. \u201cOh, right...I'm mortal. Daylight won't hurt me...\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, she took ginger steps across the dirt walkway, wary eyes looking to and fro as she got a hold of her surroundings. There was a minor chill to the air due to the manor being located at the foot of a range of mountains. Ignoring the chill, Morissa made her way down the trail, eying a lone red apple that hung from a tree. She grabbed at it, the crisp fruit being the first food she had laid eyes on since changing. She flashed her teeth and opened her mouth, planting the apple just below her top row of teeth. Without thinking she stabbed her teeth into the apple, attempting to suck the juice from the apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Morissa blinked and paused, glancing down at the apple punctured on her teeth. With a roll of her eyes and a loud sigh, she shifted the apple and took a bite from the fruit this time. The sweet taste of the apple's flesh brought on a swath of flavor to Morissa's palate, and she found herself taking several more bites until the core remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe taste of apples...I'd forgotten how sweet they are!\u201d Morissa let out a small snicker, feeling a smidgen more comfortable after eating that apple. With a snack taken care of, she once again started walking, the end of the road her destination for the time being. </span></div></div>",

The beast was immense.   Morissa attempted to back up, only to find herself blocked by one leathery wing the size of a galleon's mainsail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me, dragon!\" Morissa snarled, snatching up the wand and aiming it at the scaly face.  The dragon laughed, plucked up the wand as one might pluck a toothpick, and snapped it in half.

Morissa heard the crunch and snap of her skeletal servants being crushed into powder by the collapse of a good portion of the east wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, little vampire, I believe you were about to have a little nip from me?\" the dragon asked jovially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No -- no, of course not --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon chuckle.  \"Now, don't be shy.  Come!  Drink your fill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne huge claw seized Morissa and shoved her face-first into the dragon's flank, forcing her down until her fangs burst painfully through the scales.  Suddenly, hot dragon blood flowed into Morissa's throat.  It was like drinking liquid fire, and yet somehow, underneath it all, there were rich tones and subtle flavors as well.  It poured into Morissa's belly like white-hot rubies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glmp!\"  she said, fighting the claw.  \"Glmph!  Mmph!\"    High-pressure jets of blood forced themselves into her faster than she could guzzle them down, leaking out around her lips and dribbling to the floor, where they smoked and steamed on the ancient tile.  Her stomach was growing full and taut, and yet she knew she hadn't yet tasted one thousandth of all the blood in the wyrm's monstrous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when she was resigning herself to drinking until she burst, the dragon yanked her off again and set her back down roughly.  She wobbled, feeling her innards slosh uncomfortably.   She was bloated to the point of repletion, flushed tomato-red, full as a tick.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you like your snack?\" the dragon asked.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morissa cupped her hands against her large, plump belly, squeezing it between her palms, as if in denial that this could be real. Sure enough it was, as the belly fat squished and bulged underneath her hands as she beheld as her belly was of such size, it possessed both a paunch and a haunch for the former to rest upon. Then again, it was a bit hard to see past her large, fat breasts which could no longer keep a pert shape and rested against the top of her belly's curve. Her ass, however, seemed to prove the centerpiece as it sunk into an impressive impression in the fine mattress of the bed. As she got up to look at it herself in the mirror closer, Morissa could see just how far out from her body, as well as it's impressive, full diameter and how much it jiggled as she stood up. Her pale face flushed red in embarrassment and rage as she beheld her new body. Her once elegant, refined figure now was positively ruined! And all because of a damned dragon. As much as she wanted to punish \"Mariska\" she knew that there was no chance in hell that she could ever slay a dragon. She was not some shining Paladin of The Blessed who could take off her head with a simple crack of her sword but if she was, ohh she would-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pregnant pause as Morissa thought to herself. Of course! She may not have had the power to stand against a Dragon, but if the annals of myth and history books she had read in her long years proved to be true, a hero of good intent could slay that dammed dragon. She would find such a man, someone good and pure and gullible and lead whoever it may be onward to garner the power to slay Mariska and get her revenge. A wicked fanged smile slowly formed on Morissa's pale face as she imagined the look on Mariska's decapitated head as her eye stared up, cold and dead, at the women she never should have wronged. The elvish vampiress brought a hand up to her mouth and laughed crulely as she continued to daydream of her playing the role of an innocent accursed maiden who would help lead this fool-hero to victory!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever her laughter was interrupted as she moaned aloud, feeling Natasha's magical fingers penetrate the silence...among other things. She closed her eyes halfway and eyed the enthralled beauty with lust as she smiled playfully, her fangs visible even as her mouth remained closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHero searching could wait, Morissa thought as, despite her new, tubby body, she glided back into bed and once more, she indulged in her carnal desires.<br>\r\n___________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorissa set out in the morning. Instead of her favourite cloak (Which she, of course outgrew), she took to wearing a simple, but still well designed petticoat with some fine leather boots. Her coat, despite being crafted for her over a good few days to match her figure, was still a bit tight and she felt embarrassed that it seemed to show off her ponderous and jiggly belly. The buttons struggled just to come together fully over her fat breasts, which jiggled modestly underneath. Her trousers also felt painfully tight as her thick, fat legs felt constrained in the fabric as her thighs and upper legs rubbed against the material and her exceptional rear stretched and tightened the poor article in back, as if calling attention to any passing suitors with it's sultry and large shape. As much as she enjoyed her wealth and elegance, she did not lack the sense to know just what an adventure would call for. It would be quite a journey, but she knew that would only help make the end result of her plan for vengeance much more satisfying. She wore a cowl over her head to help hide her piercing, cat like red eyes. She didn't want to risk drawing attention to herself, even if no one would really expect to see a vampire on an overcast day, never mind in broad daylight. Morissa mused to herself at how easy it was for normal mortals to so quickly assume that Vampires shriveled and died in the sun. In reality, Vampires stayed to the night due to the cover of stealth darkness brought about and avoided sun due to the fact it interfered with their innate powers, such as shape-shifting into bats or mist and regeneration. Whatever helped to give them hope, she mused once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nearest township, Ngvar, rested a few mere miles by foot, nestled between burgeoning farmlands and plentiful forestation. It was said that the reason the town itself housed so many trees within itself was because as it was founded and roads were being paved, trees would magically spring from specific spots in the ground and no matter how many of them were cut down for lumber, another would spring up in that same spot. The founding villagers essentially gave up and since built the village around the trees. Since then, the people of Ngvar established a belief of living alongside nature, rather than forcing it to obey their whims and respected the trees and animals that lived within the town's provinces. Morissa found this ideology quaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elven vampire looked studiously at the people from beneath her cowl. Somewhere, somehow, she would find a fitting fighter to aid her. Her boots splashed against thin puddles of water on the ground as she pondered weather or not she would find someone fitting for the task of dragonslaying. True, it would take a great investment of her time, but as both an elf and a vampire she had much to afford. She looked upon the town's Great Church, wondering if there, she could find someone, a fledgling warrior, who couldn't resist aiding her out of the goodness of their heart.</span></div></div>",

Now, as my revenge, I will make you the last vampire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I refuse to help?\" The engorged vampire said defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Mariska simply placed a hand on Morissa's enormous stomach and said a few words in a language Morissa did not understand.

It will never digest. You will not gain any fat, so your body outside of your belly will stay the same You will still get nourishment from the blood though.

Luckily there had been no people inside but Miffie lost her chance at trying the cupcakes and had been punished by Kara with going back to square one with magic lessons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had shamed Miffie, shamed her mother, and shamed her taste-buds, because she really did want those muffins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the worst part was the look of sorrow in her mother's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara had found Miffie as a baby pixie and raised her like a daughter and to see the woman she saw as both mother and mentor suffer because of what she did hurt worse than all of the rest of her suffering combined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, their relationship was improving and now, a full six months since the cupcake incident, things were almost back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie was drawn out of her thoughts by her mother entering her chamber, Miffie again drawn to how ageless she looked, appearing the same now as she did all those decades ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara Skyrider had long black hair, serious dark eyes, and lips that belied the seriousness in her gaze. She was often smiling or joking and it was this part of her more than any other that Miffie had imitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlim and toned, Kara looked more like a warrior than a mage, but she often told Miffie that appearances were nothing. What mattered was the inner self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling as she approached, Kara gently picked up Miffie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been doing so well in your studies I believe a reward is in order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to resume my more advanced training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was thinking more of a treat, something you love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie wriggled around in her palm, smiling as Kara pointed her free hand towards the table.

She hadn't meant to eat the whole thing, she really hadn't, but it had just been so <i>good!</i>   Now she'd stuffed herself with what would have been, to a human, the equivalent of a large birthday cake.  Her stomach was packed tight, and she was beginning to feel queasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the little pixie, Kara looked at her with compassion, but with an amused twinkle in her eye as well.  \"Oh, Miffie, I <i>told </i>you!

Kara always preferred to make tea the old-fashioned way, rather than just snapping it into existence, although she did cheat a bit on the fire \"to save on fuel\".   <i>How am I supposed to practice my self-control if I never get a chance to try it?</i>  She hardly ever got to eat her fill of sweets, so of <i>course</i> on those few occasions when she got the chance, she was going to do it!

It was the same principle, after all.   <i>And if something goes wrong</i>, she reasoned, <i>I'll just clean it up before she gets back.</i>   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pictured a cupcake in her mind -- a mini-cupcake, sized a little more appropriately for her, although still quite large to a pixie -- and held the image.

It was large, considering pixie standards, and fully dressed as every good cupcake should be. Its cup was perfectly white while the chocolatey cap oozed over the sides seductively. Blue frosting crowned the top as it hovered majestically in place, crackling slightly as the magical energies responsible for its birth began to settle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie was awestruck at the majesty of its grace, stepping forward to catch her most excellent of creations as it fell gently into her tiny hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it!\" she beamed, dimples creasing her tiny cheeks as she began to glow slightly.

So if you get too tempted by all those cupcakes... you just cast it on yourself, and presto!  No more cravings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but... won't I starve?\" Miffie asked seriously.  Kara chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you want to eat, you simply invert the spell sigils and the first and fourth variables, and the effect reverses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh.\"  The little pixie thought about this for a minute.  She <i>had</i> kind of wanted to stuff herself with cupcakes... but she didn't want to get too fat to fly, after all!  \"Okay.  Teach me the spell!\"</span></div></div>",

The problem was that there was simply too much magic coursing through her little body and she had no idea how to control it! But under her mother's tutelege, she was beginning to understand how to faucet her abilities. Transformation spells were fun, Alteration enchantments were a bit of a snooze until they came in handy, but <i>Conjuration</i> spells was where Miffie put her money at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic was, however, not to be abused- as her mother so cryptically (and constantly) warned her adoptive daughter. People could get hurt and the caster complacent, which is why she insisted that all of Miffie's household chores be done by hand. Sweeping their entire home with only the assistance of flight, standing at just a bit more of a foot tall, was an unimaginably tiring feat for poor Miffie. So it was an equally unimaginable standard for her to adhere to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing something from one of her mother's old spellbooks, the tiny girl had enchanted one of the brooms of the household into a live-in maid. Using itself to brush the dirt from the floor and into its spellbound companion, the dustpan, the broom made the household chores so much easier on little Miffie- the pixie in question deeming the endless hours she would have spent cleaning much better suited to the fortification of her skills in Magicka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled mischeviously as she tampered with the unfolded handkercheif laid out on the table, the same spellbook opened and leaning against the wall as she skimmed its contents for something interesting to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha!\" she chirped as she fluttered up and above the wooden surface of the table, concentrating her magical energies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she read the incantation, a soft glow enveloped the white fabric of her napkin as the corners lifted themselves into the air. The whole thing began turning and folding as if it were alive until the shape had settled. There, in the air, was her own mock Bishop's hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffe giggled at her creation, amused at her own antics. She then used another spell, one she wasn't too comfortable with, to shrink it. Since it was just a <i>napkin</i> after all, Mother wouldn't be too mad, right? Well, if she found out anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the tiny hat began to shrink to Miffie-size and the tiny figure placed it atop her blue head of hair. Hovering over to a cutting knife used in the preparation of the morning's breakfast, Miffie frowned cutely at the reflection. The hat really didn't suit well with her dress of laurels. Without a second thought she shut her eyes tight, pointed at the shrunken napkin hat atop her head, and concentrated <i>really</i> hard until she felt the slight weight fly away- quite literally. She had turned the hat into a little swan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Miffie laughed. She was getting really good at this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the swan flew to rest on the table, Miffie unfolded it with her magic- effectively killing her creation. It had still remained at it's perfectly miniature size, making it just the right proportions for one of Miffie's itty-bitty meals to rest on. Speaking of meals, Miffie hadn't had one all day. Perhaps a little conjuration was in order?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cupcake sized less than the spread of her palm appeared in Miffie's hands, dressed not unlike her first. Unwrapping the cup from the cake, Miffie devilishly devoured her treat for being such a good little mage. Begin able to conjure up her favorite treat at little less than will sure was handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she knew at the continuing grumbling of her belly that enough was enough (\"Uugh, I sound like Mother!\") She loved chocolate. <i>Loved</i> chocolate. But she also wasn't a fan of straining her wings trying to fly around a whopper of a Miffie. Mother had said that control was a big part of being a Mage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who said she couldn't cheat every now and then when it came to the whole \"control\" thing, anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie recalled the spell that her mother had taught her some days ago, having only tried it once or twice since then. She recited the words and focused herself just as her mother had instructed her to...</span></div></div>",

Her little stomach filled up like a water balloon on a high-pressure tap, and in the matter of seconds, she felt fuller than she'd ever been in her life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ook,\" she hiccuped, prodding her distended belly.   It was taut and quivering, and even bigger than it had been after her last cupcake pig-out.  This spell was certainly realistic.  She wondered what was <i>in</i> there.  Magical phantasms?  Mental illusions?  Whatever it was, it sure did feel real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe definitely didn't want to eat any more cupcakes.  Just the thought made her head spin and her poor overloaded stomach squeal in dismay.  <i>I guess it works</i>, she thought, <i>but gosh, does it have to work quite so </i>well?   Surely it would have been enough just to dull her cravings without stuffing her to the point of exploding!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"En-enough,\" she moaned.  Maybe this spell just wasn't made for a pixie's stomach -- she didn't see how she could accomplish anything like this.   She could barely even move.   Closing her eyes, she concentrated on manipulating the mystical variables which danced in front of her eyes.   Reverse that, and move that here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once she felt relief as her burstingly bloated stomach shriveled back down to normal.   <i>Phew!</i>   She ran her hands over her flat abdomen, and hitched up her skirt, which had begun to sag.  The waistband had been stretched out by what would have been two or three inches on a human.  It would have to be tightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, it almost felt good to be hungry, at least at first.  But soon, she was right back where she started, daydreaming of chocolate frosting and salivating with delight and anticipation.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No!</i>, she chided herself. <i> Stop it!  Remember how it felt to make a pig of yourself?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah, but you don't have to eat that much,</i> cooed Miffie's shoulder devil (which was practically microscopic, but very persuasive).  <i>Just a few.  Just take the edge off!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few cupcakes <i>did</i> sound <i>so</i> wonderful... but if she made a pig of herself, her mother would know, and she'd be disappointed.  <i>Again</i>.  And Miffie would probably never get to learn another spell, not even if she lived to be a million!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if her mother didn't need to know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if Miffie ate her fill and <i>then</i> blamed the inevitable bulge on Phantus Gustes?  Not only would she look responsible and continent, but she's get brownie points for practicing. <i>Which I already did it anyway so I definitely deserve them!</i>, she thought defiantly.  She couldn't do it all the time, of course.  Definitely not.  She'd get fat.  But just once... just today... just to bury those chocolate cravings alive under a thick layer of moist, crumbly cake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe created one cupcake, then another, then another, then another -- having your stomach stretched out and emptied like that could really sharpen your appetite!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kara returned home--</span></div></div>",

The poor girl had obviously stuffed herself with cupcakes and tried to cover it up with a transparent lie.  Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a sea of conflicting emotions wash over her face.  Relief -- <i>I fooled her! </i> Guilt -- <i>I'm lying to mother... </i> And a healthy dose of queasy apprehension -- <i>I'm going to have to eat</i> more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't show any signs of coming clean, though.  Kara sighed inwardly.  <i>Well, I'll give her the chance to admit it herself</i>, she decided.   Surely once a heavy plate of the sparkling, multicolored mushrooms were fried up and set before her, she would break down and confess her deception rather than glut herself further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie herself was biting her lip in desperation.  Perched on her special chair, she massaged her belly, trying to make a little room during this brief window while the food was cooking.   <i>I'll just have to find the room</i>, she told herself sternly.  <i>I can't let mother down again!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar sooner than she wished, a heaping saucer of steaming mushrooms was set before her.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this a -- a lot, mother?\" she said nervously.  \"I don't w-want to get fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a growing girl, and you need to eat <i>something</i>,\" Kara explained.  \"You may have felt full all day, but in reality, you haven't eaten a thing.\"  She looked at Miffie expectantly.  \"Right?\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nCome on Miffie, come clean!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Miffie just averted her eyes and picked up her fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll give her this</i>, Kara said to herself, laying her groaning daughter on the bed, <i>she's a determined little thing</i>.  She had been sure that Miffie would give up; if not during the first plate, then surely she should have snapped when Kara ladled a second helping in front of her!  And yet the poor girl had maintained the deception, eating and eating until every speck was gone and her stomach was so distended that Kara was afraid to offer her thirds, fearing the girl might actually burst before admitting her wrongdoing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiled sadly and pulled the covers up over the sleeping girl.   Miffie moaned, gurgled, and turned to her side.  <i>Poor thing was so scared she would disappoint me again</i>, she thought.  Well, gorging herself into such an uncomfortably overstuffed state was punishment enough.  Kara wouldn't mention it again, and hopefully Miffie would learn her lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Miffie awoke, stretched, and let out a couple of cute little burps.   She still felt rather stuffed, and had no desire to eat breakfast, but at least she wasn't so full she could scarcely breathe.  She never wanted to eat that much again!    <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nEspecially,</i> she sighed, looking herself over in the pearl-handled hand mirror which served her as a full-length dressing mirror, <i>because it's making me puffy!</i>   She prodded herself, feeling soft and squishy all over.   She hoped it was just her imagination -- who <i>wouldn't</i> feel fat, after last night? -- but the tightness of her favorite tiger-lily skirt told her otherwise.   She sighed.

She had really overdone it last night, hadn't she? Mischief was natural, very much like a second nature to Pixie-kind, but lying was far from natural. In fact, Miffie had never really lied to her mother before, especially over something as silly as having snacked before suppertime. Perhaps she could come clean and <i>that</i> would ease the throbbing pain in her belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes traveled back to the handmirror, focusing peculiarly on her somewhat still-distended middle. After having eaten so much last night, and being as small as she was, it was only natural that everything would be a little bloated. Mother hadn't exactly proportioned supper to \"Miffie-sized\". Thankfully, she was still full. Not Phantus Gustus full, but full all the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miffie!\" her mother's voice came from the kitchen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon her parental beckoning, the tiny girl instinctively fluttered upwards from the nightstand, stealing one last glance at herself to make sure her long blue locks were parted correctly. Finding it hard to smile at herself, still plagued by the queasiness towards her betrayal (or, maybe that was just indigestion) Miffie let out a puff of air and shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming, Mother!\" she cried out in an attempt to seem her usual self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie, clad in tiger lily, flapped quietly into the room. Where her entrances were usually a spectacle (often getting so excited at another day of mentoring magic that she would fly straight into the furniture) this morning Miffie was quiet and seemed sullen. Feeling heavy with sadness and overindulgence, Kara's tiny ward sat down on the dinner table with her legs crossed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called?\" she asked in a poor imitation of her usual chipper tone, not wanting to hint that she was plagued by inner feelings of treason to her poor doting mother. Kara turned from the counter to face her daughter, her gentle matronly smile bound between what were either dimples or \"sophistication lines\" (as she preferred to call them). As always she knelt down and gave her daughter a big kiss, well everything was big to Miffie, on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my little Sugarplum.\" she said sweetly, \"Are you excited for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid sugarplum smiled awkwardly at the question, \"Um... of course I am!\" her pitch deceptively so with a wiggle of her antennae, \"The Magic Tournament begins today and I get to go watch. I thought that's what last night was for... aren't you judging again this year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiled knowingly, a glimmer of excitement in her wise gray eyes. \"Actually Miffie, I won't be judging this year.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie was more than a little confused now. Her mother wasn't going to be judging this year, which was fine of course, but she always seemed so excited about doing it. Something about \"seeing the next generation of mages, witches, and wizards at their start\" or whatever it was her mother said at the opening every year. Why did she seem so happy? Was this a punishment- was she not going to get to go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're not?\" Miffie tiptoed, raising to her feet, \"So... then what was--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--That was your celebratory meal, Miffie!\" her mother said wryly, \"After all, how are you supposed to participate in the Young Apprentice's Magic Tournament on an empty stomach?\" In all actuality, of course, that was only half true. That was the intention of the meal last night, but Kara admitted inwardly that it was mostly about Miffie's lying. But whatever, a moment's a moment. She had long forgiven her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What?\" Miffie asked, her wings shimmering with a faint blue glow as her antennae perked up, \"P-Participate?\" she parroted stupidly, as if her mother was speaking Ogrish<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Kara smiled warmly, \"And the prize is--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And surely last year the only young mages hadn't been quite so... fierce looking.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nThey look like a bunch of killers</i>, Miffie thought nervously.   There was a serious-looking girl dressed all in black, her face criss-crossed with tattooed runes.  A young half-elven man in the dandified clothes of a noble polished an expensive-looking mahogany wand, surrounded by stoic retainers.  A crafty-looking goblin girl fingered one of the potion flasks in the bandolier around her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can she even bring those?\" Miffie asked, pointing out the goblin.  \"That <i>can't</i> be allowed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as she brewed them herself, it's fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh.

The truth was, after seeing her competition, she almost wanted to turn around and fly home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All competitors, to the starting area!\" boomed a magically amplified voice.  Hesitantly, she followed the others into a low bunker at the edge of the field.  She turned to see her mother waving and blowing her a kiss, and then the heavy iron door slid down in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look what we got here,\" the goblin girl smirked as soon as the sound of the crowd cut off.  \"A little flyin' baby.  A <i>fat</i> little flyin' baby, at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the assembled mages snickered.  The half-elf dandy yawned.  \"My, they're letting just about everyone in this year, aren't they?

Simplicity was apparently the motto for this year's competition. The judges, all of them hooded, were hovering all around the edge of the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow them, crowding round, were the spectators, chairs provided by the local mage's guild, Kara seated in the chair closest to the arena, her eyes taking in every last bit of the ground where her daughter would be displaying her abilities to the representatives of the known magical world. Her heart went out to the pixie bravely staring down some of the other apprentices, her gaze locked on her daughter, when a hand suddenly found her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you still cling to that tiny mote-of-nothing, legendary hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara glared at the hand and it removed itself, shaking just a little. \"Methos, what brings you all the way out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apprentice,\" Methos said, her voice sibilant and husky.

I taught you that, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMethos's red eyes bored into her then and she huffed. \"You only taught me weakness.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sky above was a pristine cloudless blue expanse which loomed overhead heavily, as if it too was engrossed in the two competitors that stood below and was on the edge of its seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the right hand, the Elven dandy from before stood at attention, facing his first opponent sternly and without break in concentration. His stance was strong, ready to swish-and-flick his wand at a moment's notice. While he was considerably taller than most Elves, he was certainly just as lean and wiry as any other member of his kin. Once he had stripped most of the fine linen outfit he had appeared in and embroidered leather overcoat, everyone could see that he was just toned enough for intimidation, though slender enough to show that physical attempts at violence were clearly not his forte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light bounced off of his pale yellow skin, the outline of his proud elvish nose clearly visible in his shadow on the stone floor below him, as he clearly eyed the mysterious girl he was to face in hopes of catching some weak spots in her perfectly erect stance. When he couldn't find any, no doubt he comforted himself with how much richer than her his family was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertainly she looked to have come into some money at some point, at least enough to fund her personal sense of fashion. Her pale gray skin was tattooed with, by the looks of it, a blood red ink that made up intricate runes. She was covered in a long black cloak, drawn to cover her shoulders and plexus, but left the remainder of her torso and legs exposed. That being said, however, she looked to be dressed in thick black pants that would certainly have been murder if the day hadn't been so cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the strange woman in the crowd, the mysterious girl's eyes seemed to flash a dark red underneath her hood. And not unlike her opponent, the heated stare of those red eyes seemed fixed on an opponent. Though not the dapper young gentleman across from her, no... Miffie could have sworn that those creepy peepers were looking directly at her in the sidelines!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two of them, a stone statue vaguely resembling a human in shape, held up a flag proudly. Though the crowd was antsy and the tension cuttable with even the dullest of cutlery, that which was to act as referee and starting signal for the tournament would not move. His arm raised high in the air, red flag flapping gently in the slight breeze, he waited uncaringly for the official signal to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above the actual arena, in a stone viewing gallery that rested over the stadium's pews, three arcane masters sat and kept the audience waiting on their sign of approval that the games could begin. Two of them men, one ridiculously bearded human and an ogre with a slight pituitary, and one of them a woman, an elvish monarch called last-second for a token female judge upon Kara's announcement that she would only be spectating this year. They whispered amongst themselves for a moment as they watched the atmosphere below thicken and swirl with anxiety. This would set the bar for all other duels that were to commence today... though, by the looks of the contestants already present, things were sure to get interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Runes? Do we still allow those?\" the man turned to face his fellow viewers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if they're tribal.\" the Ogre grunted as he gnashed on a turkey's leg, \"We used to ban 'em back in the Goldveil Shaman and Magecraft games. Think we should say somethin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, allow the girl to play the game.\" came the sweet sophisticated input of the elf, \"I think they're... pretty.\" she settled to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight pause between the two men as they turned to face each other. \"Women. Pheh.\" the Mage rolled his eyes, \"These young scholars are here to blow each other up, not accessorize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose if she applied them herself then it's allowed.\" Came the turkey-speckled splatter of the Ogre's input as his greasy green mitts pawed at the official rulebook for the tournament, \"We let in potions and enchanted weapons all the time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grown man huffed, \"Fine, but I don't like it.\" he pouted like a child eight hundred years his junior. He snapped, and a blue flame sparked over the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statue's arm fell suddenly and the competitors came to life! The Dapper Dandy on the right armed with his wand, aglow a silvery hue with his magical energies, as the Mysterious Mage on the left's hands began to glow a murderous red, energy wrapping around her fingers and settling into the shape of bladed knuckles. Conjuration spells <i>were</i> her specialty indeed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie could only blink as that uneasy feeling in her stomach came back once more. She watched as the Elf gallantly (or, as gallantly as a snooty jerk like him could get) faced against his opponent. For some reason... maybe it was the murderous death glares... she couldn't help but not like that girl. Even as she weaved and dodged the boy's firebolts and even managed to cut every piece of enchanted arrow that was thrown her way, she never missed a single beat. Her movements were fluid, absolute liquid as she danced her way closer to the dreadful snob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused after looking into her eyes, taking a second too long to analyze the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer conjured knife was in his back before he knew what hit him... and then he did, once the Death-Ward took place. But still, he had lost. If this had happened outside the arena walls, he would have been dead... and she had only used one spell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why was Little-Miss-Sunshine busy staring daggers at Miffie, and not her should-be-dead opponent?</span></div></div>",

The goblin's bone armor were obviously taken from several kobolds and the yellow-white color of the bones clashed with the goblin's lime-green skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna melt your little wings off, bug!\" the goblin crowed, a potion flying Miffie's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodging, Miffie prepared an energy blast only to be caught of guard as a column of smoke blinded her, the wisps of smoke soon becoming a large cobra, with bared fangs. Flying upwards, she unleashed the blast she had intended for her foe and dissipated the conjured apparition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie was about to fly higher when she felt those red eyes from the hooded young woman on her, the recognition of that piercing glare freezing her for a split second. A moment that sent Miffie tumbling to the ground, bound to the grey slate of an arena by a yellowish goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wings were helpless against the strength of the goo and what's worse, she could feel the stuff pressing against her body slowly, sure to crush her if she allowed things to remain as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands coated in the stuff, as well as most of her body save for her face and bits of her wings, Miffie concentrated on her magical energy, rerouting it from her hands to her eyes, beams of eldritch light shooting out and searing through her bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow free, the crowd eerily silent, Miffie smirked as she tapped her cheering foe on the shoulder, the goblin whirling around and gaping at her suddenly freed enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before the goblin could strike, Miffie used her newest spell, the goblin on her back and belching mightily, groaning as her middle bulged outwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping her fingers on the stone in the symbol of surrender, the crowd cheered as Miffie was announced the victor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out to her mother, Miffie beamed as Kara smiled the largest smile Miffie could recall seeing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon back on the benches, Miffie was elated until she felt those red eyes again, cutting through her joy. Shivering, Miffie tried her best to ignore that red glare but found it hovering on the edge of her mind, even as the tournament continued.</span></div></div>",

She glanced over at her tiny daughters opponent - the apprentice of her former student. Kara couldn't help but grimace at the sight of the black-cloaked girl standing stock-still across from her pixie protege. The enigmatic competitor had proved her power against her other opponents - and though she knew little Miffie had enough magic flowing through her veins to rival anyone, she wasn't sure if Miffie had enough knowledge of offensive magic to stand much of a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perhaps I should have at least reviewed the basic elemental attacks...</i> she thought wistfully. <i>Oh, well. She'll do her best. And who knows - my Miffie is always full of surprises!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie felt a cold dread wash over her as she hovered uncertainly over the starting position. She suddenly thought it ridiculous that she had ever been excited in any way about entering this dumb tournament. She wasn't ready for this! She couldn't even remember the basic elemental attacks! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance at her opponent provided Miffie with nothing but a eyeful of that hate-filled glare that seemed to have been on her the whole tournament. Miffie shivered, and adjusted her skirt. She could feel the remnants of last nights massive meal burbling around in her bloated little tummy, and she was beginning to feel a bit nauseous - mostly nerves, but her still full belly probably didn't help the matter. <i>Wow, I really overdid it last night...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie was suddenly snapped out of her thoughts by an enthusiastic roar from the crowd of spectators. She looked around, confused for a moment, before catching sight of the stone statue with it's flag lowered. The match had started!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught totally unawares and distinctly lacking in the 'plan' department, Miffie gazed helplessly as her amber-eyed foe began chanting some incantations under her breath. The little pixie, having no idea what to expect, began desperately muttering the appropriate verses to a shielding charm - well, the verses she could remember, anyways. Her nervous nausea was suddenly replaced by unbridled fear as the protective bubble she was supposed to be encasing herself in failed to materialize. Across the field, her rival continued chanting as a purple orb of energy began to form around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie was filled with horror as she finished her half-improvised charm - which had done nothing but tinge the air around her a sickly yellow color - and continued to watch the incredibly long spell that was taking place across from her. Miffie became terribly aware of the crowd's ooh-ing and ahh-ing at the sight of the glowing purple orb that had now surrounded her foe, and she could have sworn she hear Kara shouting something terribly impolite. Though she was sure it wasn't really her mother, (Kara never would say those naughty words!) the crushing thought that she was going to let her mother down <i>again</i> pressed down on Miffie. As she braced herself from whatever terrible thing was going to come from that sphere, Miffie wondered if Kara would forgive her. She couldn't even preform a simple shield charm correctly! She was a disgrace to all pixie-kind! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned to these thoughts, she closed her eyes and instinctively shielded her face with her tiny arms as a beam of light shot from the ball, flying directly at her -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie felt the air begin to vibrate violently around her as a gasp emanated from the stands. She waited, not wanting to see what was happening to her. Probably something extraordinarily terrible. The air continued to vibrate, making her tiny little ears pop. She continued to hold her position, shutting her eyes even tighter, waiting for some sort of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the vibrations stopped. A wild cheer from the crowd nearly drowned out an exhausted, indignant cry from the apprentice across the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering all of her courage, Miffie cracked open her eyes and peeped over her arm. She saw the now aura-less figure standing across from her, panting, eyes staring metaphorical daggers into Miffies very soul. Completely removing her arm from over her eyes, Miffie saw with wonder that she was now fully encased in a brownish-yellow bubble, sparks of purple energy still dancing over its surface. Slowly, the impromptu shield faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Did I... did I just block that?</i> Miffie thought with amazement. <i>But I just made up half of the charm!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the field, the cloaked girl was screaming at her between pants. \"That's not possible! That is completely impossible!\" her eyes flared crimson, and her tattoos seemed even more menacing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie, with a sudden surge of confidence, tried her best to steel her face, deciding that what worked before would work again. She closed her eyes, manipulating the correct magical variables, and suddenly - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaah!\" the girl screamed in surprise as her stomach filled with Phantus Gustes. Miffie opened her eyes, smiling at the sight of her opponent knocked to the ground by her sudden expansion. She could do this! There was no way to fight when you were in that condition - Miffie would know! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffies new-found confidence was instantly swept away, however, when with an incantation and a flick of the wrist, her foe was back to her average size - and looking ready to kill, having been humiliated in such a way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie felt it even as she saw those red eyes close - a tingling sensation all over her body. Quickly, the tingling grew more intense, becoming painful. Suddenly, Miffies tiny body was wracked with pain - her wings gave out and she tumbled to the ground, feeling like she was being stabbed by a thousand needles. All she wanted to do was black out, to lose consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a sound like an explosion was heard, and the pain stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara stormed onto the field, the three members of the judging panel trailing behind her. The bearded old human was shouting at the top of his lungs, \"I knew it! I told you! 'Those runes are a bad thing,' I said! But did you listen?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female elf was looking worriedly at the tattooed competitor whom Kara had just sent halfway across the stadium. \"Oh, dear, is she going to be alright? I feel as though that was a tad bit excessive, that Air Pulse was completely unnecessary...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old ogre just waved his chicken thigh. \"Ah, she'll be fine. Death ward'll make sure o' it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara just walked on, her face contorted with anger. How dare somebody use those spells? On her daughter! To think that that filthy bitch was teaching her student those things make her shiver in her core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon had her tiny daughter cradled in one hand. Miffie was awake, if not a little woozy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-did I lose, mother? I-I'm so sorry...\" she stuttered out. Kara's heart melted. After what had just happened, she was worried about impressing her. Kara felt another surge of hate for the girl she had just blasted halfway to the Northern Woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Miffie. You didn't lose. You won.\" she said it proudly, haughtily. \"I knew you could do it all along.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie looked confused. \"But - there's no way I won. I didn't do anything. She got me with that - that spell.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiled grimly. \"MIffie, you won because neither of the spells she used were legal. The first was an incredibly advanced magic - resulting in elimination. The second was <i>Phantus Dolor.</i> It is another Mirage of the Mind - the reason they are sometimes called 'dark magic'. While <i>Phantus Gustes</i> tricks you into believing you are full, this one... well, you know what it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie nodded sagely. \"So I win? I get the ring?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiled. \"You betcha.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie, beginning to regain her composure, stood up in Kara's palm. She tentatively fluttered off of her mothers hand, testing her wings. Finding them in full working order, she fluttered up to Karas shoulder and perched on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning into her ear, she whispered, \"So, does this mean I get to choose what's for dinner?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara just laughed.</span></div></div>",

Pastries, roast duck, a suckling pig with an apple in it's mouth, and of course cupcakes, all sprang into being along with more food, most of it fattening, sweet, or a combination of the two. Kara could do nothing but chuckle at her daughter's choice of fare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the wooden table was groaning from the weight of all that food, Miffie opened her eyes and grabbed the closest item, a chunk of pie, and devoured it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Mom,\" Miffie said with her mouth full of food. \"Eat up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara nodded, deciding that for just this night, she could allow Miffie to drop some of the manners she'd instilled in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a large slice of ham, a few cookies, and a mug of hot chocolate, Kara began to eat, cheeks gorged with the amount of food in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie watched, eyes widening even as she swallowed that first chunk of cupcake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara blushed and swiftly finished the first plate, belching loudly. \"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie just giggled and filled her mother's plate again with cupcakes and more sweets before piling her own plate high with roast pig, a few cookies, and several slices of venison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet I can eat more than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't have to be a competition honey,\" Kara replied, but just shrugged her shoulders as she watched her daughter's gluttony, the famous mage soon starting to stuff herself as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                                       </span></div></div>",

Her daughters own celebratory meal had been delicious, and nearly perfectly done - well, except for the duck, which had been nearly uncooked. But Kara had fixed that up without Miffie noticing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara sighed again, and stifled a little burp. Given the occasion, she had let herself go a tad - but had stopped as soon as she had noticed that her daughter <i>actually</i> seemed to have it in mind to eat more than her. The thought was absolutely ridiculous, given that Miffie stood at most twelve inches tall on her tippy-toes, but that didn\u2019t mean she hadn\u2019t tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch that - that didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t still trying. Miffie, caught up in the joy of winning the tournament, had completely forgotten her dietary woes of earlier that morning. She had fallen on her self-made feast like a dwarf on to a finely-aged ale. First, she had to try everything she had created, just to make sure it had come out alright. Then, she needed seconds, to make sure the middles were well-done. Finally, a third round of her favorites needed to be Miffi-sized and packed away -  just because she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the little pixie seemed oddly immune to the effects of her meal - seated at her own miniature table, she slouched back in her tiny chair, admiring a heavily-frosted (Miffi-sized) cupcake with eyes full of desire. After a moment of admiring her creation she popped the entire thing in her mouth, her cheeks bulging out cutely as she chewed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smirked as Miffie expertly floated a chocolate chip cookie as big as herself to her table and shrunk it to a devourable size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara looked at Miffies frosting-stained cheeks, her her chocolate-smeared fingers - and most importantly, her heavily bloated tummy. It strained against her leafy green top, poking at least three-quarters of an inch into Miffies tiny lap. To Kara, it looked like yet another terrible belly-ache waiting to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019ll probably regret that cookie later.\u201d Kara said as Miffie lifted the goodie to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cookie stopped mid-flight as its captor paused to examine it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea, probably.\u201d Miffie said, before popping it into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara chuckled at the pixies undeniably lacking logical skills. She decided now was the time to talk about the tournament, if just to stop Miffie from stuffing herself any farther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Miffie,\u201d she began, as the girl began to eye one of the few surviving cupcakes, \u201cJust what was that shield charm you casted in the last match? I know I sure didn\u2019t teach it to you - in fact, I\u2019ve never seen it before in my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie blushed as she turned her eyes from the snack to her mother. \u201cUh... well...  I kinda made it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara looked at her in disbelief. \u201cYou made a charm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-well no,\u201d Miffie corrected herself hastily. \u201cI had one in mind, but I sorta forgot some of the words, and I just... made some up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara shook her head. \u201cYour lucky. You could have seriously injured yourself. Don\u2019t ever do that again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry mother.\u201d Miffie mumbled. She felt bad - her mother had warned her constantly of performing a piece of magic she didn\u2019t know well. She looked for a quick change of the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo mother... I saw you talking to a lady in the stands. Was that a friend? Why haven't I ever met her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie felt her mother tense up, immediately realizing that the change in subject had probably been a bad one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiffie...\u201d Kara said, in that tone only a parent could take, \u201cbefore I found you, I had... other apprentices.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie was shocked. \u201cYou had other kids...?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve never adopted any but you as my own.\u201d Kara was quick to point out. \u201cThese students of magic came to me, seeking my guidance. Now, the woman I was talking to is named Methos. She was my apprentice quite a while ago. She immediately showed great potential to become a powerful mage, and I taught her at a rapid pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara moved her gaze from her daughter to the window. \u201cBut Methos soon was bored by simple spells. She began to read on her own, practice late at night. I didn\u2019t know that she was learning spells far beyond her experience level. She began to think of herself as a prodigy, a one-of-a-kind, and thought I was holding her back. One day, she came down to breakfast, stunned me as I cooked her pancakes, and left. She\u2019s been snooping around here for years now, causing trouble. This was the first time I\u2019ve actually spoke with her since she left me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara turned back to her daughter, smiling wryly. \u201cShe\u2019s a bad nut, Miff. Just try to forget about her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara didn\u2019t exactly have to worry about that. She had to work hard to keep her \u2018serious face\u2019 up as she looked at Miffie, who was slouched so far into her seat she was nearly laying on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the pixies stomach had finally realized that the abuse had to stop sometime during Karas nostalgic rant, and poor Miffie was just now feeling the full effects of her most recent culinary conquest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh - *hic* - wha?\u201d Miffie mumbled as she snapped back to reality, adjusting her golden \u2018crown\u2019 with one hand, rubbing her overfilled stomach with the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Kara gave up the serious face, and broke into a wide grin. \u201cOh, nothing important. Soo...\u201d her grin grew a tad bit mischievous, \u201cYou want another cupcake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie moaned. \u201cOhhhh, mother, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna eat another cupcake in my life.\u201d and after a cute little belch, added, \u201cOr anything else, for that matter...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Miff, you\u2019re such a terrible liar.\u201d Kara chuckled as she gently scooped her suffering daughter into her hand. \u201cC\u2019mon, you need some rest. It\u2019s been a long day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, mother, take it easy.\u201d Miffie said, clutching her groaning middle as she lay in her mother\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Miffie was fast asleep, her tired tummy left with the task of finding somewhere to put her massive meal. Kara looked at her sleeping daughter with pride. She looked at her pointer finger, where her own ring she won from her first Young Apprentices Tournament sat - an exact replica of Miffies. Then again, she hadn\u2019t eaten her weight in foodstuffs afterwards... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a silent chuckle, Kara turned out the lights, and went to clean the dishes. </span></div></div>",

It had always amused Kara that her daughter tried to consume so much. Even as a toddler, even before her first word, Kara had been witness to Miffie glutting herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning dear,\" Kara said, Miffie nodding and plopping down on the table, which creaked just the tiniest bit. \"What did you want for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about two pancakes, human-sized if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human-sized? Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie nodded, eyes more alert as she patted her stomach. \"Yeah. I figure I can let myself go a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You figure hmm? Well you are no longer a child, honey, and if you do want to let yourself go, I certainly won't stop you. But I want you to be healthy, so after you eat, we'll go take a nice stroll around town, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie nodded at that, beaming as Kara set down two pancakes down before her, each one large enough to serve as a blanket for the pixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed, while eating, that Kara's own plate was filled more than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...why are you eating more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The life of a mage, at least one as prolific as the enigmatic Kara, was one filled with modest pleasures and simple joys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all one has to do is spout an enchantment or write up a spell, after some time a certain yearning for hard labor and the sweat on one's brow is developed. Kara was always one for preaching similar values, and the activities that made up her daily life usually reflected as such. Instead of casting a Dirt Ward over her humble cottage, she would take the time to clean it up herself. Rather than store supplies in an interdimensional pocket outside of time and space, Kara practiced the art of \"Spring Cleaning\" to rid her home of things no longer required. And instead of conjuring up food from nowhere(as her daughter had become so versed in) Kara preferred going to the market and actually paying for goods and services.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweeping, however, was something a little more menial that she felt could be done in the background by someone other than herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for free, since she had all of the necessary tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was busy preparing the night's supper, chopping up souroot on the cutting table, her ever-faithful and as of now enchanted broom had been instructed to sweep himself around the kitchen, pushing whatever was to be found in the also enchanted dustpan and then thrown out the non-sentient window. Because that would be weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara's tone was jovial as she lightly hummed the score of a song she had heard recently in town, a traveling bard had regaled the other taverners with a musical tale about a faraway king slaying an evil dragon (or something, he wasn't a very good bard.) An earnest smile across her face as she enjoyed the fruits of her labor. Her faith was bolstered, as she had been told in the youth of her studies, she was sure that her sweat and toil would show in the quality of the stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with the last stalk, Kara scooped up the dark green pieces of root and plopped them collectively into the nearby pot. She would then move onto the dwarvesbane and swampbuddle, chopping the bane and peeling the bud, before fetching some water. If Miffie would arrive home with the hogmeat, they could enjoy supper within three hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malachi, be a dear and go get that, would you?\" Kara instructed her broom, her response a mute conferrence from the wooden bristly servant before it swept its way over to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wedged the tip of its shaft into the handle of the door and pulled backwards, allowing the heavy oaken port to open slowly. It was a broom, and therefore not very well versed in anything that didn't involving brooming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara lifted her gaze from the table, her pace with the knife slowing as she did so, to see quite the familiar sight:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Archie?\" she asked aloud to the aged man standing in her doorway, \"Is that really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, 'tis.\" the decrepit gentleman said with a smile behind graying whiskers, \"Mind if an ol' student stopped by?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course!\" Kara said warmly, dropping her knife on the table as she ushered in her former student<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArchemedes Helgason, or as all those whom had deemed his name too \"formal\" or \"strict\" had come to know him as \"Archie\", was a short drink of water. He was a human, with dwarven blood somewhere by the looks of him, with a curly mop of brown hair that was beginning to fade in his old age. He had come to Kara some thirty years ago in pursuit of a love potion, having heard of her prolific powers in potionry. She accepted, with the usual hoo-ha about responsibility and whatnot which Archie promptly ignored, and was not surprised when the little fellow was back a week later asking how to reverse the effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then Archie had been a welcome guest in Kara's humble home. He lived a bit of a walk's way away, in Davenport, so his visits were scarce. But over the years Kara had watched him grow into a wonderful man. She was present at his wedding, to a stout woman with large knockers, and was always eager to help him through any problem she could (frequent loans and magical \"favors\" being the most common, though she didn't mind the former as much as the latter). He had grown even shorter and quite round in his elder years, though she could still place his boistrous laugh and rosy red cheeks even behind his shaggy beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe would-be dwarf lumbered over to the dining room table and groaned as he sat down, patting his beer belly. \"Got any ale, then?\" he asked with a smile, \"If ya don't mind that is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" Kara answered kindly as she levitated the bottle from its setting (far from Miffie's reach). Normally she would have gotten it herself, but she could tell by the amazed twinkle in Archie's eyes that he was still very amazed by even the simplest of tricks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya really oughtta teach me that one 'a these days.\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been trying to teach you how to pull a gold piece from behind your ear for the past three decades,\" Kara joked as she pulled up a seat across from her former student, \"I think that levitation might have to wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArchie laughed, his belly shaking like gelatine, \"You really are a quick one, you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiled, it was always nice to hear that every now and then. In return, she wriggled her finger and instructed the bottle to pour directly into a conjured cup. Archie was giddy with excitement, clapping his callused hands together like a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookee that!\" he shouted in utter amazement \"Oh Teach, you are somethin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiled, \"Well when you've been doing this for as long as I have, it gets a little old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArchie grabbed the glass with his large hands and lifted it high above his nose. The ale trickled down into his whiskers and onto his shirt. When the glass hit the table with a loud rattling sound, it was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Archie, how are you?\" Kara asked in a manner remincient of a mother who's child never calls, \"I only see you... what, couple of years or so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, 'm fine.\" he said with a wave of his hand, \"The wife's gettin' old on me, gettin' fat too. But Gods so am I.\" he said with a laugh, \"Ulter's goin' to work as a smith, a boy after me own heart. Flannery's gettin' married an'... well damn, I've got ten of 'em! Ya can't expect me ta keep track of all of 'em!\" he topped off his rant with another boistrous laugh that shook the whole house<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm happy to hear it.\" Kara said kindly, \"Its nice to know that one of my worst students has done so well with his life. Congratulations on having such a big family, Archie.\" Kara said with a delicate sip of her own glass (substantially smaller that her guest's)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Archie's face grew dour from behind his mud brown beard. \"Well, not all is well at the Helgason home. Y'see, me youngest son Laughen... we found him dead in the prarie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... it looked downright unnatural the way he died. His insides were all over the place. His belly had burst. Strangest thing, poor kid hadn't eaten for hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara's eyes widened slightly at the description of Laughen. She remembered seeing the boy early in his years, he couldn't have been more than twelve by the time of death. Of course, her sentiments were genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no Teach, t'ain't your fault.\" he said with a sad smile, \"But I was wonderin'... wonderin' if you'd come back to Davenport with me? Help figger out what's goin' on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going on, whatever do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'see, my boy ain't the first one'ta be found like that. All blown up. Lotsa people about town are startin'ta worry. Not go outside anymore, whisperin' about'a curse or somethin', I dunno. I know better, I know its magic- but it t'aint no curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what do you want me to do about it?\" Kara asked, \"I'll admit, it doesn't sound much like a curse to me, but it does sound like something... forbidden. Even as far as I'm concerned. It sounds like something from the Phantus order of spells, my Miffie was recently exposed to something very much like what you're describing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry ta hear that... I know how much you loved the little bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Miffie was lucky, she had been Death-Warded- it was in a competition not but two weeks ago. Still, I'll do whatever I can to help you. When do we leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking as soon as possible. Get a good night's sleep, a hot meal, and head out. If we leave tomorrow morning, we should get there by sundown by wagon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good...\" Kara said sternly, \"I'll just put a hold on this stew for later, the ingredients should still be good if I chill them--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on!\" Archie said, his former self returning to him as a smile creased his lips, \"Just 'cos we're gettin' all serious doesn't mean I'm gonna pass up som'ma yer Hogsmeat Stew! When do we eat?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara smiled, \"As soon as Miffie gets back with the meat.\"</span></div></div>",

The kitchen soon filled with the rich scent of pork, and everyone's mouth was watering.  Miffie fluttered eagerly around the pot, inhaling the succulent aroma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miffie,\" Kara said, clearing her throat.  \"I need to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I only bought one!\"  Miffie said guiltily.  \"I had some change and they looked so good and I knew it was a while until dinner--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not about that.

It was true that Miffie had never been on a quest of this caliber before, or any caliber for that matter. The young pixie\u2019s life of homestuck studying would have to come to an end at some point or another; why not let her first experience out in the world be a safe one with her mother and mentor by her side? However the description of Laughen\u2019s body echoed from the back of her mind, all burst and bloodied in the field, reaffirming her stance on Miffie\u2019s attendance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what happened at the tournament\u2026. Seeing Miffie like that again would be too much, considering that the next time she wouldn\u2019t be getting back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe that as it may, Miffie, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite ready enough to come along.\u201d Kara said sternly as she placed her little girl down on the table delicately, \u201cI promise when you\u2019re ready I\u2019ll show you everything you need to know, but not this time. Not yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie\u2019s pretty jaw dropped as she struggled to find the words to speak, \u201cB-B-But the ring, I\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiffie, that\u2019s enough.\u201d Kara cut her off with a raised pointer finger, \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl, and I know you just want to help, but I don\u2019t want to see your insides strewn about like that ever again\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy insides\u2026?\u201d Miffie repeated to herself, \u201cMother, if this is about what happened at the tournament, I\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough, Miffie, I\u2019ve told you too much.\u201d Kara seemed to be getting agitated now, her pretty brow furrowed slightly and the many hairs on Archie\u2019s arms standing on end, \u201cGo to your room, I\u2019ll call you when supper\u2019s ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie opened her mouth one more time, perhaps hoping to say something that might have changed her mother\u2019s mind, but decided against it after getting a stern glaring from both adults in the room. Instead she simply struggled to flutter upwards and down the hall, towards her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026\u201d she grumbled as she sulked away, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tiny mumble, Miffie\u2019s door opened magically (she was far too small to push it open herself) and shut just the same with a loud slam. The two remaining in the dining room were silent for a moment, completely understanding the perils of parenthood without uttering a word to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry about that.\u201d Kara turned back to Archie as she refilled his glass, \u201cShe\u2019s a good girl, and she really does have everyone\u2019s best interests at heart\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you don\u2019t hafta tell me twice.\u201d Archie said sympathetically, \u201cMiff\u2019s a sweetheart after yer own, Teach. I jus\u2019 wish I could handle me own girls as well as you do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes well, sometimes I wonder if I\u2019m not coddling her too much.\u201d Kara said, sounding rather defeated herself, \u201cI should really do something nice for her once we get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT\u2019aint nothin\u2019 to it.\u201d Archie said dismissively, \u201cIf your Miffie\u2019s anything like my youngins, she\u2019ll have forgotten about this whole thing by suppertime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie\u2019s room was far too big for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had actually belonged to the other apprentices that Kara had taken in before her; meaning that the mysterious woman from the tournament, Methos, as well as Archie had slept in her same room at some point in time. Since the bed set out for them was like an entire pasture for puny pixie, Kara had the foresight to set up a Miffie-sized mock bedroom on top of the dresser to make her feel more at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, she sat there with her knees brought up to her elbows and sulked, tiny tears rolling down her cheeks. Miffie was never a fan of getting yelled at, especially in front of company, but she didn\u2019t quite understand why it was that her mother was so afraid of her going on this trip! She had proven herself very capable; her ring, currently crowning doll\u2019s head that rested on her tiny desk to act as a mannequin, was surely a testament to that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there for a while before hearing the familiar \u2018click-clack\u2019 of her mother\u2019s shoes. She pushed the door open with one hand, for the other was carrying a small bowl (big enough to sate Miffie\u2019s ever-expanding appetite) between her forefinger and thumb as well as a small pitcher filled with water and a thimble for a cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiffie, darling?\u201d she said quietly, \u201cI\u2019ve brought you supper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie took a minute before answering, \u201cNo thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh honestly honey, you have to eat.\u201d She delicately placed the components of Miffie\u2019s supper on the dresser, \u201cNow I realize you\u2019re upset with me, but understand that you cannot go with me tomorrow. If not for your own safety, then for the sake of me not worrying myself gray-haired and into lunacy.\u201d She pleaded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d Miffie said with a bit of a pout<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould that have anything to do with the ring of blue frosting around your mouth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-M-Mother!!\u201d Miffie\u2019s face exploded in bright red, quickly licking and wiping the space around her lips, \u201cH-How did you\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Kara said slyly, \u201cYou don\u2019t have anything on your face at all, my dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-That wasn\u2019t funny, I\u2014\u201c Miffie started as she rose to face her mother, only to slump her shoulders, \u201cI just want to help! I want to help you and Mr. Archie, and I want to help all of his kids! I want to get out of this house, just for a little while!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiffie, no.\u201d Kara said strictly before bending down to kiss her daughter on the forehead, \u201cI am going tomorrow and you will stay here until I get back and that\u2019s that. Mr. Archie is outside loading up the wagon for the trip, I\u2019m leaving you with enough food to last the week. You\u2019ll be fine by yourself.\u201d She said, completely dismissing the conflict between them, \u201cDo your chores, study while I\u2019m gone, and make sure\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake sure that the neighbor girls get their quart of milk. Got it.\u201d Miffie said with a sad smile, \u201cI\u2019ll be good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sweetie\u2026\u201d Kara said with another kiss on what was supposed to be Miffie\u2019s forehead but wound up encompassing the entirety of her blue locks, \u201cYou\u2019re always good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you, Mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too, sweetheart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kara started towards the doorway, she turned back around, \u201cOh, and Mr. Archie\u2019s going to be sleeping in that bed tonight so\u2026 good luck with that.\u201d She added with a mischievous giggle fit for a girl far younger than her advanced age<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMOTHER!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight, just outside Kara\u2019s cottage. The wagon was boarded and the horses secured within a temporary stable conjured up just for the occasion of unexpected equine guests, at the great courtesy of Kara. In the darkness, a tiny shape is seen fluttering around impatiently, darting back and forth as if looking for\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta find a way, gotta find a way\u2026\u201d Miffie whispered to herself as she took several aerial paces to and from the wagon. The floorboards were solid, and to rip one up would be to jeopardize the structure of the whole thing. Her mother would surely see through any invisibility spell (if she knew any). She couldn\u2019t hide in the horses\u2019 manes because\u2026 well, horses were scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she noticed the shape of two sacks in the rear seat of the cart, certainly large enough for her to squeeze into! Miffie fluttered over and illuminated the area slightly with her aura, a light blue glow allowing her to see and untie the knot that fastened one of the sacks closed. When she had secured her soft shape in the confines of the burlap, she giggled mischievously and retied the knot magically from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely, Mother would understand a young mage\u2019s need for adventure every now and then? Even if it<i> was</i> against her wishes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh she would have the best time playing stowaway in the... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miffie settled her rump down on a comfortably juicy ham, cured and tied up with a string.  She looked around her at all the supplies the sack had to offer.  It was all food suited to travelling: salted meats, dried fruit, long-lasting vegetables, and dense lumps of hard bread that would last forever.  Still, it was well-made, and looked very tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled, reminding her that her dinner that night hadn't been particularly large.  Now she was hungry.  What if it happened again and  someone heard?  Obviously, she had to take care of it, and quick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe conjured a cupcake and quickly gobbled it down.  <i>Now be quiet, stomach!  Ah, and here we go,</i> she thought as she felt the wagon begin to move. <i> Finally I'm gonna get to see the world!  Adventure!  N' excitement!  The open road awaits!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie was bored out of her little pixie skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Uggggggh.  What's the point of being on the open road if you're stuck in a stupid sack?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to poke her head out and see what was going on.  But she didn't dare--her mother was out there!  She could get caught!  So she squatted in her sack,  bored.  And when Miffie got bored, she couldn't really help but eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first hour or so was dedicated to cupcakes.  After that, she gave herself a stern warning.  <i>For sure I can't just eat</i> cupcakes <i>the whole time!  By the time we got there, I'd be too fat to fly!</i>   But on the other hand, she was just so bored.  She had to eat <i>some</i>thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I stuff myself with the rest of the supplies</i>, she decided rationally,<i> I won't be tempted to eat more cupcakes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she downed a number of dried apricots and a few dozen nuts and started in on some of the heavy trail bread.  She was starting to fill up nicely, but figured--it was only reasonable after all--that she'd better really stuff herself.  Otherwise she might feel the urge to eat another cupcake.  And then she would get fat.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is for the sake of my figure!</i> she admonished herself as she forced down the last of the bread.   Her stomach was quite packed now, and she wriggled a bit, trying to find a comfortable position on the ham.  She smacked her lips.  They were dry--really dry, after all that bread with nothing to drink.  She slid off the ham, moving a couple of empty bags inside to hit on the waterskin just below her.  It sloshed like a waterbed under her feet.  She uncorked the top and guzzled greedily.  The water was magically cooled and flavored with lemon and berry.  It was deliciously refreshing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie drank until she'd had her fill, then tried to replace the stopper.  But it wouldn't fit.  She tried to force it and only succeeded it having it fly out of her hands.  Now the waterskin was tipping, sliding over.  The water was beginning to pour out and nothing Miffie could think of would stop it!  If her mother saw that something was leaking in the bag, she would investigate for sure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one thing for Miffie to do.  She put her lips to the slipping skin and drank desperately, chugging down the water as quickly as it could leak out.   Maybe...just maybe... she could drain the skin, though she despaired to thing how bloated her poor belly would be by the end of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course the skin was <i>designed</i> to contain this much fluid, while Miffies (as well as pixies in general) were ill-equipped to handle the generous amount of water that she had pilfered. Two weeks of gormandizing or not, Miffie was still a short drink of water\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrong expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stuffing herself intensely as well as drinking the water dry, Miffie was beginning to find the sack quite roomy. She didn\u2019t dare move around, not with her mother and Mr. Archie out there in the cart, but she had found that the slight movements she could afford were now much easier to accomplish without all those pesky provisions in the way. The pudgy pixie would be content, <i>would be</i>, if she didn\u2019t feel like she was about to explode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nestled in a laying position, supported by the natural shape of the cart through the burlap, Miffie sat in silent agony as she battled the beast in her belly. It was so big. So very, very big. And sensitive, her poor tummy was. She had often seen pregnant women in the marketplace, she must have looked like that. One of them, with their swollen orbs of stomachs bobbing in front of them as they walked. The sloshing that echoed from deep inside her stomach made her sick, an awful sensation tensing in the back of her throat. Miffie knew that there was a distinct possibility of vomiting in her near future. But not now, just\u2026 not right now, when she was supposed to be hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paunchy pixie silenced a groan with her free hand, her other one falling to massage the distended dome of her middle. Her skin, pale with a slight shimmer to it, was drawn taut around her stomach. Though she couldn\u2019t quite see it, the tiny breaks in the burlap her only source of light, Miffie\u2019s stomach was quite red. She was in pain. So very, VERY much pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bright eyes, usually so full of whimsical energy, could only wince as she delicately circled her waterbelly\u2019s tight surface. She bared her teeth, hissing slightly as she drew air in and out. Small tears ran vertically across her face as she fought the urge to cry out for her mother. This may have been the most intense pain she\u2019d felt in her entire life, save for\u2026 well, two weeks ago that is\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! If there was one thing Miffie <i>didn\u2019t</i> need right now, it was images of her exploding\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rubbed, her delicate hands seemed to find a sweet spot where the sloshing didn\u2019t hurt quite so much. In an odd, not-really-but-kinda sort of way, it was soothing. The pain didn\u2019t quite melt away, but was rather\u2026 <i>transfigured</i> into something a little more bearable. A tickle, but not quite. And only there\u2014the rest of her still ached in misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not bad, right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this was <i>anything</i> like what those pregnant women at the Market had to go through, it would certainly be a <i>long</i> time before Miffie would be proliferating the pixie race! </span></div></div>",

Kara was about to turn the annoying female ogre into a toad when Miffie had darted outside and spoke with the surprisingly intelligent ogre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scholar's name was one Chunka Glorp and she was researching pixies. Since Miffie was the only pixie around for leagues, Chunka decided to call on her. They had set an appointment for this day and Miffie was to meet Chunka at the inn Chunka was staying at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdly touching her slightly softer middle, Miffie flew towards the inn after kissing her mother goodbye on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeeting Chunka at the inn diner, Miffie couldn't help but marvel at the sheer size of the female scholar. Sure she knew ogres tended to be on the large side, but Chunka was big even for a normal ogre. Miffie had to dodge a few errant jiggles of Chunka's belly as she interviewed her and once even a bit of food that came flying from the ogress's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't know anything about pixie culture then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only what mother has told me.

Doesn't it bother you, to not know about your own race?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie shrugged her shoulders. \"Not really.

We have our disagreements and she can certainly be quite the taskmaster at times but she's my mom, that's what it's supposed to be like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you'll be a better mage than she is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie's face turned red at that and she shrugged her shoulders again. \"Who knows? Mom's been alive for over nine hundred years so she has quite the head-start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you for your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome and good luck with your studies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChunka nodded at that and watched as Miffie flew away. Once she was certain the pixie was gone, Chunka chuckled deeply. She had gotten some good dirt on Kara Skyrider and her brat of an adopted daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFront page, here I come, the undercover reporter thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Miffie entered her home, she found several cupcakes waiting for her on the table and soon enough felt her mother's magic all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home dear. Did the interview go well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was okay, but she started asking about you towards the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara's brows furrowed at that but she soon enough shook her head, sitting down at the table and conjuring up quite the large meal for herself and a few more cupcakes for Miffie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all this for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided that I'm done watching my figure for awhile and you've been doing so well with your magic that a big reward was in order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie nodded at that, guilt flooding her as she watched her pick up her fork, her dark eyes twinkling a bit as she looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet I can eat more than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiffie forced a grin on her face and picked up a bit of frosting with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Intro chapters coming soon; the option to add more will open up once they're up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  Rennie, a bottle gnome alchemist.   Bottle gnomes are a race I've submitted to a couple of other stories, and I like them a lot so let's use 'em here, too.  And why waste a perfectly good description?  Here, from the Bottle Gnome sourcebook:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A short, inquisitive race of humanoids that lives around the world in isolated valleys, calderas, deep woods, or cavern systems--anywhere they can build their communities while remaining safe from the larger and more dangerous races. Their word for themselves is Gnomae, but they are more frequently known as bottle gnomes, a name given to them by human alchemists due to their curious metabolic traits. The bodies of gnomes are hypersensitive to the magical properties of the natural world, and will often draw out and express hidden alchemical properties in their food. Because of this, gnomes tend to express strange characteristics as they age, everything from growing antlers or tails to changing their color or size dramatically to acquiring bizarre powers and abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGnomes are often sought by those who seek to exploit this trait, stuffing them full of the proper ingredients and then extracting the result potion as it's produced. Female gnomes are preferred for this purpose, as they can be easily milked to produce a high-quality, nearly pure extract. Due to a pronounced gluttonous streak, gnomes may voluntarily participate in this endeavor if the ingredients are tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating large quantities of ordinary potatoes will render a bottle gnome highly explosive; this is sometimes used in war. Understandably, there are few volunteers for this service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRennie herself is a young bottle gnome of modest means who's just been apprenticed to a potentially pervy purveyor of potent potable potions.  What lies in store for her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  Suggestions are open!  Drop me a note with your idea and if it's good, I'll put it here.  </span></div></div>",

Golly, don't tell me you forgot I was coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door flew open.  \"Ah, Rennie <i>Poppercork</i>, of course!\" said the slim, dark-haired young man who opened the door.   \"I almost forgot I was advertising for an, er, for an <i>apprentice</i>.\"  He smiled charmingly.  \"Come in, come in!  Ready to work, I see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh!\" Rennie nodded.  She had on a green tunic, sturdy overalls, tough leather boots and strong gloves.  Her chipmunk-brown hair was covered with a broad sunhat, the better to keep any more freckles from forming on her already-freely-freckled face.  \"My book said that alchemy was five percent inspiration, five percent education, and ninety percent digging stuff up!  So... I'm ready to dig stuff up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good!\" the alchemist, one Percival the Pourer by name, said cheerfully.  \"Though you'll find in this line of work your unique, ah, physiological gifts will be far more useful to you than that.  If I wanted dirt turned over, I would have taken on an ogre!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in due time, my dear, all in due time.\"  Percival rubbed his hands together.  \"I see you've been eating quite a plain diet, haven't you?  No antlers, no tail, no scales, no glowing body parts or leaves or feathers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Master,\" Rennie said, bowing, \"at my house we ate boiled mushroot, mostly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The least alchemically active natural substance of all time,\" Percival said, nodding.  \"Of course. Well, we'll soon introduce a little variety into your diet, won't we?  But it's best to start off this way, oh yes, with the cauldron freshly scrubbed out, so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose,\" Rennie said, not quite sure what he was talking about.  All she really knew was that she was expected to help create potions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're ready to dive right in, my girl,\" the alchemist said, \"I've got an assignment you can help with right now!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would have taken forever the conventional way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Healing potions?\" Rennie asked thoughtfully.  \"Those are made of... crimson toadstools and fuff grass, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct!\" Pervical said.  \"Now, we haven't a moment to lose.   You've got to get just as much of that stuff as you can manage on the boil right away.   I know I laid the ingredients out here somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the boil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, start distilling it, down in that wonderful gurgling factory you're currently wrapped around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to... eat it?\" Rennie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness, you mean you didn't know?  Of course!\" Percival said.  \"That's what bottle gnomes do, after all.  Now, you'll need to put away at least a dozen servings of each--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay,\" Rennie said, trying to sound enthusiastic as she watched the heavy bins be set down on the creaking table.  Twin mountains of shiny mushrooms and soft grass towered before her.  <i>A dozen servings?  Of</i> each?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was an apprentice, after all, and apprentices did what they were told, even when their stomachs felt funny at the very thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you alternate bites!\" Pervical told her as she began working on the food.  \"We want it nice and mixed in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'b doid'--\"  she swallowed, \"--I'm doing my best, Master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back and forth, back and forth, until she'd eaten so many bites she lost count.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Rennie, stop eating,\" Percival said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank.  Goodness!\"  Rennie sighed, pushing herself away from the table and patting her stomach.  \"I'm <i>stuffed!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this break will do you good, then,\" the alchemist observed.   \"We need to mix up what's in there; how about a jog around the room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh.  Oh, I couldn't possibly--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rennie, this is<i> quite</i> important for aerating the potion.  Five laps should do it, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStifling a groan, Rennie slid out of her chair and started on a circuit of the cottage.  It wasn't a big room, but her short legs and full belly made running a real chore.   By the third lap she was breathing hard, and by the fourth, a nasty stitch was stinging her along the short length of her side.   Finishing the fifth, she hauled herself back into the chair and released a loud, cathartic belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!   Get that air our of your system,\" Percival said, clapping.  \"Now we're ready for the second layer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The second layer?</i>  Rennie thought in alarm as her new master slid the bins of ingredients back up toward her.  <i>H-how many are there going to be?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That'll be for taste and texture. You'll be downing it after your second jog. Bon appetit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning, she sat back down, wincing as her stomach pressed up against the table. It was beginning to get drum-taut with ingredients, as she set back to emptying the bins. \"Blurghh...\" The mountains were slowly worn down by her steady grazing, until finally they vanished, leaving nothing but a pitcher of syrup and a green-faced gnome. \"I... I think I'm gonna be sick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no! Then you'll have to do it all over again! Just take a little jaunt around the room, you'll feel fine!\" Groaning, she did as she was told, her massive, overstretched belly sloshing and bouncing as she did lap after lap, sweat running down her body as she finished. \"Huff... Huff... BRAAAAAAAAAPH. Wugh. I'm... I'm...\" She looked to the pitcher. \"I'm not done yet, I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite! It's the home stretch, Rennie! Just open your mouth, tilt your head back, and think happy thoughts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercival took the pitcher in hand as the hapless bottle gnome did as she was told, then poured the syrup down her throat. It was... Well, actually, it was oddly pleasant. It tasted nice, and she could feel it warming her body and tingling through her fingers. It still took up a lot of space in her stomach, though... After this, she didn't think she'd be able to fit anything else in without a tamping rod being jammed down her throat. Finally, the sweetish trickle of syrup stopped, and the bottle gnome was left to recline on her chair, when she suddenly felt the alchemist's fingers kneading around her stomach. Blushing, but too stuffed full of food to really protest, she settled for an apprehensive gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merely some final ministrations, to see how it's forming... Hmmm... Hmmm....\" He patted her stomach like a drum, flicked it a few times... Once she even thought she could feel him LICKING her belly button. \"Hmmmm... Well...\"</span></div></div>",

Eat anything else?  The very idea filled her with horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffed to such repletion that she could scarcely move, she dozed on and off in the chair as the sun sank from its zenith to the horizon.  She woke around nightfall, blinking with the strange confusion of the late-afternoon napper.   She felt better, now--much less uncomfortable--but the stuffed feeling in her middle had given way to an overall sensation of bloating.  Her breasts felt tender and swollen, pushing against the shoulder straps of her overalls.  She squirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, looks like you're ready!\" the alchemist exclaimed.  \"Let's get started on that order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled a vial from his sleeve and approached Rennie, pulling her shirt down and pressing the vial against the nipple.  She gasped from the sudden fell of cold glass against her sensitive skin.   Then Percival began expertly kneading, forcing a thin stream of red liquid from the nipple.  He continued the process, filling first one vial, then another, then another, all the while taking frequent breaks to give swigs from a pitcher of water.  \"Must stay hydrated,\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRennie didn't mind; with every filled vial she felt a little more relief as the pressure on her middle eased up.   When Percival had filled a dozen vials, he stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are...are you sure?,\" Rennie said, red-faced and sweating.  \"I-I still feel a little...full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not every bit of the ingredients is broken down; you still have to digest those in the normal way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Rennie laughed nervously.  \"Golly!  I sure hope I don't get fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!  The bigger the better, my dear.  We must step up production, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"  Rennie looked down at the small pot belly rounding out her overalls and sighed.   \"Goodie.\"</span></div></div>",

So here's one set in a generic fantasy universe, the sort EVERYONE is familiar with, thanks to half a century of everybody shamelessly ripping off Tolkien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSame rules as the other stories, mostly--<br>\r\n1) In general, try to keep it focused on amounts people could potentially eat and gradual, realistic gains (of course, there is some leeway here given that the adventures aren't human, so their capacities could potentially be a bit more).<br>\r\n2) Avoid scat, exploding, children being involved in anything sexual or fetishy, non-food/drink related inflation, male WG, immobility, death of the main characters, or excessive slobbiness.  Given that some of them are rather monstrous, vore may make an appearance, but please don't get too graphic.<br>\r\n3) Try to add character and story as well as pure sexy stuff, it keeps things interesting!<br>\r\n4) Try to use good grammar, spelling, and punctuation.  I'll try to catch and fix any mistakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you follow these and make your addition a decent length, I'll do my best to follow up any additions (eventually!)  Have fun!<br>\r\n</td>",
