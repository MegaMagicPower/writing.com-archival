            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>    Molly sighed.  She should have been happy, it was her 18th birthday in a couple of days, she should be looking forward to the party and the alcohol and one of her final steps into adulthood, but truth of it was, Molly wasn't.  Molly wasn't excited at all.  She felt disillusioned with life, she was fed up with the constant demands in her life, either from school, from her mom or from her part time job at the family restaurant.  She just wished she could go back to simpler times when nothing really mattered other than playing games.  She wouldn't tell that to anyone though.  Oh no.  That would be too much.  Instead she would play her part in society, doing as she was told and toeing the line, living on her daydreams of happier, more innocent times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She brushed a strand of her long brown hair out of her brown eyes and adjusted the black hair band that held her hair out of her faceShe wasn't ugly, not by a long shot, but she had a plain quality about her that just made most people ignore she was even there.  Everyone with the exception of Jennifer and Sarah. The threesome shouldn't have worked.  It was still difficult to understand how they had come to be such firm friends.  Perhaps the fact that they were each misfits to some degree.  Either way the three of them were very rarely seen parted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Molly wandered over to Sarah and Jennifer's table and placed their coffees and sandwiches down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Here you go guys.  Glad you both could come over and spend time with me at work.  It's so dull around here.  Time really drags.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer picked up her hot coffee cup and blew gently on the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"don't mention it.  It's not like we were doing much today anyway\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded in agreement but didn't add anything to the conversation as she picked up her sandwich and tucked in.  Molly smiled at her two friends.  She was about to say something when one of her work colleagues came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey. Molly.  Once you're finished serving these customers get some gloves and a mop and bucket will ya.  A kid has peed in the ball pool again and it needs disinfecting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly sighed as she looked over at the restaurants safe play area for children.  So many times she was wanted to take a dip in the ball pool and mess around, instead she was forced to clear the thing out whenever a kid lost a diaper or was sick.  She nodded miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" I better go guys.\"  She muttered apologetically at her friends and went to gather the cleaning supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n An hour later she pulled herself from the children's play area, a strong smell of disinfectant wafted around the ball pool now that her job was done. She felt satisfied she had done a good job as she pulled off her yellow marigolds.  She didn't enjoy her job but she took pride in her professionalism.  She wanted to show a girl who took her job seriously.  Even the mucky parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Her train of thought was suddenly brought back to the present when she realised someone was stood right beside her.  She looked up, shocked by the smiling old woman stood beside her.  Her shocked expression vanished as she recognised the strange woman that had been coming into the restaurant every day for the past week around lunchtime, like it was now.  Molly had even gotten to know the woman a little bit, she was on holiday from Europe, visiting relatives although molly had never seen any of the relatives in here with the old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh hello Mrs Murphy. Can I help you at all?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly's mannerisms were always polite, even when she was feeling depressed like today.  Mrs Murphy just stared at Molly for a few moments.  Molly wondered if the woman had even heard her question and was about to repeat herself when Mrs Murphy spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Dear, I go back to Britain today, so I wanted to just pop in and give you something for being such wonderful company here over the past few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly was stunned,  she had been kind to Mrs Murphy but she hadn't expected to be rewarded for something that should be second nature to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh,  Mrs Murphy, seriously you didn't have to do anything for me.  It was a pleasure being your waitress\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly blushed, her heart fluttered happily that her attention to the customers and her job had been recognised as Mrs Murphy handed her a digital voice recorder .   Molly took it and stared dumbly at the device not realising what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Errr...thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said not wanting to sound unkind, but not entirely sure what Mrs Murphy expected her to do with it.  Mrs Murphy leaned in, whispering in a conspiratorial manner.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n \"That my dear in a reality altering device.  Press the red button here, that pauses things then, say what you want into the microphone piece here and TA-DA instant altered reality.  I'm giving it to you, because I can tell you'll put it to good use.  You have a kind heart.  I can tell.  I have a sense for these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly realised the poor old woman was clearly at that age where people started loosing their marbles and she plastered a fake grin on her face and hugged the digital voice recorder .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you Mrs Murphy.  That was awfully thoughtful of you\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly didn't want to upset the old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Go on dear.  Try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Mrs Murphy poked Molly in the upper arm eagerly.  Molly looked at the device, feeling stupid.  She didn't want to dash this poor woman's delusion, but Mrs Murphy didn't seem to want to take no for an answer.  Feeling ridiculous she pressed the red button, then thinking what she could do her eyes fell on her two friends, more importantly their hair colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Jennifer hair colour is black, Sarah's hair colour is red\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly felt instantly light headed and it seemed that the room grew dark.  She felt like she was going to faint, but then the light returned to the room and the sick feeling she had had vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around wondering if anyone had noticed anything strange but the few people in the restaurant were chatting as if nothing bizarre had happened at all. Maybe Molly had just been too close to the disinfectant.  It had been pretty strong.  She should have used proper ventilation.  Her gaze wandered over to Jennifer and Sarah.  They were arguing with each other, a common occurrence, but what Molly saw almost made her drop the digital voice recorder .  Both her friends hair had changed colour to match her command.  Her mouth fell open, gob smacked.  Mrs Murphy shuffled off to one side chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well,  have fun kiddo. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly ran up to Mrs Murphy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, wait.  You can't just give it to me...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Murphy cut the teenager off mid sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I can and I have.  It's rude to give gifts back sweetie so just be careful with it and look after yourself\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently patted Molly on the arm and continued out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly stood in the middle of the restaurant completely bewildered by the whole experience.  She rubbed her eyes and looked at her two friends new hair colour.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her gaze wandered down to the bucket of disinfecting water she had used to clean the ball pool.  Reality struck her then, she was still at work and had to be seen to be actually working.  Picking up the bucket she headed back to the staff kitchen.  When she got there she put the bucket down.  The kitchen was empty, she sighed at the amount of dishes needing washing up that she still had to do, but she needed to seriously think about what was going on here.  Her mind was still reeling from what had just happened.  She looked at the small device in her hand.  Unable to really comprehend the power she had.  She now had the ability to make all her dreams come true at the press of a button.  The possibilities were staggering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was torn between wanting to throw the small machine in the bin for fear of accidentally turning reality into a nightmare, but her teenage curiosity screamed at her to try it out more.  Do something more extreme.  What had she always wanted? Money?  Fame?  These things didn't really tempt her all that much. She traced her finger around the button, holding her breath.  So many ideas on what to do, her mind boggled.  She caught sight of the time. She only had half an hour left of work and she hadn't even had her break today yet due to that stupid play area incident.  She looked at the bucket of water and the dirty dishes stacked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed the button hard. Scrunching up her eyes.  She opened them and noticed the muffled babbling from the restaurant had faded.  She peeked her head round the door way and saw life paused.  Like a still on a T.V screen. Some people had stopped midway through eating and a kid who had been in the midst of jumping into the ball pool hung suspended in mid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quietly returned to the kitchen feeling weak at the sight of something, that up until 20 minutes ago she would have sworn was impossible.  She spoke into the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The dishes were all done, the mop and bucket was away even the microwave and fridge had been wiped down and polished.  The place was gleaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped the device in surprise and it clattered to the floor, instantly she stooped and picked it up, checked for signs of damage but it didn't seem to have a dent in it.  It really looked like this was the real deal.  She heart beat wildly.  She could bend reality to her personal whims. The colour drained from her face.  It was such a powerful thing to own<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the digital voice recorder  in her pocket and wandered out the kitchen back into the main restaurant then over to her friend's table not sure what to say.  Both friends stopped chatting heatedly as Molly approached.  They both looked at her and concerned expressions crossed their faces.  It was Sarah who spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Molly?  Are you all right?  You look ill.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly nodded dumbfounded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i'm fine, really.  Just need a quiet seat.\"  She slumped down into a chair as Jennifer scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Quiet seat. HA!  You'll be lucky with all those kids running around and screaming in the play area.  Its like a herd of elephants in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly looked over at the play area, wishing for the umpteenth time that she could play in there without being stared at like an oddball.  Her mouth went dry as she suddenly contemplated the digital voice recorder .  Would it work like that?  She looked at Jennifer's black hair and Sarah's red hair.  She quietly pulled the digital voice recorder  up out of her pocket and pressed the red button, the whole restaurant seemed to suddenly hush as reality was paused, a small smile played on her lips as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There it was again, that sickening woozy feeling, the way the air seemed to grow darker, thicken, and then suddenly the room was bright again and the general background rabble of conversations had returned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly looked around feeling like people must have been looking at her but no-one was.  Suddenly Sarah bounced out of her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know what'll cheer you up.  20 minutes in the ball pool.  That always cheers you up.  You're due for a break from work now anyway right?  Come on\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah grabbed Molly's hand and hauled her to her feet.  Once it looked like Molly was going to follow her, Sarah broke away from her older friend and raced over to the play area, easily vaulting the soft padded fence and plunged into the ball pit squealing with glee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly's heart raced into her throat.  She looked around and noticed that no one was paying any attention to the fact that her 17 year old friend was shouting and laughing whilst playing in the ball pit.  With a deep breath molly followed her friend and jumped into the soft balls scattering them everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Molly was in heaven.  She laughed and giggled as she swam through the balls then clambered up a near by netted ladder to throw herself down a slide that plunged her right back into the large ball pool.  She loved every moment of it.  She had wanted to do this for months.  She felt content.  Happy.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer wandered over to the side of the play area, she looked skyward.  She was getting too old to play in the pit but she wanted to be with her friends she she stepped beyond the barrier and eased herself into the ball pit.  There were other kids of various ages in the play area and one boy decided Jennifer would be a good target.  He started throwing balls at her and one ball bounced off her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you little bastard, what the hell do you think you're playing at\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Molly had been swimming past at the time and she was shocked by Jennifer's language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, you don't have to swear at him, he's just playing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but the little dick went and messed up my hair\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She whined, regretting getting into the ball pit in the first place.  Molly wasn't impressed by the swearing.  She had been enjoying her little bit of innocence here in the play area but Jennifer's potty mouth had ruined her mood.  She dug deeper under the balls in the ball pit and pulled out the digital voice recorder  from her pocket.  She pushed the button, recognising the fact that above the surface of the balls it had suddenly gone quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"18 year olds do not know how to swear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe popped her head up over the balls and grinned at Jennifer allowing the older 18 year old to continue her rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's such a stupid poopoo doody head.  I hate him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer turned and stuck her tongue out at the boy, who mimicked her action and ran off laughing.  Jennifer folded her arms, sulking, it was then that she caught her watch seeing the time she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Molly.  Isn't your shift up now?  Are you coming to with us to stay over at my house tonight like we discussed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly nodded enthusiastically, she had been looking forward to the sleep over all day.  Sarah clapped happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAY YAY party!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw her fists up into the air excitedly, scattering balls everywhere causing Molly to laugh as the balls showered down on her.  The three friends clambered out of the ball pit.  Molly looked back at it wistfully.  It had been such fun playing in there.  A dream come true.  She patted her pocket feeling the bulk of the recorder there.  How much further could she take this dream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gathered her bags that she had brought to work with her in anticipation of the sleepover and said goodbye to her work colleagues as she followed Jennifer and Sarah  out of the restaurant. Sarah and Jennifer chatted animatedly about school and the latest episodes of their favourite drama series, whilst Molly hung back a little contemplating her options.  Soon though the three of them were at Jennifer's house and she pushed open the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yo MOM!  I'm Home.  Sarah and Molly are staying over okay!\"  She shouted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an excited scream from one of the rooms and a little three year old girl came piling out of the room and catapulted herself into Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Jenny Jenny Yoor home!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl hugged her big sisters legs happily.  Molly Loved Jennifer' sister Tabitha.  She was such a bubbly little thing and it always uplifted Molly to see such a happy kid.  Jennifer pulled her little sister off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Awww Tabby your covered in paint!  You got it all over my skirt...you...you...Stinkybutt!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabby giggled and stepped back.  Molly could see she was wearing a cute set of pink overalls with white flowers embroidered on the chest pocket.  Molly's heart ached to wear something that adorable and without so much as a second thought she whipped the recording device from her pocket and eagerly pressed the button. She whispered in fevered anticipation, her hand trembling at the thought of the potential outfits she would hopefully suddenly find at her disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sickening feeling was partially ignored by Molly's excitement.  The blackness swamped in around her and faded back out and she let out a large audible squeal of delight when she looked down at herself and at her friends.<br>\r\nInstead of her restaurant uniform Molly now wore a pair of grass green overalls with chunky multicoloured corduroy flowers and buttons stitched into them.  Her long brown hair was in 2 bunches ties with yellow ribbon.  Her black work shoes had been replaced by white sneakers that had velcro instead of shoe laces.  Molly jumped up and down unable to contain how giddily happy she felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was wearing a yellow sun dress her new red hair was in a single ponytail that had a large sunflower clip in the back of her hair she wore flipflops on her feet. Jennifer had a short ruffled denim skirt on and a t-shirt that had happy cartoon characters on the front.  Her hair was loose.<br>\r\nMolly bent down and ruffled Tabby's hair.  Thankful to the toddler for giving her such an awesome idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi kiddo.  How's things?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Tabby to giggle shyly and run from the three girls back into the room from where she had come.  Jennifer dumped her bag at the front door as she looked at the paint on her denim skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a monkey!  I'm going to have to get changed now.\"  She stormed off up the stairs.  She called down to her two friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys make yourselves at home i'll be down in a second.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thudded her way up the rest of the stairs, Molly could hear Jennifer muttering words like 'smelly' and 'stupid head' to herself and Molly chuckled to herself thinking how cute Jennifer sounded.  The recording device was amazing.  It seemed that only she knew that reality had been altered, everyone else seemed to accept everything as normality.  Molly and Sarah wandered into the lounge area where Tabby was sat in the middle of the carpet painting.  Jennifer's mom was sat on the sofa keeping an eye on tabby whilst watching some soap opera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Molly, hi Sarah. Come in, come in. don't just stand on parade.  You've been here enough that you're practically family.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's mom twisted in her seat to smile over at the two teenagers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mrs Tamworth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah said taking a nearby seat and slumping into it, dropping her bag down by her feet.  Molly copied her friend sitting down beside her.  Tabby looked up at her mommy and the two new guests and grinned then her smile suddenly changed and she scrambled to her feet and rushed round the other side of the sofa where Molly couldn't see her.  The three women watched the TV for a bit, not actually saying anything to anyone then tabby reappeared from around the other side of the sofa, carrying a red plastic potty.  She was grinning from ear to ear as she tottered towards her mommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy MOMMY!  LOOK LOOK I DID IT! I WEED\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mommy shot off the sofa and gently took the clearly full potty from her toddler so that the proud little girl wouldn't accidentally slosh the contents onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay Tabitha.  Who's getting to be all grown up.  Soon you'll get to wear big girl pants all the time.  You're doing so well!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mommy clapped her hands enthusiastically praising her little girl as the woman left the room, the toddler following singing and clapping <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay yay yay.  I went in da potteee\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly chuckled.  Kids that age were just ridiculously cute.  Molly had no recollection of her own potty training.  Did she get praised like that?  Molly carefully took the recorder out of her pocket.  Did she want to experience potty training again?  It would be interesting just for a little while.  She could put it all back afterwards and no-one would be any wiser.  She pressed the button and licked her lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She instantly noticed that her pants felt thicker but she couldn't see because of the overalls she wore.  Sarah suddenly burst into tears. Molly flinched at the unexpected noise and she quickly rushed over to where Sarah was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah?  Sarah?  What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah simply lifted her yellow sun dress to show her cute princess pull-ups and the fact that the pictures had been washed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I...I...Had an ACCIDENT!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah wailed helplessly as big sloppy tears rolled down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sarah!  It's okay.  It's okay\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly patted her friend's shoulder reassuringly as Jennifer's Mom came back into the room at the sound of all the crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's all the fuss abou.....Oh. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's mom was by Sarah's side in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sweetie, come on now, lets get you cleaned up.  It's okay if you had an accident it happens to everyone when they're learning to be a big girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This made Sarah wail even louder <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...But I am a big girl\"  She sobbed and Jennifer's mom pulled her up off the sofa and gave her a reassuring hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes you are, but your much younger than Jennifer and even Molly is bigger than you so you're doing really well to be staying dry just as much as they are.  You should be really proud of yourself.  But it's okay to have an accident once in a while.  Lets get you into a fresh pull-up okay\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded meekly and allowed herself to be led over to a pack of pull-ups in the corner of the lounge.  Jennifers mom pulled Jessica's wet pull-up down and cleaned her private area with a couple of baby wipes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.  Do you need to use the potty before I put you in a new pull-up?\"  Jennifer's mom asked tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Sarah thought about it for a moment then shyly shook her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, good girl now step into this okay\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had pulled a fresh pull-up from the pack and was holding it open so that Sarah could step into the leg holes which she did without question and Jennifer's mom pulled them up to snap snuggly onto the 17 year old's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There we go, isn't that much better.  Try to stay dry okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah brushed the tears out of her eyes and put on a brave face, nodding in a determined fashion.  Jennifer's mom patted Sarah on the arm and went back to her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly had watched all this with complete interest.  She felt sorry that Sarah had ended up having an accident, but wasn't sure if she could, or even should, bring herself to do the same thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jennifer came into the room smiling now that she was in a pale blue short baby doll dress with white ankle socks and a blue hair band holding her hair out of her eyes.  Molly had never seen Jennifer look so babyish and adorable.  Jennifer saw Molly staring and did a quick twirl, the dress fluttered up to show Jennifer's princess pull-ups too, but she wasn't embarrassed.  This was normality for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do you like it?  My Mom bought it for me yesterday I wanted to show it to you guys, to see what you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah wrapped her arms around her own waist and hugged herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jenny that's beautiful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Molly had been about to call her adorable but she didn't know if that would make Jennifer go into a fit.  Jennifer didn't like cute or cuddly things.  The term Beautiful seemed to have done the trick though and Jennifer beamed happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you guys would like it. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She looked at her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom can we go upstairs and watch TV and hang?  I'm gonna order pizza as well kay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom twisted round in her seat and  smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure sweetie, just make sure you take your potty with you and just remember to tinkle when you need to\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer scoffed.  \"Mom I haven't had an accident for almost four whole days now.  I think I can tell when I need to go.\"  Jennifer whined at her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Her mom chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know sweetie and you know the rules, a week dry in pull-ups and you can have big girl panties so you're almost there I just don't want you to ruin your track record because you're engrossed in playing with your friends that's all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer nodded her scowl evaporating as she realised her mom was simply looking out for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay mom.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe collected the red potty in the corner of the room and then turned to Molly and Sarah,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys, lets go to my room\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls excused themselves from the lounge and headed upstairs rapidly.  In Jennifers room it looked like any normal 18 year old's room, random band posters dotted the walls a tv, music system and games consol lay in one corner.  A wardrobe and desk complete with laptop.  Molly smirked.  It felt strange to still be on the verge of being a grown up yet still potty training.  Jennifer crossed the room and turned on her TV. Some reality program was on and Jennifer clapped happily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it's only just started, I thought we were going to miss it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly slumped onto the bed and rolled her eyes to the ceiling as Sarah rushed over to the beanbag that Jennifer had flopped into and settled herself on the end of it to watch the program too. Sarah and Jennifer talked non stop about this stupid program about how Bradley and Joe were always fighting to get laid with that Lulu girl and that there was always a cat fight between Lulu and Rachel.  It bored the pants off of Molly who couldn't care less about reality T.V.  It was a waste of space and time and it was what her two friends argued about the most.  Her friends weren't paying her any attention as she pulled her reality altering device from her pocket at pressed the button without hesitation.  It wasn't right to be in the midst of potty training whilst still watching T.V filled with filth and pointless arguments and drama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Her two friends were still arguing but it was about which colour Teletubby was the best.  Feeling full of total happiness Molly rushed over to her two friends and threw herself into the middle of the bean bag causing the two other girls to be catapulted from the beanbag and squeal in shock at the sudden intrusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone knows the red one is the best teletubby\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Molly giggled happy to be part of one of her friend's arguments for once.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening progressed as it grew dark outside, the pizza came and they ate it happily amongst themselves in Jennifer's room as they watched cartoons and played video games.  Soon it was getting close to bedtime.  Jennifers mom yelled up from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lights out in twenty minutes girls its almost 11pm\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three made a collective \"AWWWW!\" noise but Molly and Sarah scrambled to their bags to get their pyjamas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly opened her bag and gasped in delight as she pulled a baby pink footed sleeper from her bag.  She hugged the fleecy garment almost audibly purring at the soft feel of it.  She pulled it out and took the opportunity to put her recorder in her bag, she doubted she would need it for the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned round and grinned at Jennifer and Sarah only there were tears in Jennifer's eyes.  Molly had never seen Jennifer cry before and the look on her friend's face startled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer are you okay\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was quiet but shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  It suddenly occured to Molly what was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...Did you have an accident\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer just burst into a sob.  Molly rushed over.  Sarah sat on the beanbag, knowing how it felt.  Jennifer put her hand over her mouth to stop the crying and she looked at Molly her eyes pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly, mom can't know about this. I stayed dry for three whole days.  If she finds out i'm wet, it'll be reset and I won't be in big girl pants for ages.  Trade with me.  Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trade with me.  You're still dry right?

Jennifer was lucky that Molly was such a nice person and she guessed she owed Jennifer since it was her device that had made it so the teenagers were in the midst of potty training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Molly was just standing in her pink t-shirt and pull-up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny take yours off\"  She said quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifers sobbing stopped instantly as she fumbled under her blue dress and pulled down the soaked pull-up, stepping out of it gingerly she handed it to Molly.  Molly didn't take it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i'm not actually putting that back on me.  That's disgusting but...turn round\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at Jennifer and Sarah as they suddenly understood she was ordering them to avert their gaze.  Once the two had looked away. Molly pulled her own dry pull-up down and pulled her overalls back on to hide the fact she wore no pants.  She didn't do up the buckles on the straps as she would be in getting into her new footed sleeper in a minute.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you can turn back around now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls did and Molly handed Jennifer the dry pull-up.  Jennifer smiled through her wet blotchy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Molls You're the best!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer handed Molly the wet one again so that she could use both hands to pull the dry one on.  Molly took it, holding it out as if it was contaminated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"eeewww\"  She giggled making jennifer blush as she pulled the dry one up between her legs and out of view under the blue dress she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom door suddenly swung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just making sure you girls are getting ready for bed...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole room froze and for once Molly wished it had been because she had pressed her reality altering device.  Sadly it was through shock.  Jennifers mom surveyed what lay before her for a few moments.  She saw Molly holding the wet pull-up, her overalls unbuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She asked as she crossed the room and held out her hands towards Molly indicting to the teenager that she wanted the wet pull-up.  Molly gladly released it into her hands. It was then that she felt the hot trickle between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no no!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmolly moaned as she grabbed at her crotch, a large dark patch staining the front of her childish overalls.  Jennifers mom simply tutted in mild annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly.  it's okay if you have an accident...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held out the wet pull-up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But you can't just take them off by yourself and not put on a fresh one or THAT happens!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She pointed to the expanding wet patch and the mess Molly was in the midst of making.  Molly was mortified as her bladder emptied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but...\"   Molly stammered but Jennifers mom cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts young lady. Downstairs now so I can clean you up.  I promised your mom you could stay the night and she assured me you'd be well behaved.  Don't go proving her wrong kiddo okay\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly simply nodded.  She didn't want to get Jennifer in trouble and telling the truth about the owner of the wet pull-up probably wouldn't do Molly any good now that she had wet herself in front of everyone.  Poor timing to say the least.  Molly took a quick glance backwards as she was frog marched out of the bedroom in her wet overalls and down the stairs.  She saw Jennifer looking back, wide eyed but her expression full of gratitude for Molly's sacrifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly was quickly stripped and wiped clean, then helped into a clean pull-up.  She felt embarrassed but at the end of it.  Jennifer's mom pulled her into a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be all right.  I didn't mean to snap at you but potty training is tricky and you shouldn't take unnecessary risks okay.  I don't want to catch you doing that again or I'll take drastic action and put you back into diapers for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly shied away from the idea.  That would be a little too embarrassing especially in front of Sarah and Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be good Mrs Tamworth.  I promise\"  molly said sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's mom smiled. \"Good girl now get to bed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly scrambled up the stairs in just her t-shirt and pull-up having left her pyjamas back in Jennifer's room.  Jenny and Sarah were already in their footed sleepers.  Jennifer was in her bed and Sarah was laying on top of her starry patterned sleeping bag on the floor.  Molly noticed that her own sleeping bag was a blue's clues one.  That cheered her up a little.  She picked up her footed sleeper and stepped into it pulling it up to her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for covering for me Molls.  I really owe you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer mumbled gratefully.  Molly shrugged and grinned at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what friends do right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer nodded in appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's gonna be so cool when the three of us finally graduate in a week from high school and go to college.  We'll look out for each other through thick and thin huh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Molly nodded but her smile faded.  College.  In her reality altering stupor she had forgotten that graduation was coming up very soon and that they would be expected to attend college.  She really didn't want to go, but Jennifer and Sarah seemed so excited about it.  Molly just wanted a carefree life.  Was that so much to ask?<br>\r\nShe pulled her t-shirt off and un-hooked her bra but didn't pull it off, instead she slipped her arms into the sleeper and then threaded her bra straps out from underneath so that she didn't expose herself to her friends.  She zipped up her sleeper and then, making a decision she wandered over to her bag and pulled out her reality altering device pressing the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She dumped the device back in her bag and was about to zip it up when she realised her teddy bear was in there.  She pulled the fluffy pink bear out and smiled at it's smiley face.  It had a zipper in its back so that a hot water bottle could be placed inside.  Having a genius thought she pulled the small hot water bottle out and getting the device back out of her bag she stuffed it inside the teddy bear.  It was a perfect hiding spot.  She smiled at her cleverness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait till we get to learn the whole alphabet.

She found that she couldn't quite get her thoughts around the names for each letter. It felt weird but in a good way.  In an exciting fresh innocent way.  She found herself giggling and both her friends looked at her oddly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly?  What's so funny?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer asked  Molly just grinned at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i'm just really happy that tomorrow is one of our last days at daycare\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to be a good enough explanation for Jennifer and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, no more baby stuff, we're gonna be big girls\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three teenagers snuggled down into their beds.  Molly looked around the room which now had posters of kids cartoons on the walls and the shelves were scattered with kids story books and toys.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her heart beat madly in her chest.  This was the sort of thing she had always dreamed of. She felt at peace with herself, her carefree nature finally being realised in reality.  She hugged her pink teddybear as tears of happiness trickled down her face.  She wiped them away feeling a little bit silly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's mom pushed the door open to see all three girls tucked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night girls, see you in the morning.  You've got a busy day at daycare so sleep well\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer's mom switched off the bedroom light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nite mom\"  Jennifer mumbled.

It was tough being the only child of parents who owned a restaurant. It seemed that she was always having to work. Upon returning home Molly went straight to her room and flopped down onto her bed. As her bag hit the ground Molly was reminded of the device that Mrs. Murphy had given her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow seemed like as good of a time as any to try it out.

He is arriving shortly in order to give me my usual massage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly released the button and reality shifted. The doorbell rang and she raced to greet Chas. Chas gave her a big kiss before entering. She took his hand and lead him up to her room. Chas brought with him a bag full of various massage oils and tools. He placed his bag on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I love giving you massages, Molly, but it would be a lot easier with an actual massage table.\" Chas said as Molly sat on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly grabbed the remote and froze reality. \"I have a massage table in my closet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she unfroze reality she opened the closet and pulled the massage table from its hiding spot. Chas set the table up and waited for Molly. Molly laid down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you forgetting something?\" Chas asked. \"You can't get your massage with your clothes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly blushed. The thought of being naked in front of Chas embarrassed her. Prior to Chas' arrival, she had never even kissed a boy. Now, she was expected to be nude in front of her boyfriend. Molly slowly undressed as Chas averted his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid down on the table and Chas began to massage her back. He rubs the oil all over her neck, shoulders, back, legs, and feet. Molly moans in ecstasy as Chas' hands release all of the tension from her tired muscles. She feels a tingling sensation that she had never felt before. Chas was turning her on. Was this what all of her teen magazines had talked about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChas finished the massage and wiped his hands. He looked down at his girlfriend and smiled. He loved how beautifully she glistened after her massage. Then, he spied the remote on Molly's nightstand. She had fiddled with it earlier and he was curious why she had a remote control when there was no TV in her room. </span></div></div>",
