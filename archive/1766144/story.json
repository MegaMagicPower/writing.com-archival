However due to her hunger, she did not notice at all that there was anything wrong. Her sister, Hansa, on the other hand, realized soon after she started eating that she was still hungry even after consuming a rather large quantity of food, especially by her standards. She tried to warn Gretel, but she was too busy eating. Soon Hansa's hunger also took hold of her once again and she resumed her consumption of the delectable home. However, both girls stop eating when...</span></div></div>",

By the time the old woman finished the food Hansa and Gretal were drooling from the smell. As she was bringing out the food Hansa asked the old woman,\"What is your name?\" The old woman answered with a hearty, \" Matilda, and yours?\" \"My name is Hansa, and this is Gretal.\" After that nobody really talked because the girls were too busy eating. Matilda watched as Gretal had to unbutton her pants because her once small potbelly started looking so big that it looked as if she had swallowed a beach ball.

She locked the door behind her as she left to fetch the other girl.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMoving Gretal proved to be more difficult, as the far plumper child weighed much more than Hansa. With a grunt, the witch lifted her as well, and took her into another, similar room, setting her down onto the hay. This pig wouldn't need much encouragement to become a nice pot-bellied roast, but the smaller one would need to be force fed, most likely. The witch left the room, once again locking the door behind her as she walked toward the kitchen to start working on the next day's meals.</span></div></div>",

My friend and I are lost since one two hours and we don't know where we are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-What we do know is that we are quite hungry, said desesperatly Hansa. Please, do you have some food and some way to contact our dad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman took a good look on the two sisters. It has been quite a while since the last time she got kids in these woods. These two girls were young and tender. The shorter one, Hansa, seems to have 16 years old and was pretty thin; nothing to get excited about. As for her older sister, Gretel, she was 19 years old and wasn'rt much bigger; she just had more curves. After some weeks, they could be quite a good diner...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Oh my sweet children, you should come to my house, replied the old woman. I have a lot food and a roof for you. I don't have any phone, but we could figure out something when we are there, no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I'm down, says Hansa. We should go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Yeah...but I'm still suspicious, replied Gretel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Do you really prefer to stay in these woods? It would be dark soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Yeah...</span></div></div>",

Her hips had grown wider over the past few weeks, as had her backside, which was bouncing slightly behind her. Her jeans were stretched tight around her thicker waist and soon to be ripped. Her belly was rounder and soft.<br>\r\nGranny was salivating at the look of the young pumpler.<br>\r\n\"Three more months at best and she is going to make a perfect centerpiece for a real feast! Look at that bacon on her ribs, look at that ham slowly developping on her behind!
