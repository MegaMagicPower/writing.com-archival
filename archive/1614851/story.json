Only I can do that, as John is my charactor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that doesn't mean that you can't add to the rest of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny monster is allowed, from every folklore, from every legand, from everywhere. However, they must have all met John at some point in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that I ask is this, leave options for others to follow, including options dealing with humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note* The story is finished, and so is the editing. Enjoy the story guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPLEASE, read the story before you add something to it. I don't want your additions to conflict with my story. Also, leave alternatives for other people to use, so that they can add their own character to the story. Note, see under male child for an example of what I am talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS If something happened to the person you decide to use in the main story, the same thing must happen in your story. For instance, Julia first met John when he saved her from being a young kitsune's breakfast, that doesn't change. John later kills that kitsune's father, that doesn't change. However, if it wasn't mentioned in the main story, like say if you want to be the young kitsune when he hears that his father was killed by someone, go ahead. However, contact me first before you put it up, especially if it deals with John's past, from the view of one of his friends, or one of his named friends themselves.</span></div></div>",

After that, he could turn back into his human form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he could change into any of those forms, at any height between his normal human one, all the way to his largest giant, or giant-werewolf, size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in any shape or form, John was a force to be reckoned with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout school he had gained the reputation as being a \u201cvegetarian\u201d in that he wouldn\u2019t eat the flesh of other sentient beings, unless he had no real choice, even going so far as to assault the principal when he had eaten a student who had been a disciplinarian\u2019s worst nightmare, in how he behaved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, John always had the perfect, legitimate, and therefore, legal excuse, that the student was his \u201cPet\u201d or slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy law, monsters could claim humans, and weaker monsters, as \u201cpets\u201d and slaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese so-called pets and slaves had to wear collars around their necks, with a tag that had the name of their owner, and the owner\u2019s address, on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were also used for various things, from being made to do chores around the house, to pleasuring their owner with his desires, no matter what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while the owner could eat the occasional disobedient and problematic pet or slave, no one else could touch it, let alone eat it, without the owner\u2019s consent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with the money his parents made from their jobs, John could have as many pets and slaves as he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, by the time he graduated from school, he had over one hundred of these so-called pets and slaves, most being fellow students he had saved from the stomachs of overzealous teachers, who were allowed to eat misbehaving or failing students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, due to his \u201cvegetarian\u201d ways, many humans and weaker monsters felt safe enough to even go to his home for the weekend, as his mother and father, due to their own human nature, rarely ate other sentient beings, aside from traveling salesmen and priests that didn\u2019t take the hints that his parents were not interested in buying anything or converting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, they would even go to the stockyards, were problematic kids were sold to, so they could be sold to restaurants and the like, buy up as many as they could, and then adopt them as their own, which was perfectly legal, if highly frowned upon by the rest of the monsters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the children tended to follow their rules, as most people bought from stockyards rarely got to live for more than a few days, before being eaten, unless they agreed to become that person\u2019s pet or slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn had gone to Harmony University, a place that had an important rule; both the staff and students were forbidden from eating others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a policy that was unheard of, but the headmaster, a dragon, would always reply, \u201cA live student paying his tuition is worth more than the most delicious feast.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile John didn\u2019t know if the headmaster preferred money over eating human flesh, or if he was a \u201cvegetarian\u201d like himself, he felt safe enough to go through collage in his human form, very rarely having to grow or shift into his werewolf form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during this time he decided to become a teacher, so he could teach others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he graduated, he found out that he had not only a teaching degree, but also one in philosophy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, when he got home, he received the news that his parents had died of old age. (They had had him relatively late in their lives.)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven he was their eldest child, as his aunts and uncles, that were full blooded werewolves or giants, made the claim that his so-called \u201colder siblings\u201d were just pets and slaves, which could only receive freedom upon their master\u2019s death, but nothing else, John found himself owner of all that his parents had owned, and very wealthy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, his parents had thought ahead and wrote in their respective wills that their spouse, or John, whichever was surviving, would inherit everything they had owned, as their full monster-blood relatives were, not only money grubbing, but very cruel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen John looked at the deed, he realized that he had more land than he knew what to do with. Half of it was wild and untamed, perfect for things like wild dear, rabbits, birds, and other things he preferred to eat, to live in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other half was a more recent purchase, an area that was mostly the sort of grass that one could find in their yards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he checked the land out, he was puzzled: Why would his parents spend so much money on a relatively poor area of land? There was no valuable wood in the forest; there were only trace amounts of precious mettles and minerals, hardly anything to justify even keeping it, except maybe farming it, but there was little to no profit in that. Besides, he had gone to collage to be a teacher, not a farmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day, while was checking out his parents\u2019 room, he found a journal. In it were ideas his father had wrote down, calculations for lengths of piping, wiring, plumbing, lumber and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it made no sense, until he saw a painting his mother had made. In it was a house up on a hill, surrounded by at least a dozen others. There was even a scene where children were playing, of all species, with parents watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he saw someone, who looked familiar. As he looked at the person, he gasped, it was him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he smiled, as he knew what his parents had wanted. While at first glance, the picture looked like a typical neighborhood, when one looked closer, especially in the eyes of the people, there was something extraordinary to be seen. These people had no fear of each other. A dragon was pushing a human on a swing set, a werewolf played cards with a cat-like creature (there are several types of those), and a harpy was playing hide and seek with a giant, were just a few of the things he saw. One other thing he saw was that various adult creatures were hunting for wild animals in the untamed area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message was loud and clear. He was to build a place were all could live in harmony, without any fear about getting eaten by their neighbors.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As usual, John found himself disgusted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese people hadn\u2019t just died; they were eaten, to satisfy the hunger of one monster or another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue he did eat people on occasion, but that was only to protect those he cared about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t even eat traveling salesmen and priests, though he did break their noses if they didn\u2019t get the hint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then read the academics page. Once again he found things that disgusted him, as the schools would say how many students failed the grade, never to try again, as they were either eaten or made into teachers\u2019 pets, literally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would even say how many students \u201cdisappeared\u201d during the year. The only blessing was that they wouldn\u2019t release the names of those who had \u201cfailed\u201d or \u201cdisappeared\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, John jerked his head up, as he heard the whine of machinery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he smiled as he got up and walked outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Howard,\u201d he said, as he walked towards the construction foreman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward, a saurian-like lizard that looked like a small T-Rex, turned and looked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he said. \u201cI never did understand why you had us sign that one contract. You know the one that prevented us from eating humans and others, while we were under contract.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just grinned, showing off his larger that normal canines. \u201cYou know how I feel about that sort of stuff,\" hesaid. \"And didn\u2019t I save that one cousin of yours in high school from that sort of fate?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, you claimed she was your new pet,\" Howard said. \"I heard about that through the gossip of some girls I was stalking. Why the mention of her name made me blow my cover before they were even an arm\u2019s length away.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John said, \u201cYah well, as long as I write your paychecks, you and your men will follow our agreement.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you are paying us triple wages. I guess that is more than enough of a reason to not eat human meat,\u201dHoward said, with a grin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Yah, well I best get going,\" John said. \"That boss of mine still doesn\u2019t get why I don\u2019t eat my problem students.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John grew to his maximum height and started walking towards town. As he left, Howard chuckled. Money was why he gave up human flesh. That and the food that John gave them happened to be even better.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As John got to the school, he shrank down to his human size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way there he had stopped a few thugs from harming a young woman. All he really did was just get and have them tied up and hang them upside-down from a few telephone posts. The woman had looked at him with a mixture of fear and hope. After recovering the woman\u2019s fallen groceries, John just smiled, with his lips, waved at her, and walked on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he entered the school, John heard a sound he knew quite well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy class better behave until I get there,\u201d he thought, as he turned towards the sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound got louder until he reached the janitor\u2019s closet. It was a mixture of slurping and muffled screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing to twelve feet tall and turning into his werewolf form, John grabbed the door and ripped it off of its hinges. In front of him was a startled kitsune, a fox-like creature, with a pair of human legs and feet sticking out of his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d John said, with a low growl in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust having some breakfast, sir,\u201d was the kitsune\u2019s muffled response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn also hears a low, muffled, cry for help coming from the throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a low growl, John grabs the kitsune by the scruff of his neck and picks them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he gently grabs the legs of the human and carefully pulls it out of the kitsune\u2019s mouth and throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looks the kitsune square in the eyes and tells him, \u201cUnless you want a tour of my digestive system, get to your classroom before the bell rings in forty-seven seconds.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then drops the kitsune and growls as he takes off. John then looks at the human and shakes his head in disgust. The human, a young naked girl, looks at him, with fear in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is your class this period?\u201d John asks, in a kind voice, as he sets the girl down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI d-d-don\u2019t g-g-go t-to s-s-c-chool h-h-here,\u201d the girl said, in a shaky voice. \u201cM-m-my p-p-parents, t-t-they s-s-sold m-m-me because I w-w-was s-s-spoi-l-l-ed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sighed, as he shifted back to his human form and smallest size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you best come with me,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m naked,\u201d the girl said, followed by a sneeze, \u201cand wet and cold to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn took a look in the closet and found some art smocks and a pair of overalls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing a couple of smocks and the overalls, John said, \u201cUse one of these smocks to dry yourself off and put the other one, as well as the overalls, on when you are done.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he turned around to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a minute after the bell for first period to start rang when John felt a small hand touch the back of his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe legs are a little long sir, and most of my back is exposed, along with some other things,\u201d said the girl as John turned around to face her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt could be worse,\u201d John said, as he kneeled down to get a better look at her. She looked to be about twelve years old with red hair and blue eyes, a rare combination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name young one?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJulia, Julia Sanders,\u201d said the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just chuckled as he carefully picked her up and said, \u201cWell Julia, my name is John Wolfstone, but you can call me John. Everyone else does.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks John, for saving me,\u201d the girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, well don\u2019t thank me yet,\" John said. \"Even if it is within my rights to take certain things from students, who take them out at the inappropriate times, a girl like you is worth a lot of money. I expect that boy\u2019s family may try to sue me.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When he got to his class, John set Julia in a seat next to his desk.  He then picked up some chalk and started writing the day\u2019s lessons on the board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was doing this, he heard a bunch of low chuckles coming from the front of the room, as well as some muffled cries of pain, and someone begging for help, from the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTawna Bloodwolf,\u201d he said, in a low, deep, and threatening voice. \u201cUnless you fancy hanging from the flagpole upside down, you have five seconds to cough Tiffany up starting now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gulp, followed by the sound of vomiting, followed by a loud plopping sound is heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe same goes for you as well Justian Orangefur,\u201d John said, as he turned his head to look at a rakshasa, a cat-like creature. \u201cCough Tom up, or else I will skin you alive and turn your fur into a rug.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then extends a six inch claw for emphases on his threat. With that, Justian sticks his fingers down his throat, in order to cause himself to vomit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter picking up the two saliva and stomach acid covered students, John turns to the rest and says, \u201cWell now, it looks like Tawna and Justian both have to spend a week under my supervision for their little stunts. Now, unless the rest of you would like to be in detention with Mrs. Clawfoot, you had best pay attention to what I am about to say, for I will quiz you when I am done.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the rest of the class to straighten up. If there was one teacher, besides Mr. Wolfstone, which was known for being the strictest with their students, it was Mrs. Clawfoot. She had the tendency to force misbehaving students onto the ground and stepping on them, digging her clawed feet into their backs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then turned to Tiffany and Tom and said, \u201cYou two don\u2019t have to listen to my lecture today, though, if you do, you won\u2019t have to go to Mrs. Clawfoot if you miss half or more of the questions. The score will be instead calculated and used for extra credit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair looked at each other, while the rest of the class just gasped. Mr. Wolfstone rarely, unlike most other teachers, gave out extra credit, even to those with good grades. The two students looked back at John and nodded. John smiled, as he gave each of them a towel and sent them over to a set of empty desks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as John was about to start his speech, the door opened up and in came Samual Redblood, a vampire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Samual, that\u2019s two detentions you owe me. The first for not going to detention last night and the second for showing up late today,\u201d Mr. Wolfstone said, with a bit of contempt in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamual stuck his middle finger up at him and said, \u201cShove it, vegetarian. I don\u2019t have to listen to you, weakling,\u201d as he kicked another student out of \u201chis\u201d seat. At this point, everyone cleared the area around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he wouldn\u2019t eat his students, as he followed the creed of his Alma martyr, Harmony U., Mr. Wolfstone was the last teacher you wanted to anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Redblood, tonight, after you serve today\u2019s detention, you have a special assignment,\u201d John said, with an evil grin on his face. \u201cYou are to interview your uncle Joseph and ask him how he faired in his fight with this \u2018vegetarian\u2019 when he was in the twelfth grade and I was in the seventh.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess, he kicked your ass,\u201d Samual said, sarcasticly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no,\" John said. \"I busted his skull wide open. I also broke six of his ribs, his arms and legs. I also did it with one blow, a round house kick to the chest, which sent him from the top floor of the school to the lobby of the hospital four miles east of here. I also did it in my human form as well. If you don\u2019t believe me, talk to Mrs. Clawfoot about it. I spent a month under her supervision for it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Samual gulped. Students under a teacher\u2019s supervision were treated as slaves until their time was up. Basically, whatever the teacher said, the student had to do, from cleaning out his septic system to sleeping in the same bed as him, where anything could happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John chuckled and said, \u201cOf course, receiving those injuries did him a bit of a favor. Mr. Snapjaw felt enough pity for him to not have him expelled and turned into fertilizer for the school grounds. Of course, Mr. Snapjaw knew me quite well, due to an incident in the fourth grade when I preformed the Heimlich maneuver on him, and busted a few of his ribs, when he was choking on a very problematic student of his. In fact, for saving his life, he let me keep it as a pet. Of course, it was that or risk being charged with assault, cause I did break his nose when he tried swallowing that student when I first saw him with that student\u2019s legs sticking out of his throat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, the class just looked at each other. It was very rare that a teacher, let alone a student, challenged the disciplinarian actions of another teacher, much less the principal. Mr. Snapjaw was a thirty foot tall T-Rex that everyone, including the teachers, obeyed. Otherwise, they would find themselves going down his throat, never to be seen again, until he went to use the bathroom. In order to avoid that fate, one either had to have some powerful connections, know one of his most embarrassing secrets, which would be revealed in the advent of some \u201cunforeseen\u201d or \u201cunfortunate\u201d incident, or know, or have, some very good tricks to getting out of someone\u2019s stomach alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, John had a very good trick, as no one, not even a giant, could survive something growing from 7ft 5in to 100ft while in that person\u2019s stomach. It was a trick he had only used once before, and that was to save the life of him, and his one new found friend. After that incident, hardly anyone would dare to bother him, or those he cared about. Why, even the teachers had a slight fear of him, all except for Mrs. Clawfoot. She knew why John acted the way he did, as she had had his mother as a teacher in high school.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the day was over, and the students that survived their classes were let out, John was walking through the hallway. In his arms was a sleeping Julia, who had a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing behind them was Justian and Tawna, who was a dog-like werewolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students' eyes kept looking at Julia, with hunger in them. John just growled when he noticed this, slightly disturbing Julia\u2019s nap, but not enough to wake her up, so he hummed a quiet, soothing tune he had learned from his mother, causing her to fall back into a deeper slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then saw someone that caused him to smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Janus,\u201d he said, in his normal human voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the sight of Janus Clawfoot caused Justain and Tawna to almost wet their pants in fear. At ten feet tall, Mrs. Clawfoot was a harpy no student dared to anger. Of course John knew her public attitude was a bit of an act, because in reality, her shriek was sharper than her beak. It was also rare that she actually ate any of her students, as, for the most part, they ended up in her crop. About the worst she did was just get a grab of the problem student, with her feet, and sink her talons into the person\u2019s back, after forcing him to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanus looked at them and smiled. \u201cWell this must be the breakfast you confiscated from James Twotail. No wonder he kept complaining, until I swallowed him. Then again, he was five seconds late to class.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just chuckled. \u201cWell keep him for a week or two,\u201d he said. \u201cThat way I don\u2019t have to worry about his parents trying to sue me for confiscating their purchase for their son\u2019s breakfast.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you and your soft spot for humans, that will get you into trouble someday,\u201d Janus said, with a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, human is in my blood, and I\u2019d rather get in trouble for that than hearing my parents shout down at me from heaven,\u201d John said, with a smile, as he looked at Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess if you didn\u2019t stop him, he would have been later to class than he was,\" said Janus. \"However, the janitor was highly displeased to see the door ripped off of the hinges and his favorite pair of overalls missing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell him to lock the door so students don\u2019t try to hide in there next time,\" John said. \"Well, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow Janus. Oh and if you see Samual Redblood outside of your detention room and in the halls, slap him with three nights detention and I\u2019d like you to tell him about that fight I had with his uncle Joseph anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\" Janus said. \"That boy needs to be knocked down a perch or two.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John smiled as he walked out the door. Even if he couldn\u2019t stop people from eating humans, he would at least save the ones he could, and hope it would cause others to do the same.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tawna and Justian gasped as they saw this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you afford construction on this scale?\u201d they asked. \u201cAnd why would you build so many different sized houses?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple really,\" John said. \"Not only were my parents quite wealthy, I was named their heir. Also, this sort of thing was something of a small dream of theirs, for me to be a landlord. Each house is designed to accommodate a, relatively, large family, with more than enough room to spare for pets, slaves, and of course, guests.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTawna and Justian just looked at each other in amazement. They had known that Mr. Wolfstone was a little bit weird, due to his human blood, but this seemed to be just plain crazy. Of course, just when things couldn\u2019t seem to get any crazier, they did.</span></div></div>",

They were at least fifty feet tall, each. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked down at John and said, with a bit of contempt in his voice, \u201cDo you know where John Wolfstone is, human?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John just gave an evil grin and said, \u201cIf you want to do business with him, you best ask me both nicely, and politely, otherwise, you will be forced to leave.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the man gave a low, deep, and angry, growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dare this human speak down to me,\u201d he mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, however, then asked, with a voice that sounded as if she was offering a child candy, \u201cDo you know where he is? We are here to rent one of his houses for our family to live at.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s much better.\u201d John said, as he grew one hundred feet tall and shifted into his werewolf form at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair looked up at him and gasped. It was a rare thing to be a size-changer, let alone a size-changing werewolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then gulped. The \u201chuman\u201d he had insulted, was really the owner of a house that he hoped to rent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at him and said, \u201cI am willing to let bygones be bygones, if you learn to think before you act or say something stupid. I have certain rules on my land, rules that everyone is to follow. The first is \u2018Treat others the way you want to be treated.\u2019 The rest are in the contract you and your wife will have to sign in order to live on my property. I will expect you to read the entire thing, including some very fine print; otherwise you will suffer the consequences. Now go around back where there is a table for you to sit in. I will be out in a moment.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John shrank down and shifted back into his human form and then led his two students into the house, still carrying a still sleeping Julia.</span></div></div>",

He knew that the girl had had, at least, one very rough week. Her parents had sold her to a stockyard, which sold her as food to some monsters, nearly eaten by one, but then rescued by another that saw her as a person instead of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked out of the room, John saw his students watching him with a question in their eyes: Why? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at them and said, \u201cThe lesson for you this week is to find out, for yourselves, is this: Is one person\u2019s race superior to another\u2019s? When this week is over, you are to write a summery of your experiences with someone you would normally consider prey, a human. That human is the one who is currently sleeping. She will be your responsibility. If anything bad happens to her, both of you will have failed the class, especially if it is your fault. Also, you will only eat what I tell you to eat, because, until this week is over, you two will be \u2018vegetarians\u2019. If I find out you ate a sentient being, without a justifiable cause, to me, both of you, even if only one of you did the deed, will have failed the class. However, I will make at least one exception: If someone tries to harm or eat Julia, you two have my permission to do whatever is necessary to protect her, including eating that person. If you can\u2019t do it, one of you is to follow that person while the other comes to get me for help. If you do that, things will go smoothly for all of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John disappeared into his office to get some paperwork for the perspective couple outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustian and Tawna looked at each other. A human was asleep in the room before them and they couldn\u2019t even have a taste of it. Instead they had to protect it, as if it was one of them. Also, if anything happened to it, they would be in big trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Justian asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we should listen to Mr. Wolfstone and do as he tells us,\" Tawna said. \"My father fought him once and lost when they were in the tenth grade. He told me that the reason Mr. Wolfstone didn\u2019t eat him was because he said that dog meat gave him really bad gas.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father\u2019s right about that one!\u201d John shouted from his office. \u201cDog meat does give me gas! But the reason I fought him was because he tried to eat this elf girl I had a crush on! Admittedly I can\u2019t remember her name anymore, but the point was to protect her from him!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, John opened the door to his office and stepped out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is something you must learn as well, protect those you care about with everything you\u2019ve got,\u201d John said. \u201cNow, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ve got something to do.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides, it\u2019s not like we have much choice. After all, it\u2019s this or living with my parents, and I know that you don\u2019t like living there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, how I wish that our house hadn\u2019t gone up in flames, considering that we don\u2019t have any money to get it rebuilt. Then again, we just couldn\u2019t afford the insurance,\u201d the man said, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, John cleared his throat and said, \u201cI\u2019d hate to interrupt any conversation you to might be having, but, as you can see, I have some forms for you to look over and sign if you wish to live here. Of course, before you do that, let me show you one of the finished homes I have for people of your size. That way you will know what you could get before you even pay a thing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John increased his height to fifty feet and took them to one of the houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can see,\" John said, after he lead the couple on a tour of the on house for giants of their size. \"Everything, from the floor beams to the bathroom sink is made of high quality materials. Now mind you, I had the same done for all the houses on my land, all made exactly the same way, except for size of course. About the only thing you, or anyone else who moves in, have to do is pick the color to make the walls, inside and out, and carpet for the floor, and shingles for the roof, all of which will be done by professionals, at no extra expense for you, or anyone else.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, that IS a good deal!\u201d the woman said, excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what\u2019s the catch?\u201d the man asked, cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple really,\" John said. \"You just have to follow the rules, which are the same for anyone planning to rent a home here. Also, and this is the big thing, you, and anyone else who moves here, will not be allowed to eat anyone while you live on my land. This rule will also extend to anyone that also lives under your roof or is a guest for the night. Failure to follow this rule, even when you go on vacation or business trips, could result in, at the very least, being evicted from my property. You will leave everything that\u2019s in the house, in the house, from electronics, to vehicles, and even, your pets and slaves. Also, while we are on that subject, your will treat your pets and slaves as if they were family members, from clothing them, to feeding them adequate food, and so on.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not fair. What would we eat then?\u201d the couple asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy,\" John said. \"I have an area set up so you, and others, can go hunting for wild animals.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou expect us to be \u2018vegetarians\u2019!\u201d the man said, with anger in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you decide to live here,\u201d John said, calmly. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s a cheap price to pay in order to get a high quality home at an affordable price.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he made a few slow motions with his head, as if he was looking for someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he whispered, in a conspiratorially-like voice, \u201cOf course there is always the occasional traveling salesman or priest that doesn\u2019t take \u2018No\u2019 for an answer. I might look the other way if one of those \u2018disappeared\u2019 from time to time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the man gave a deep throated chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see what you mean,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what if someone tried to break in?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHand them over to me, and by the time I\u2019m done with them, they won\u2019t even want to look at anything valuable,\" John said, with a chuckle. \"Though if they seriously harm you or someone you care about, do whatever you want to them and don\u2019t say a thing cause that is one time I would eat someone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas that ever happened?\u201d the woman asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not in my house, but it does occur every so often on my way to work,\" the the size-changing werewolf said. \"Then again, given my rearing, the university I went to, and the job I\u2019ve got, I hate it when someone, and I don\u2019t care who it is, tries to eat a child. Now an older person, well, I might let that slide, but for someone to just eat a child, not while I\u2019m around. After all, they have their lives ahead of them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, John handed the pair the forms and said, \u201cRead those tonight. If you are still interested in living here after that, come tomorrow afternoon when I get home from work.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then walked out the door and went to his house.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He lowered his head and let out a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked out the window to see the building the construction crew was digging the foundation for. It was something that would be his personal touch for the place. Everything else, even if there were a few additions to the original idea, was part of his parents\u2019 dream. To him it was the one thing that had been missing from the painting, a place of learning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked towards the living room and saw Tawna and Justian standing in the doorway between it and the dining room and kitchen, where he was at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the clock and said, \u201cLooks like I best get supper ready. Now do you remember what I said?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mr. Wolfstone,\u201d Justian said. \u201c\u2018Eat only what I tell you to.\u2019\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now I\u2019m going to get Julia up and get her some proper clothes,\" John said. \"Now, Ms. Tawna, you are to help her get dressed, and if anything should happen...?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\" Tawna said, with something of a low sigh of annoyance. \"Both me and Justian fail the class.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you remember that,\" John said. \"Now, if you get bored while you are here, I do have books you can read, some games you can play, and a few decks of cards you can use, and I expect you to also play with Julia. It will help you learn about her and what she has gone through. Also, at night, I want you to think about what she tells you and try to imagine yourself in those sorts of situations. You may find that you have some things in common with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John went upstairs, with Tawna following him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went into the guestroom, set on the edge of the bed and gently tapped Julia\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sleeping beauty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to get up and dressed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Julia gave a low groan as she opened her eyes and sat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when she saw Tawna, Julia went rigid with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cK-k-kit-s-s-sune,\u201d she said, her jaw chattering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then said, in a low voice, that Julia couldn\u2019t hear, but Tawna would, \u201cTawna, I want you to shift into your human form and turn the light on.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he said in a voice that Julia could hear, \u201cWhy Tawna, why don\u2019t you turn the light on? It is a little dark in here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned his head to look at her, with a cold look in his eyes to silence any complaints Tawna had about shifting into her human form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight away Mr. Wolfstone,\u201d she said, shifting into her human form just as she flicked the light switch next to the door. The sudden change from pitch black darkness to bright light forced Julia to shut her eyes, to protect them, temporarily, giving Tawna enough time to finish shifting into her human form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, there Julia. There are no kitsunes in my home at the moment,\u201d John said, as he comforted Julia in her moment of fear. \u201cHowever, Tawna is a werewolf, so you might see her in that form, from time to time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at Tawna and nodded, giving permission for her to turn back into that form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a part of who she is.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what about you?\u201d Julia asked. \u201cAren\u2019t you a werewolf as well?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John gave a light chuckle. \u201cActually,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a bit more complicated than that. You could say I\u2019m a size changer who can shift into the form of a werewolf between the heights of ten and one hundred feet tall.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. I\u2019ve never even heard of someone like that,\u201d Julia said, with admazement in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because giants and werewolves rarely fall for one another, John said. 'Of course, when my parents found out that the person that they had a crush on, each other, while writing to a student from another school, didn\u2019t eat humans too often and that both were half human, they decided to meet up at a, relatively, small dinner that was close to both of them. The only clues they had about each other was that they would wear similar colored outfits, a red top with a blue bottom. Needless to say, they were very surprised when they saw each other that night. Of course, it was also love at first sight as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just smiled as he remembered what his parents had told him about that day, his father, with his sleek jet black fur coat and his mother, with her soft brown eyes and light brown curly hair and naturally red lips. It was like a story that was too fantastic to even be fiction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there were some problems with their parents when they saw the other person, but, then again, what couple didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple had married a few years later, much to the disbelief of everyone who had attended the wedding, including the priest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more astonishing was the rules they had for those attending the wedding and the reception. They practically threatened to eat anyone, including the priest, if they even tried to eat someone, guest or otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey even went so far as to claim those, which their relatives had snuck in as snacks, as wedding presents for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only real problem John\u2019s parents had had was having children of their own. The doctors always came back with negative results every time they tried to get their assistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was depressing for them until one day, John\u2019s father saw several children on sale at a stockyard. These were older ones who had had no real chance for adoption. Despite his personal ideas about the practice of selling disruptive children as food, John\u2019s father saw this as an opportunity for him and his wife to have children that they could raise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went and bought them and took them home, where he explained to his wife the reason for his purchase. After that, at every chance they got, they would buy up as many children as they could, saving them from fates they did not deserve. Then, after forty years of marriage, John\u2019s mother got the shock of her life, she was pregnant with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this news hadn\u2019t stopped his parents from buying children and giving them second chances.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the present, John gave a happy sigh. His father\u2019s heart had been as big as his mother, whose heart had nothing to be compared to, in levels of their kindness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at Julia and said, \u201cTawna will help you get dressed. I will have supper ready in an hour. Now don\u2019t you worry, I was raise to think of humans as equals, and not meals. Now I will admit that I have had human meat in the past, but, for the most part, that was because I was protecting someone from that particular human. Only once did I eat human meat as part of a meal, and that was by accident. Ugh, it made me feel so sick, when my cousin told me what it was, that I threw up on his wife\u2019s lap, and that was when I was seven years old. After that, the mere sight of someone eating a human, alive or otherwise made me sick. I even feel sick when I eat one that tries to kill a friend of mine. Needless to say, while I know all the tricks to hunting humans and the like, I tended to spend more time befriending them than actually hunting them, which didn\u2019t make my teachers very happy. But then again, after a certain incident in the fifth grade, no one tried to make me eat the humans I had caught for my assignments in that sort of class.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they try Mr. Wolfstone?\u201d Tawna asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that, when the teacher tried making me late for my twelfth birthday, as well as the one of the human I had caught, I discovered my size changing abilities and he became late for his fiftieth birthday and his thirtieth anniversary,\" John said, with a low sigh. \"Guy died from a very bad stomachache.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Tawna\u2019s eyes bulged and the skin under her fur paled, while John gave a low, nervous, chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot the happiest moment of my life,\u201d he said, as he left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, Justian came into the kitchen, sniffing the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he said, \u201cHey, what are you cooking? It smells delicious.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just smiled and said, \u201cLet\u2019s just say that when you try my stew, you will take it over human flesh every time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Justian asked, \u201cWell, what\u2019s in it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe basic recipe is meat, potatoes, carrots, and seasonings,\" John said, with a smile. \"The rest is up to the cook, the type of meat, potatoes, carrots, seasonings, and any additions they wish to put in it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen will it be ready?\u201d the boy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be ready in about half an hour,\" John said. \"If you want to, you can go help set the table. Plates and cups are in the cupboard to your right and the silverware is in the drawer to the left of it. Make sure you get enough for all four of us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John turned around to add some things to the stew. He then heard the cupboard door squeaking and plates clinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember what I said Justian,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be four people eating at the table, not three, unless you want to give your plate to Julia and starve tonight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the plates started clinking again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he said, \u201cThe same also goes for the cups and silverware as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mr. Wolfstone,\" Justian said, with some annoyance in his voice. \"I heard you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, Tawna walks down the stairs, with Julia following her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at the young girl and smiled. She looked very pretty to him. She also had a smile on her face, as if she had had a dream come true, which had probably happened, as it was rare that humans made much money cause they tended to get low paying jobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the only way could get a good paying job was if they were a wizard or something like that. Then again, humans that had high paying jobs were protected by law. To eat one of those ones was a death sentence. As a result, someone, like a highly successful plastic surgeon, was not at as much risk of being eaten, unlike someone like a plumber that was new to the job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a bad job you did Tawna, helping Julia get dressed,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe looks nice,\u201d Justian said. \u201cAnd deli- (At that point Mr. Wolfstone took a cold glance at him) -I-I-I mean beautiful.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then took the lid off of the stew and, using a spoon, tasted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSupper\u2019s ready,\u201d he said, taking the pot off of the stove, after turning it off, and setting it on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Boy I\u2019m starving!\u201d Justian blurted out as he reached for the pot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Mr. Wolfstone smacked his hand with the ladle, causing him to whimper in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat hurts,\u201d he said, clutching his wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I say you could eat it?\u201d John asked, with a cold look in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo sir, you did not, Mr. Wolfstone,\u201d Justian said, as he lowered his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\" John said, as he sat down. \"Now let\u2019s have a little discussion amongst ourselves before we eat. Tawna, how many immediate family members do you have living with you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, there\u2019s me, my mother, my father, my one older sister and three younger brothers,\u201d the dog-like werewolf said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Justian,\" John said, looking at the tiger-like rakasha. \"I have the same question for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be my mother, my stepfather, my stepbrother, and my two half-sisters,\u201d the boy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let me ask both of you this question, what do you think they are thinking right now, now that you are not home with them?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm I don\u2019t know,\u201d Justian said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think my younger brothers are making a mess in my room,\u201d said Tawna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I know this much, your parents are scared about what I could do to you,\u201d said John, as he got up and started filling their plates with food. \u201cEveryone fears having someone taken away and misses them when they are gone, if they truly care about that person. Now eat up, desert will be here in a little while. I had to order out for it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John picked up his fork and started eating his stew. Then Julia tried some and her eyes beamed with excitement at the taste. However, Tawna and Justian couldn\u2019t really taste it, as their minds were on their teacher\u2019s words, that their parents were scared about what could happen to them. They were the same way when desert arrived, cake and ice cream. Needless to say, Julia was very happy. Later that night, after he had tucked Julia into bed, John went into his room to rest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately, an old nightmare of his showed up. In it, he was in a blood-soaked street, running in fear for his life. There were others running as well, with someone screaming every so often. Finally, it was down to him and his pursuer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you running? Turn and face your fate,\u201d said a deep and malevolent voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only caused John to run faster, until he tripped on someone\u2019s torn leg. When he tried to get up, he found himself stuck to the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the voice said, \u201cTired, why don\u2019t you rest in my stomach.\u201d At that point, a large fur covered hand with long sharp claws grabbed and picked him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John found himself, face to face with the worst monster he knew of, his giant werewolf form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are the same, you and I,\u201d said the giant werewolf. \u201cSo why do you run from me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you are nothing more than a flesh eating monster that eats people for the thrill of it,\u201d John shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell in that case,\u201d the giant werewolf said. \u201cI shall enjoy feasting upon your flesh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the monster tossed John into the back of his mouth and down his throat, where he started screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just before he woke up in a cold sweat, John heard the giant werewolf say, \u201cYou can\u2019t run from what you are, he that tries to runs from his love of the taste of human flesh.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs John opened his eyes, he gasped for air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was just a dream John,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cThat monster was not you. You wouldn\u2019t do those sorts of things. That isn\u2019t you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then got up out of bed and headed in the direction of the bathroom, so he could take a cold shower. It was just the thing he needed to clear his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, on his way there, he saw that the door to Julia\u2019s room was wide open. As he went to close it, he saw the moonlight shining on her face. He smiled as he saw this and started to go into the room, so he could replace a fallen sheet, when it happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth started to drool and he started licking his lips. Then his body started to grow, as well as shift into his werewolf form, and his thoughts started to change from replacing the sheet to placing Julia into a sack and tossing her into the oven and roasting her slowly and then enjoying her deliciously tasty flesh all to his own self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as he was about to grab her, John stepped on the one loose board in the whole room. The sound not only snapped him back to reality, but it caused Julia to start to wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at John, her eyes still sleepy, and said, \u201cMr. John, why are you in my room?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John quickly ran out of the room into the bathroom and slammed the door shut, which caused both Tawna and Justian to wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got out of their respective rooms and into the hallway, they saw Julia standing in front of the bathroom, with a puzzled look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at them and said, \u201cI think there might be something wrong with Mr. John. He\u2019s in there crying and talking to himself and he told me to stay away from him just now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tawna got to the door, she knocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo away Julia. You\u2026 have to\u2026 stay\u2026 away\u2026 from\u2026 me\u2026 right\u2026 now,\u201d said a low, and ragged, voice, which was also breathing, heavily, as if someone had been doing some very difficult and rigorous exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Wolfstone, it\u2019s me, Tawna,\u201d Tawna said, worriedly. \u201cAre you all right in there?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2019m not,\" John said, still breathing heavilly. \"You must keep Julia away from me, for her safety, right now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d the young werewolf asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember when said that I get sick when I eat human meat?\u201dJohn asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I remember,\u201d Tawna said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t the meat that makes me sick,\" John said, as his voice got deeper. \"No, I LOVE to EAT It! The Flavor, That Juicy Breast, The Firm Buttocks, Those Succulent Thighs and Legs, Oh I Love All of it!!!!!!! If I wanted to, I would eat it everyday and never get sick of it at all!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the three young ones backed away from the door, Julia scared about what she had heard from the person who had saved her life, and Tawna and Justian were shocked that their \u201cvegetarian\u201d teacher actually loved the taste of human flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever,\u201d John said, as his voice became normal. \u201cThe thing that stops me from doing that, and causes me to get sick, is guilt. It is the guilt of, in order for me to fulfill that craving; I would have to take someone\u2019s life. The guilt of someone never being able to see that person they cared about again. The guilt of, that in order to satisfy my desire, I\u2019d have to take away someone\u2019s hopes and dreams.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the young ones heard a heavy thud, causing the floor to vibrate, and some very heavy crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJulia, you don\u2019t know how close you were to being killed by my own hands,\" John said, with sobbing in his voice. \"If I hadn\u2019t stepped on that board I would of- OHMYGOD!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, some quick heavy footfalls and the sound of vomiting is heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia swallows her throat and nervously opens the bathroom door. She sees John in the form she first saw him in, a werewolf, but easily twenty feet tall. His mouth is in the bathtub, where he is puking his guts out and his eyes are shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, he turned his head and saw her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out of here!\u201d he shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe for you to be near me when I\u2019m like this! I\u2019m nothing more than a blood thirsty monster that hungers for the taste of human flesh! No matter how much I try to deny it, there is a monster deep inside me who would like nothing better that to grab you, stuff you down my throat and eat you alive!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then clutched the sides of the bathtub, causing it to bend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Julia tentatively walked up to him and wrapped her arms as best as she could around his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a monster,\u201d she said softly. \u201cA monster wouldn\u2019t have bothered to save my life. A monster would not have put my safety before his personal desires. He would not have tried to keep me safe from himself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John looked at her and asked, \u201cDo you really mean that? You don\u2019t think I\u2019m a monster?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Julia to smile and shake her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John sighed and sat down on the floor. He then placed his arms around the girl and held her to his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cNot many people would have said that if they saw me like this. Some would have run, others would have laughed, but none would have come up to me and comfort me when I needed it. It\u2019s hard to fight something that is in you so you can be who you are. It\u2019s even harder when that something is a small but powerful part of your being.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John started to cry on Julia\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you forgive me for even attempting such a dreadful thing?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou saved my life,\u201d Julia said. \u201cNot only did you save me from that kitsune, but from yourself, so yah, I forgive you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John sighed, and started to shrink down and become more human-like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you back to bed,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the morning I need to set up an appointment so that I can legally adopt you. That way those kitsunes won\u2019t be able to sue me for rescuing you from their son.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he stood up and walked out of the bathroom, into the room Julia had been sleeping in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he set her back into bed, John kissed her and said, \u201cSleep tight, my brave little princess. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got out of the room and shut the door, John saw his two students behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at them and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to hear about what you two saw in the bathroom. Not only would most people not understand the reasons as to why I want to keep it quiet, it would give them something to try and use against me. Being called and considered a \u2018vegetarian\u2019 would be innocent compared to what I\u2019d be called after that. Now go to your rooms and try to get some sleep, you have school in the morning.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two young ones nodded and went back to their rooms as John went to his. As he went to sleep, John had a pleasant and peaceful dream with Julia in it. While he would be unable to remember the exact details in the morning, it was the most wonderful thing he had ever experienced.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the morning, he woke up with the sun in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemind me to close the shades tonight,\u201d he said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then got his clothes, the type that a shape-shifter would wear, which wouldn\u2019t rip or burst when he shifted into his werewolf form or grew to the height of a giant, as it would adjust to fit any shape and form, expensive but worth it, and went to take his shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stepped inside, John saw the damage he had caused. While it wasn\u2019t much, the claw marks on the doorframe, the indentations of his feet in the floor, and the bent siding on his bathtub were more than enough to remind him about what nearly happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank God for loose floorboards,\u201d he said to himself as he took his sleeping outfit off and turned the shower on. The damage could be repaired, with the bathtub being replaced, but a person couldn\u2019t. That was one of the things his parents had told his throughout his childhood. A picture could be taped up, a wood piece glued, a glass replaced, but not even the most powerful of magic could bring the dead back to true life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was something he knew quite well, which was why John always wondered why others couldn\u2019t see this. At one point, he had thought about killing himself, so he could escape all that senseless stupidity and ignorance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he realized that as a teacher, he could influence young people, which was why he pursued those university classes that would allow his to achieve that goal. Now he had a real chance to teach others what he had learned. Those two students of his would only be the beginning of a whole new world, hopefully, although he wouldn\u2019t mind it if the credit went to someone else, like the headmaster of Harmony University. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it was only for financial reasons, his policy for forbidding staff and students from eating those enrolled at the place was able to keep over ninety percent of the human students that would have been otherwise eaten relatively safe while there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow if only some money grubbing politician realized that,\u201d John mumbled to himself as he got out of the shower and got dressed. Oh well, a \u201cvegetarian\u201d could dream about it anyways. He then went and woke up the others, so they could take their showers, get dressed and have breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the young ones were getting ready, John was on the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshwood County Courthouse,\u201d said a high pitch female voice. \u201cThis is Secretary Gina Firetongue speaking.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah um can you get me the Adoption Agency Center?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the reason that you want to talk to them about?\u201d the woman asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a child I\u2019d like to adopt,\u201d John replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you acquire this child?\u201d The woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you like to know this?\" John asked. \"She\u2019s a young girl who deserves someone who cares about her well being.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir\" the woman said. \"But due to certain policies, if the child was sold and bought from a stockyard, he or she is not allowed to be adopted by the person who bought him or her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, and you ought to know that,\" John said, angerly. \"Every child deserves a second chance, even those who are troublemakers. My own parents bought children from stockyards and adopted them, starting way before I was even born.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\" the woman said. \"Well these policies were put in place after a giantess and werewolf couple known as Wolfstone-Megagain were found to have adopted more than seven hundred in that manner.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s were you are wrong,\u201d John said.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!?\u201d the woman said, with a loud voice, obviously wondering who she was talking to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey adopted eight hundred thirty-four boys and girls who deserved another chance,\u201d John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know this?\" the woman asked, wondering how someone knew such informantion. \"That knowledge is not available to the public.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\" John said. \"But as their only biological child, I should know how many stepbrothers and sisters I\u2019ve had!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John slammed his phone down on its receiver, severing the connection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it,\u201d he said under his breath, angrily. \u201cWhat am I going to do now? It\u2019s not like I can just claim she is a witch with weak magical abilities so she can be adopted by me. Anyone with even weak amounts of real magic could see she doesn\u2019t have any in her. Also, I can\u2019t say she\u2019s a pet, cause then she\u2019d have to wear a collar, get shots done, have a leash, and then she\u2019d also have to be naked all the time. No she wouldn\u2019t like that. About the only way I\u2019d be able to keep her is if the laws changed, but that wouldn\u2019t happen, unless\u2026. No that\u2019s too radical and too violent for me to do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he saw Julia sitting down at the table with Tawna and Justian having breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe I should,\u201d he said, with a grin. \u201cIf only for their sakes, as well as those born in the future.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then picked up the phone and made a call to a number he would call every so often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\" said an older woman's voice. \"This is the Clawfoot residence, Janus speaking.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Janus,\" John said. \"I need to talk to you about something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, I was just about to call you,\" the harpy said. \"Given your soft spot for humans, I figured you might like to adopt that one child, so I called up a friend of mine at the adoption center. In a round about way, I asked her if someone could adopt a child that had been sold to and bought from a stockyard and do you know what she told me? She told me it was against their policy to allow such things to happen. So I did a bit of digging at City Hall, with another friend of mine, and do you know what I found with your name written all over it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess,\" John said, clentching his fist. \"A law passed shortly after the deaths of my parents preventing others from doing what they did.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, how did you know?\u201d Janus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI made a phone call asking if I could adopt a girl I had acquired,\" John said. \"Now, I didn\u2019t say how I got her, but when they asked how and they told me about this policy that was created after my parents\u2019 deaths, let\u2019s just say I hung up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh John, what are you going to do?\u201d Janus asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a plan,\" John said. \"But I need you to do me a few favors.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what are they?\u201d the harpy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, I need you to take some students of mine to school and find someone you trust to keep an eye on my class.\u201d said John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay and the other one?\u201d the woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf my plan doesn\u2019t work out, I would deeply appreciate it if you were to take care of Julia for me,\u201d John said, with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, what are you thinking about doing?!?!\u201d the woman asked, with worry in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say, the less I say the better, for you and Julia, especially if this doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d  John said, as he hung up the phone and started to take the young ones over to Janus\u2019s place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got there, John started to leave when Janus asked again, \u201cJohn, what are you going to do?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to create a world where people can grow up without fear of their neighbors. A place in where parents don\u2019t have to worry about their kids getting eaten by other people. A place in which a child can go home and they know that their parents won\u2019t sell them, just for being a little disobedient. A place were children can go to school and learn without the fear of being eaten because they got the lowest score on the test, or because they get bad grades in school, or that their fellow classmates will eat them for lunch. I\u2019m going to carry out my parents\u2019 dream on a scale they never even thought possible, and cause a world wide revolution of thinking and living.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then handed Janus a painting. \u201cThat was made by my mother. I think you\u2019ll understand when you look at it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he said; \u201cBesides, if those people want me to be a monster, I\u2019ll show them one that they\u2019ll never forget, ever.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, John began to grow, taller than he\u2019d ever been, and become more wolf than even most werewolves dared become. By the time he was done changing, nothing even looked remotely human, even his shape shifting clothing gave out, and he was on all fours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned towards the city, as Janus lived on the outskirts, and howled loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he started running faster than anyone even thought possible.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If I were you, I\u2019d make sure I\u2019d call every news network I\u2019d know and get them here, as well as wake up every high ranking politician I knew.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John sat down to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the hour, virtually everyone for miles around was glued to their radios and televisions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of reporters and journalists converged upon the scene as fast as they could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time ever, a person most would have thought wanted to eat every single human he saw was speaking out in favor of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany were at the various buildings that had been destroyed, interviewing witnesses, dodging the occasional piece of masonry hurled at those who tried recapturing the people that had been held at those \u201cplaces of  murder\u201d, as John had called them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, most everyone in the city was standing around the center of it, watching John as he sat there, watching and waiting for something, or someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear him was the shattered remains of the roofs he had torn off, hurling a piece every so often towards where the stockyards and certain restaurants once stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his eyes was a look of immense coldness directed towards certain people and places. No one escaped his gaze, not even those who were in the shadows of various places, usually because they couldn\u2019t survive being in the sunlight, not because they were doing something illegal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Janus had just landed on the rooftop of a building some distance away from the scene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy God John, what have you done?\u201d she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then bent over and vomited something up, it was Julia. She had wanted to go to John when she saw him on the television, so Janus had placed her in her crop and flew as close as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there were too many people on the roofs closer to John than she felt comfortable bringing someone up around than she preferred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Janus asked. \u201cCrop travel is not exactly comfortable.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through worse,\u201d Julia said as she walked close to the edge of the roof. \u201cBesides, John\u2019s been there for me. I want to be there for him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know he\u2019s doing this not only for you but for all humans,\u201d Janus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\" Julia said. \"But this was all because I showed up in someone\u2019s mouth yesterday. If I hadn\u2019t showed up-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe would have done this anyways,\" Janus said. \"It\u2019s in his blood. His parents, may they rest in peace, were, not only half human, and mostly vegetarian, they were part of an underground movement that sought equality for humans, even those without magic.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d Julia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m part of it myself,\" Janus said, as she looked at John. \"However, our numbers are small, maybe a few hundred thousand throughout the world, and we are always being watched, if only to make sure we don\u2019t do anything that would jeopardize how the governments and such run. John though, as much as he would hate to admit it, would not make a good member of our group. For one thing, he has a very long record of assaulting people that were just \u2018following their stomachs\u2019, as it were, and saving humans from them. Of course with this stunt, he may achieve the goal we have been striving for, equality for all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Julia asked,\u201cCan you take me to him?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d the harpy asked, looking back at the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe needs someone beside him now,\" Julia said. \"Otherwise something really bad could happen to him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what could be worse than being at the top of the majority of most countries Most Wanted lists,\" Janus said. \"But, in a way, his caring for you, as a fatherly figure, might finally drive home the point that our group has been trying to make for years, that people that are not humans can get along with those that aren\u2019t, without any blood being shed in the process. Now hold on, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done what I\u2019m about to do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say we are going to go parasailing,\" Janus said. \"So when I grab your shoulders, grab onto my ankles as best as you can.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Janus quickly ran to the other side of the roof and jumped off, spreading her wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she came back up and grabbed Julia by her shoulders. The girl, more by instinct than anything else, grabbed onto Janus\u2019s ankles, for fear of falling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Janus soar close to John, he looked at them in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJanus,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat in the hell are you doing here? You should be at the school keeping an eye on Julia!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was,\" Janus said. \"But when Mr. Snapjaw saw you on the news, well, someone wanted me to take her to you. Now hold your hand out, my wings are getting tired and I\u2019m not as young as I used to be.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John held his hand out and felt something settle on it, a moment before Janus herself landed on one of his shoulders. As John looked at his hand, he saw a somewhat damp Julia looking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to even ask you how you got here,\u201d John said as he raised his hand and carefully pressed it against his chest. \u201cBut I am glad you are here with me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as he felt Julia hug him, as best as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want to lose the only one that seems to actually care about me as a person,\u201d said Julia, her voice somewhat muffled, and sobbing as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how you feel Julia. However, unless certain things change, people like you and me will not be allowed to call each other equals. That and there is a law preventing me from adopting you, due to your previous situation that caused you to meet me,\u201d John said, as large tears rolled down his face and land just bellow his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a deep voice said, \u201cFinally, someone that understands why I abandoned this world, though I did have hope that things would change on this planet for the better, eventually anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John lifted his head and said, \u201cWho said that, show yourself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax my child,\u201d said the voice. \u201cI am not here to harm you or any of my children, nor do I wish them to harm those who are also my favored children whom I\u2019ve gifted with the ability to think for their own selves, and not just follow instincts.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you are not here to harm us, why don\u2019t you show yourself instead of hiding?\u201d asked John, who was suspicious of this voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe what I just told you?\u201d the voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was raised not to take things at face value,\" John said, looking for the owner of the voice. \"Instead, I was to look for the real truth behind someone\u2019s words, and find the meaning behind them. And besides, I\u2019d be a fool to just trust what someone, who I don\u2019t know, with what they say. Also, I don\u2019t know you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a deep throated laughter is heard. \u201cThose are wise words, my child.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The figure\u2019s form kept changing as well, looking like a giant human one moment, to a werewolf the next, to a dragon after that, and so forth. However, it was always female, humanoid, and, at least, several thousand feet tall. Also, no matter where she stood, whether she stepped on something, like a building, or a bunch of people even, she caused no harm or damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at John, and said; because he had a look of worry when he saw her place her feet near some children, \u201cI made sure that I would be unable to harm my children when I first created them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was soft and soothing, so soothing that many who heard her speak fell asleep instantly, including Janus and Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d John asked, struggling to keep himself from falling asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve given me hope for the future of my children, now I give it to you and others like you,\u201d the figure said. \u201cI once thought that I had failed in my duty as a parent, after all, I had created animals for my children that needed to eat meat to eat, but they went after their weaker brothers and sisters. I left them, saddened that I had created such monstrosities. However you gave me hope, for I\u2019ve been watching you for a long time. You have in you the urge to feast upon your weaker brethren, like that child in your hands.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John looked down at Julia and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only met her just yesterday, when I saved her, but I\u2019ve fallen for her. I want to take care of her,\u201d he said, stifling yet another yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\" the figure said. \"You also know that you could end up causing her problems, especially with your urge to feed on human flesh.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I know. Will I, and others like me, ever get over that urge?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do not know, my child. In time your descendants might get over it, but I do not know about those currently living. However, people like you, people who have the urge but fight it, can help teach young ones, so they will never have the urge. Now go to sleep. When you wake up, you and everyone else won\u2019t remember seeing me. People will just think you gave a passionate speech in that every sentient being is equal and should be treated the way one wants to be treated themselves. They will want to change themselves, and their policies, so that all people are treated as equals.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John\u2019s eyes threatened to close themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before they did, he asked, \u201cWait, before you go, can you tell me, who you are?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the woman of light smiled and said, \u201cI have many names, giver and taker of life, goddess of fertility, the one all mighty, Allah, Yahweh, Jehovah, and many more, including God. However, my favorite name has always been Gaia.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John\u2019s eyes finally closed. The woman smiled, kissed him on the cheeks, and disappeared, full of hope that her offspring had learned from their ancestors\u2019 mistakes and misfortunes.</span></div></div>",

At the moment though, John\u2019s head feels like a giant had stepped on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemind me to never go out drinking again,\u201d he said, as he picked Julia up and carried her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw everyone else doing the same, helping others up, not caring too much who or what they were, and heading home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got home, John took a shower and put on a set of clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it wasn\u2019t necessary for him, or other non humans, to wear cloths, he had been raised that wearing clothing was something that one should do everyday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at Julia, who he had laid down on the couch, and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe loved the little girl, even if she was just a human. True there may be problems in the future, like boyfriends and the like, but for now, he wanted to remember this moment, just as it was, perfect.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If he got fired, there would be no one to protect the human students from the other teachers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven John\u2019s reputation, most teachers tended not to \u201cfail\u201d students that took his class, which was all of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he had no power in the school system, his physical abilities, and the stories about him, prevented many teachers from doing much harm to the students that took his class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, after he learned why one of his students was not currently in his room, he had gone after that student\u2019s previous class\u2019s teacher and beat him to the point that the teacher vomited that student up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school though, that teacher had come after him, while John was still in his \u201chuman\u201d form.  John though, managed to paralyze that person from the waist down, with a simple kick to his spinal column. The reason he hadn\u2019t killed him was to show his students an important lesson, anyone can kill someone in anger, but that it took something special to stay calm and only do just enough damage to keep one\u2019s self alive, but not kill their attacker. Of course, the school had had to hirer a new gym teacher after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, he also made sure that students didn\u2019t prey upon other students, at the very least. He had once caught a couple of students doing just that. He had tied them up and hung them in a very painful, and awkward, position from the flagpole. He had made sure that everyone in the school could see them, as the flagpole was visible from most classes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, every student, not to mention teacher, feared him after those incidents. About the only reason students took his class was so that they could get his protection from other teachers. Also, among the teachers, Janus was the only one who didn\u2019t fear him, as Mr. Snapjaw didn\u2019t want to do anything to upset him after his own personal experiences with John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanus would sit down with him and talk to him during lunch, which was usually the most dangerous time for human students in the school. However, with John there, no student dared to do anything to another while he was around.</span></div></div>",

He doubted that even his own parents would have recognized their son, though they might have known somehow, in their hearts that he was their son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he chuckled, causing Julia to wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny Mr. John?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at her and said, \u201cNothing really, but yesterday sure was crazy\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\" Julia said. \"Hey, did you see that lady?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat lady?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat lady made out of light,\u201d Julia said. \"Don't you remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John looked at Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember seeing a bright light,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I defiantly didn\u2019t see any lady made of light.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it was just a dream then,\u201d said Julia, as she placed her head on John\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not,\u201d John said. \u201cI did feel some sort of presence, as if my mother was watching me, as I did that speech. Maybe someone like that was indeed watching over us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, whoever she was,\" Julia said. \"I felt safe with you nearby.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here as well with me little one,\" John said, as he gave the girl a hug and kiss. \"The same for me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then smiled, until he felt his stomach rumble, and heard Julia\u2019s as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I best get breakfast ready,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel hungry enough to eat a giant, not that I would, even if I was capable of the deed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what is for breakfast then?\u201d Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is eggs, bacon, pancakes and milk and juice, all of it guilt free,\u201d John said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what would you do if something like the other night happens?\u201d Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John looked at her and said, \u201cI would sooner kill myself than to harm you. However, I do know someone who could help us out with that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d Julia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA friend I made when I was going for my teaching degree,\" John said. \"Guy\u2019s a very powerful wizard, and he knows several protection spells. One of these spells was placed upon the doorway to his room. It could keep someone who meant to harm him out, very useful considering that the guy made a lot of ex-girlfriends angry, and had made several girls\u2019 boyfriends very jealous. Heck, the guy once used a barrier that let young ladies to go into the locker room, but not out, until they stripped naked in front of, and got kissed by, him, as well as a few other things, which I don\u2019t want to tell you about. Needless to say, a young \u2018female\u2019 shape-shifter convinced him to take it down, after she got him good, by looking like his mother. Trust me when I say I still get a chuckle out of that, because I had told her to do that, thankfully, I don\u2019t think he knows my role in that. However, that one spell of his should keep you safe from harm, as long as you are in that room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the pair had breakfast, John made a phone call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he hung up, John heard a poof and said, \u201cYou\u2019re late Jimmy, by a quarter of a second.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlame my wife for that,\u201d said a deep voice.  \u201cShe had to give me a kiss before I left.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked behind him and saw a man wearing a business suit. However, the suit seemed to be alive, and very feminine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe looks good on you,\u201d John said, as he kissed the suit\u2019s cuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suit turned a bright shade of red, as if blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy thank you John,\u201d said a female voice, which came from the suit\u2019s collar. \u201cYou were right when you said he was a handful.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, something tells me he doesn\u2019t dare cheat on you, especially if he\u2019s wearing you,\u201d John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course not,\" the suit said. \"Considering what I can do to him, like absorbing him into my body, or making him look like a very beautiful, and attractive, as well  as delicious, woman.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I know all about that Clara,\" John said, with a chuckle. \"Which was why we had that little chat before you went to see him while we were at the university.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey how often does a shape-shifter like me find someone who likes me, no matter what form I take?\u201d Clara asked, with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust as long as you don\u2019t look like my mother when we are in bed again,\u201d Jimmy muttered under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Clara said, \u201cI heard that, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jimmy, who was called James by most, though his friends always called him Jimmy, looked at John and said, \u201cSo where is this girl you want me to cast the spell for and where do you want me to place the spell?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, look at the little dear standing behind him, she\u2019s cute,\u201d Clara said, as she forced James to walk around the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate it when she does this,\u201d James said, as he tried to turn his head to keep looking at John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just chuckled and said, \u201cJust be glad it\u2019s her and not her \u2018brother\u2019. That guy was pissed when you did his girlfriend behind his back, as it were. It took some major reasoning to, not only to get him to calm down, but to convince him not to go out and absorb you, and break the rules of the university.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, James rolled his eyes, and, until Clara formed a bit of a hood, so she could control his head, and make him look at Julia, muttered under his breath a few words that no one should hear. However, as he looked at Julia, he gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know this girl?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not directly I assure you,\" James said. \"But there is no mistaking those blue eyes and that red hair. She is my older sister\u2019s daughter, may her soul finally rest in peace. She was kidnapped over ten years ago, and her mother and father were brutally murdered. Heck I couldn\u2019t even turn them into the undead, was how bad it was. While the spirit of my brother-in-law passed on, my sister\u2019s soul has been following me, always telling me to find her child. How did you, of all people, find her?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s just say a student at the school I work at found her, and I took her from him, and have been taking care of her since then,\u201d John said, knowing that it was best to not upset his friend with the whole story, especially about how he had found the girl half-way down someone's throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess,\" James said, looking into his eyes. \"She was sold to a stockyard, where his family bought her for their son\u2019s meal, he took her to school, where he tried to eat her, but you intervened.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty close to it yah,\u201d John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no matter how you got her, thank you!\u201d At this, James wrapped his arms around John, who also felt a bunch of \u201ckisses\u201d on his cheeks from Clara. James blushed when he noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess Clara\u2019s feeling a little affectionate today,\u201d he said, as he saw more than a few wet splotches on John\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it could be worse,\u201d John said as he took a damp cloth and started washing his face. \u201cWhen my mother kissed my father, she\u2019d have to do it before she put any lipstick on, otherwise he\u2019d have to get new clothes and take a bath before he left for work. As it was, they had to be careful; otherwise my father would get stuck on my mother\u2019s lips.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John chuckled, as he remembered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames then kneeled down, with tears in his eyes, and hugged Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea what I went through as I tried to find you,\u201d he said, as he gently stroked her hair, sobbing. \u201cNone of my locator spells could work, I was unable to see what you looked like, the police couldn\u2019t find your kidnappers, and there was no trace of you to be found. I searched everywhere I could even think of, restaurants, stockyards, morgues, slave market, pet stores, and every other place, even the sewers and septic systems.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at John and asked, \u201cHow can I ever repay you for finding my niece?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just smiled and said, \u201cWell, you know how I feel about humans, especially ones who can\u2019t use magic, much like your niece here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\" James said, as he looked at his friend. \"You kept on telling me about what your parents did to help out children unfortunate enough to be sent to stockyards, that they would buy and adopt them as theirs and so forth. You would always say that they deserved to be treated like everybody else, and given the same rights, and that, instead of eating humans, and weaker monsters, that people like you should buy, or hunt, wild animals for meat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, basically,\" John said. \"That is what I would say to you when we were studying about the different races.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as much as I\u2019m sure most of my brethren would want to reject our human heritage, I found out at a young age that I could cast more powerful spells when I was around my family than when I was away from them,\u201d James said, letting his dark black eyes turn a gentle blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if someone held a rally, calling for equal rights for all, would you attend it?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefiantly,\" James said. \"I would attend, and support the cause as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if only because your family is the reason you can weld powerful magic?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\" James said. \"It would be so that no one goes through what I did, as I searched for her. I destroyed several hundred stockyards and restaurants looking for her, and sent those held there to better places.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, that was over a course of a decade, right,\u201d John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\" James said. \"Although I heard a giant white wolf destroyed several dozen in your city yesterday, before it gave a speech that all sentient beings are equal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s very true,\" John said, with a sly smile. \"I was there when it happened.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think it was?\u201d James asked, as he looked at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe spirit of someone who had seen a lot of evil and wants people to change their ways sounds like a very good possibility to me,\u201d John said, as he picked Julia up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d agree with that dear,\u201d Clara said. \u201cThe spirit could have lost someone that it cared about in a violent manner. That does cause spirits to become angry and destructive at times.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but why would it perform a speech that everyone is equal?\u201d James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe some things are just meant to be unexplained, until we find the meaning for ourselves,\u201d John said, as he poured a couple of cups of tea for his guests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then handed them to the pair as they sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let\u2019s talk about Julia,\u201d said John. \u201cWould you two be able to take care of her?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, we\u2019d love to,\u201d Clara said, with a chirp in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, the lifestyle we have would not be suitable for her,\" James said. \"Between our experiments, and the fact we are often not home, we have no real time to care for a child. She would be better off with you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, well about that, that\u2019s why I called you,\" John said. \"You remember that time you found me asleep outside our room?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\" James said. \"For some reason my protective barrier spell decided that you were a threat to me and forced you outside of our room. I\u2019ve never figured out why it did that to you, cause every other time before and after that, it let you into our room.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because, that night, I was a threat to your safety,\u201d John said, with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d James asked, concerned about his former collage roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that there are times that a part of me hungers for the taste of long pig, if you know what I mean,\u201d John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re serious, a vegetarian like you, hungers for the taste?\u201d James asked, with a nervous look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn turned his head away, in shame, and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d he said, as he looked back at James and Clara. \u201cAnd with Julia here, well, I want to make sure she\u2019s safe during those times. I was lucky the other night, I stepped on a loose board I hadn\u2019t gotten around to fixing, and was able to come to my senses before I was able to cause her any harm.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you obviously don\u2019t want any harm to happen to her,\u201d James said, as he looked at his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, you got that right,\" John said, as he lowered his head slightly. \"Then again, I wouldn\u2019t want her spirit haunting me because I couldn\u2019t control myself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in that case,\" James said, finishing his tea. \"Show me the room she sleeps in.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With that, John led James and Clara up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice place you have,\u201d said James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t anything, until you see what I\u2019ve been up to since graduation,\u201d John said, as he opened up a shutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames gasped as he saw the houses, all in various degrees of construction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, I knew you were wealthy, but how many houses do you need?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019m planning on renting them out. I even have a pair of potential renters looking to rent one of the finished homes, but with yesterday\u2019s events, they may or may not come, though I kind of hope that they do show up today.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd who would these people be?\u201d James asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just a nice married giant couple,\u201d John said, with a sly smile, as he watched James's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiants, that\u2019s crazy!?!\" the dark wizard said. \"Don\u2019t you know they could wreak the place and eat everyone that lived here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, but that\u2019s why I have a special contract written up,\" John said. \"Basically, if someone who lives on my land eats someone else who also lives on my land, they will, at the very least, be evicted from my property. Of course, the bean counters over in city hall think it\u2019s so that I, and they, can get more money, me from rent and they from taxes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch like the headmaster at the university, hmm?\u201d James asked, with a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, just like him,\" John sad. \"Now, if those bean counters were smart, they would press for passing a law that would prevent people from eating each other.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy, it would be because of money,\" John said, making a motion with his fingers, the sign for money grubber. \"Your average couple pays for property taxes, school taxes, electricity, water, gas, vehicle payments, gasoline, medical bills, food, and other expenses. Now, imagine what would happen if meat from non-sentient animals was much more widely available and those sorts of laws prohibiting people from eating others were to pass.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that a lot would complain,\" James said, as he looked at his friend. \"It\u2019s very easy for most people to catch a human and eat them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\" John said. \"But what if they heard that they would pay fewer taxes, individually, if they didn\u2019t go after humans as prey?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you want to use their greed for money to convince them not to go out and eat others,\u201d James said, with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh believe me. Everyone likes money, and they can\u2019t get enough of it,\" John said, as he knew a lot about money, considering the fact that he was wealthy. \"Now, if such laws were passed, the national debt would, eventually, be erased. Also, if people had more money, chances are they would spend more money. Then, over time, even if the tax laws change, the different races will consider each other people, and will call eating others what it really is, murder.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, James looked at John and nodded. \u201cI agree with you,\u201d he said. \u201cI went through a lot as I tried to find my niece. In fact, I had almost given up hope many times, but the look on my sister\u2019s face just kept me from giving up the search.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you can tell her the good news,\" John said, as he put a hand on his friend. \"Then, before she passes on, she can come and visit her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, well just one thing,\" James said, as his eyes started to grow dark again. \"Does she know the people who held her captive?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she told me her last name was Sanders,\" John said, speaking very carefully, as it was not wise to be the target of a dark wizard's wrath. \"Of course, that could be an alias that her captors went by, or maybe she was left to die and a poor couple took her in and tried to raise her, until she became spoiled, as it were.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, either way,\" James said, as he turned to walk along the hallway. \"I\u2019m going to track them down after I perform this spell for you. If they found her on the streets or something, I thank them for taking care of her, but curse them for selling her to the stockyard. If they killed my sister and brother-in-law, and kidnapped her, then sold her to the stockyard, either I will have some new test subjects or Clara will have herself a rare meal, as she doesn\u2019t eat human flesh too often.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John gave a weak smile and a nervous chuckle. It wasn\u2019t wise to mess with a wizard, or something, or someone, which he or she cared about. If a giant\u2019s temper was something to avoid at all costs, a wizard\u2019s wrath was something that even giants feared, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John showed James the room that Julia had slept in the other night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad,\u201d James said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks perfect for a young girl. Did you do this yesterday?\u201d Clara asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d John said. \u201cI have several dozen nieces and nephews you should know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I kind of figured that your older stepbrothers and sisters would have had children.\u201d James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA good deal of them happens to a few years older than I am,\" John said. \"In fact, I would not have been surprised if my older brothers and sisters helped my parents take care of the younger ones while I was at the university. Also, I think a few of them adopted the younger ones when mother and father died.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, you still care about them,\u201d James said, as he looked at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course I do,\" John said. \"They are my family, every last one of them. I don\u2019t care what those fools that call themselves my blood relatives say, the children that my parents adopted are more my family than those others are. Then again, they treated my parents like dirt, just because they were half human and didn\u2019t eat humans very often. In fact, I doubt that they would even want to deal with me, especially after my youngest cousin\u2019s wedding; I destroyed that after I saw them trying to serve a good friend of mine from school as the main course. Needless to say, we haven\u2019t spoken to each other on good terms since then, and that was a month before I went to the university.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you haven\u2019t spoken with them for the last ten years,\u201d said Clara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, the last time I met up with my parents\u2019 relatives was five years ago, shortly after my parents died,\" the size-shifting werewolf said, with a sigh. \"They were upset that I got everything and they got nothing. That was because of the way my parents worded their wills. Their wills said that their children would receive everything. Well, my parents\u2019 relatives said that my older, and younger, brothers and sisters were not my parents\u2019 children, and they would of gotten everything except for one small problem, me. Since I never used my shape-shifting or size changing abilities around them, they thought that I was just an exceptionally strong human, and that one wedding was for a cousin on my father\u2019s side so I didn\u2019t have to do any shifting or changing to beat him, so I could save my friend. When they tried to claim that I wasn\u2019t my parents\u2019 biological son, I requested that a paternal test be done, to show my heritage. Well, the test came back positive; I was my parents\u2019 biological child. However, my one cousin, a giant, challenged me, for the right of inheritance. He claimed that, as a giant, he was superior to me, a \u2018human\u2019.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Clara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I tried to get him to change his mind, and not to challenge the will,\" John said, as he remembered that day. \"Also, during the fight, I kept telling him that he had no idea what he was up against. Eventually, I kicked him in the knees, causing him to drop. It was then, and only then, that I shifted into my giant werewolf form, and showed him just how outclassed he really was compared to me. He thought that he was going to die when I grabbed him by his throat and lifted him off of the ground. However, I just dropped him in his chair and asked if anyone else wanted to challenge my parents\u2019 will. None did and I got everything, though I did split some of the money with my siblings. After all, they deserved it, because they had been given that second chance by my parents, so long ago.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour parents did a lot to help normal humans out,\u201d said James, with a low chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, well, I guess I best leave you two to casting that spell,\u201d John said. \u201cI know you prefer to do this sort of magic without others watching.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John went downstairs, to be with Julia.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even without his magic, he is very powerful. Also, he is quite intelligent, always got the top grades in class. However, he was also quite the slacker, spending more time in the rooms of various girls instead of studying. However, thanks to Clara, he has straightened considerable.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s my aunt like?\u201d Julia asked, curious about the family she had, but never knew existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s the gentlest soul I know,\" John said, with a smile. \"It isn\u2019t very often she\u2019d want to eat a human, you\u2019d have to really get her angry for her to even think about eating you. As for her different forms, name something and she can turn into it, from animals, to the different races, to furniture, to clothing. About the only thing that I have problems with is the fact that she, like most shape-shifters, has a rather large sexual apatite.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that John?\u201d Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ll tell you more about, in about five years,\" John said, as he felt that Julia didn't need to know about that stuff yet. \"Suffice to say, when a shape-shifter finds someone they really, really like, you will rarely find them separated from that person. Of course, your aunt is something special. As I said, she is a very gentle soul. In fact, she was a very good friend of mine at the university.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, James came down the stairs. \u201cThe spell\u2019s all set up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone that tries to enter that room to try and harm Julia, including you John, when you lose control of yourself, will be unable to enter it. And, John, if you are already in the room, and do lose control, you will just be teleported outside of the room.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks James, that\u2019s at least one worry off of my chest,\u201d said John, as he placed his hand on James\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you just take care of my niece,\u201d James said. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve got to see some people about their treatment of a child I\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, James vanished in a flash of dark, black, smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuy always was a bit of a show off,\u201d John said, coughing a bit, as tried to fan the air, so he and Julia could see. \u201cHowever, behind the smoke and mirrors, he is both very skilled, and very powerful, with his magic.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I should know about that, that friend of mine angered one, and the only thing that saved his life was the barrier he had place on the room.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John smiled and chuckled. James had slept with more women then he could remember the names for. As a result, the guy had a long list of enemies that wanted to kill him, for one reason or another. However, with Clara to satisfy James\u2019s personal fetish about knowing the figures of the female versions of the different races, he hadn\u2019t been sleeping with too many other women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you Monday Janus,\u201d John said, after they had talked for a little while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just take care of yourself John,\u201d Janus said, as she took flight and flew off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then looked at his students and asked, \u201cNow, what was it that I assigned to you two?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo figure out if one race is superior to another,\u201d replied Tawna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d said John. \u201cNow tell me, Justian, Is your race superior to Tawna\u2019s race, or Julia\u2019s even?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about Tawna\u2019s, but I think my kind might be superior to Julia\u2019s,\u201d said Justian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mean physically, mentally, spiritually, or socially?\u201d John asked, in a quizing manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, they are superior, physically?\u201d Justian replied, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me the physical advantages that one of your species has over a human.\u201d John said, looking at the rakasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my kind is stronger, faster, more agile, and if it got cold, we have fur to keep us warm.\u201d Justian said, confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have given some good points,\" John said, as he smiled at his student. \"However, if a cat-person, of any sort, and a human, of equal height, leg lengths, and speed were to run an endurance race, say twenty miles in length, the human would eventually win.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\" Justian asked. \"I have outrun every human I\u2019ve come across in running competitions.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\" John said. \"But those races are usually no more than a quarter of a mile at the most, so you could beat them. If you honestly ran against one, were the distance was twenty miles, and you were not allowed to eat the competition, at around the five, or ten, mile mark, you would have to stop, so you could catch your breath and cool down. That human though, if he\u2019s smart, will just snag a water bottle, and keep on running, tossing the bottle in the trash when he is done. That is because you will stop, so you can pant, so you can cool down. A human though can keep on running because he will sweat, thus cooling himself off, all while on the run. That means, that human will hit the twenty mile mark long before you do, and will win.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Justian\u2019s mouth dropped. He had never thought that a human could even have a chance at beating him in anything, let alone his favorite pastime, running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShocking, isn\u2019t it,\u201d John said, with a chuckle. \u201cI also know it to be a very real possibility that humans can outrun other beings. After all, a human who can outrun a hungry predator is one that survives, usually. Also, while I was at the university, I saw a werewolf and a human have a distance race; the loser had to be the winner\u2019s servant for the month. The two had had a beef over who was the better runner, so it was decided, by the track coach, that the pair would have a race to see who the better runner was. Well, I decided to watch it, as did most everyone on campus. At first, the werewolf was in the lead, but, at the ten mile mark, he had to stop, because he was overheating. That human though, at the ten mile mark, he took a bottle of water, drank it, tossed it in the trash, and continued on his way. When he reached the fifteen mile mark, the werewolf had cooled down enough to reenter the race. However, by the time he reached the seventeen mile point, the human crossed the twenty mile mark. Needless to say, the coach was impressed, by both of them. The werewolf had broken a national record for the ten mile mark, and the human had set a new record for the twenty mile run. Over all though, the couch was divided over who the better runner was. The werewolf was faster than the human, but the human could run farther than the werewolf. As a result, the contest was considered a tie. Funny thing was, after the race, the pair became very good friends, or at least respected the other enough to help the other out on occasion.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John smiled and shook his head, as he gave a light chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can tell,\u201d he said. \u201cThat university helped reinforce the things that my parents had taught me as a child. It was there I learned that everyone is equal. It was also there that I learned that no race has any real advantage or disadvantage over any other. All sentient beings feel the same things, love, hate, joy, sadness, anger, regret, despair, hope, and so forth. The moment you strip away the physical differences, and look at a person\u2019s soul, you will see that people of two radically different races have a lot more in common with each other than they do not.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Tawna and Justian looked at each other and Julia, as John walked into his office. The speech John had just given them was the reverse of everything they had been taught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been raised to believe that there were those whose races were superior to others and all non-humans were superior to humans, except for those with magic, who weren\u2019t really considered humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they had been told by their philosophy teacher that everyone was the same as everyone else, on the inside anyways. He had basically said that a weak, and short, human was equal to the tallest giant, along with everyone else in between.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something\u2019s wrong with Tawna and Justian! They seem to be sick like you were the other night!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then heard a low chuckle. \u201cI expected something like that would occur,\u201d John said, as he opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Julia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey realize the painful, and horrible, truth,\u201d John said, as he got a couple of buckets and damp washcloths. \u201cThey now realize that every person that they had ever eaten, or somehow harmed, was just like them. That they were people like them, people who had had their futures ahead of them, and more. They are feeling the guilt of taking those people\u2019s lives for satisfying their own desires. Of course, I had not expected them to experience the sickness this soon, maybe later in the week, like say Wednesday, but not after only, basically, a few hours with you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John went to take care of his ailing students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Tawna groaned, as she opened her eyes, after the strange illness had passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, looking at John, who was sitting on a stool between her and Justian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I have been calling Realization,\u201d he said, as he took a warm washcloth from Tawna\u2019s head and replaced it with a cool one. \u201cBasically, it happens when one learns the real truth about something, something very important. The mind goes to war with itself, causing the rest of the body to temporarily weaken. While it is not life threatening, it is life changing. Now, here is a very important question: What truth did you and Justian just learn? Also, how will this affect you for the rest of your life?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Tawna said, looking away from John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d John asked, cocking an eyebrow. \u201cMaybe I should bring Julia in; she is worried about you and Justian.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please, don\u2019t let her see me like this,\u201d Tawna said, breathing heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? Why don\u2019t you want her to see you? It\u2019s not like she can get sick from what\u2019s affecting you.\u201d John said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Tawna said, with fear and terror in her voice, \u201cI can see them. I can see every human I have ever eaten. I can see their looks of fear and terror as I swallow them whole and alive. I can hear them screaming in pain as they die, begging for me to let them go. I can feel them struggling, trying to get out of me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Tawna began to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that what you went through the other night, Mr. Wolfstone?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, as I said, I\u2019ve never seen humans as prey. I don\u2019t see, hear, or feel those that I\u2019ve eaten for defensive purposes. However, I do feel the guilt, especially for the one I ate part of, as part of an actual meal,\u201d John said, as he place a hand on Tawna\u2019s cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, the sooner you realize, and accept, the truth, the better you should feel,\u201d John said, as he turned to check on Justian, who was himself just stirring from his illness induced catnap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, after John has had his talk with Justian, Justian and Tawna were sitting on opposite ends of the couch, looking away from each other. The ghosts of their pasts seemed to haunt them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did we try eating those two guys?\u201d Justian asked; with a slight growl in his voice. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t tried to, you and I would not be feeling this pain right now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Justian,\u201d said Tawna. \u201cBut I know I\u2019m not afraid of Mr. Wolfstone anymore. Before this, I thought that if I got into trouble, he would beat me half to death.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be beaten to death than feel this pain.\u201d Justian said, with anger in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, but maybe, this is his way of showing people the truth behind all of those speeches he tells in class,\" Tawna said. \"Maybe, this is how he learned things about the world, because of the pain he felt. It almost feels like I can understand how he thinks about things, like how similar different people really are.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah well keep that to your own self,\" Justian said, not even turning his head to look at her. \"I can\u2019t even look at that human without seeing the faces of those who were my prey, and very tasty meals. It\u2019s not right. A predator shouldn\u2019t feel pity for its prey.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh,\" Tawna groaned, as she thought about how stuborn boys could be. \"I\u2019m going to talk to John. He may know something for this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Tawna got up and went to John\u2019s office, leaving Justian to sulk on the couch. A little while later, Justian heard the springs in the couch creaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid John give you some painkillers?\u201d he asked, turning his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the person that had sat down next to him was John himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just looked at him and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk, just you and me. Julia\u2019s asleep in her room and Tawna is currently working on some of her other homework. Besides, some fresh air will do you a world of good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, John and Justian were walking through a field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is something about walking that helps me to relax after a hard day,\u201d John said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the sun, the birds chirping, or the brook babbling over there, but it helps me to calm down after a stressful day. What helps calm you down?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you had asked me this morning, I would have said eating live humans,\" Justian said, as he followed his teacher. \"But now, I don\u2019t know what to think.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. It\u2019s not easy having your entire world turned upside-down,\" John said, as he looked at his student, with a sympathetic face. \"I remember when I first tasted human flesh; I thought it was the most delicious thing I had ever eaten. However, when I learned that it was the same thing that my brothers and sisters were, I felt like I had killed that person. After that, I practically vowed to do everything I could do to help those weaker than I was. I became the problematic student that teachers would focus their attention on, so that they wouldn\u2019t go after those with poorer grades or were tardy more than three times. I would hit teachers who tried to \u2018discipline\u2019 the other students. After the third time, I was warned that I would be expelled if I hit a fourth teacher, so I figured a way around it, if I claimed the student as my \u2018pet\u2019, the teacher couldn\u2019t touch them. So, when I knew that the teacher was gunning for someone, I would pull that classmate to the side and talk to him or her and warn them, at the very least. I would also ask that they start hanging around me and doing things for me. Then, when the teacher tried to have them \u2018failed\u2019 I would immediately stake my claim on my classmate. Needless to say, my parents were shocked when I brought home my first \u2018pet\u2019. When I told them my reasons, they figured I was just doing a lesser form of what they had been doing for years, giving deserving children a second chance for life. Of course, after that, I had to clear it with my parents first, and I would first get the kid used to hanging around my family, so that things wouldn\u2019t be that much different for them, when I had to make my claim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Justin sighed and asked \u201cHow does one get used to this pain, the one I am feeling right now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at John, who looked back at him, sighed, and said, \u201cThe short answer kid is this, you can\u2019t. The pain will be with you for the rest of your life, no matter how deep you try to hide it, it will be there. However, there are ways to deal with it. The first step is to admit that you are in pain, which you have. Next, you must admit, to your self at least, the things that caused the pain, especially if it was your own actions that caused it. Then you talk to others about it, preferable those who have gone through the same, or a similar, pain as you. You follow those simple steps, and you won\u2019t feel the pain so much, but you will still have it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon John stopped at the top of a hill and sat down on a stump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit down Justian,\u201d he said. \u201cEnjoy the view.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat down, Justian saw a look in John\u2019s eyes that he hadn\u2019t seen very often, a look of content. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t often I\u2019m truly happy,\u201d John said. \u201cMost of the time I have to put on a bit of an act, acting like some cold heartless son of a bastard, who would sooner kill you than give you the time of day. However, that just isn\u2019t me. In fact, I hate to act that way, I want to just be myself around you and the other students. I don\u2019t like it when people look at me in fear for their lives. Unfortunately, many people out there are people that only think and believe one thing and that is that weaker people are meant to be either their slaves, or pets, or their meals. As for me, the only way I\u2019d eat a human, who wasn\u2019t trying to kill one of my friends, was if I was dying from starvation, and only if there was absolutely no other foods. In fact, if I had to choose between eating the flesh of a human, and a worm ridden apple, I\u2019d rather eat the worm ridden apple. I would eat a piece of cow steak that resembled burnt leather, rather than the finest, most juicy, most tender, filet of human breast. That is because, to me, a sentient being is a person, and, for me, should only be eaten if there is absolutely no other choice. However, if you want to go out and eat a human, I won\u2019t try to stop you. But, remember this, what if it was the other way around, what if you were the human and that human was you, would you want to be that person\u2019s meal, or would you want to live?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John turned his head, so he could watch butterflies gathering nectar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustian began to do some thinking. While John hadn\u2019t told him he shouldn\u2019t eat humans, he had been told to think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was also afraid. Every monster, starting around the age of five, learned how to hunt and eat humans. He was currently fifteen, and in the ninth grade. Even if he had only eaten one human a month, that was, at least, one hundred twenty people he had killed over the course of his lifetime, and many others ate more than that, per month even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Justian felt like puking again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like my words have finally, and fully, sunk into you Justian,\u201d John said, turning his head back to look at him. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid because of what you have done. You are worried about it, and how it will affect you. Well let me say this, the sooner you tell someone what you have done, the better you will feel.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Justian started talking, telling John about every single human he had ever eaten, the person\u2019s age, how he had eaten them, where, why, everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Justian was done, he grabbed onto John and started crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI killed them,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn placed his arms around him and said, \u201cI know. But it is not your fault.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is,\" Justian said, still sobbing. \"I can\u2019t deny the fact that I ate all those people.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know young one,\" John said, as he held onto the boy. \"I know. But the fault doesn\u2019t truly lay with just you, it lies with society. If you had grown up in a world where everyone treated each other, large or small, human, werewolf, or otherwise, the same way, and no one was on anyone\u2019s meal menus, you and I would not have this pain we are feeling right now. Instead, we would probably be talking about your grades, any fights you\u2019ve been having, and so on. However, now that you know this pain, you can use it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I do that?\u201d Justian asked, looking up at John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy making sure others will never have a chance to experience it,\" John said, as he gave the boy a gentle smile. \"At first, you start small, with the young ones. Like say, you have a cousin, that is at that age, were he or she could start eating humans. Your aunt brings the child over, for you to babysit, and brings a human of similar age for your cousin to eat for lunch. However, instead of letting your cousin eat the human, you have them play some sort of game together, and when lunchtime comes around, feed your cousin some other type of meat, like beef for instance, and have the human eat something as well. When your aunt shows up, and asks why your cousin didn\u2019t eat the human, you honestly tell her that they just got to playing with each other so much that your cousin just couldn\u2019t eat the human, so you feed him something else. Also, if your parents wonder why you aren\u2019t eating humans, or rescue those who are your classmates, or something, tell them it\u2019s one of the rules for those taking my class. If they have a problem with that, they can take it up with me. Of course, given my school reputation, and the fact that I\u2019ve won every fight I\u2019ve ever been in, they may just swallow their pride and go along with it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they, or the school for that matter, want to challenge you then?\" Justian asked. \"They could do it through law you know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey could,\" John said. \"But it would be an expensive legal battle for any one to sue me in a civil case. Even if they somehow managed to win, they would be so far into debt; they might as well have lost. A pyritic victory is what that would be. They would have won the battle, only to lose the war. After that, I\u2019d end up owning them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John chuckled, and smiled broadly. \u201cCan you even imagine how I would even run an entire school?\" he asked. \"I have one being built on my property and I still don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll run the entire thing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re seriously building a school and you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll do with it.\u201d Justian said, his eyes wide with amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John slapped his knee and started laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got that right,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to put a touch on my parents\u2019 dream, and have a spot for the children of those that rent out my houses to learn, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to go so far to get to school, and it would be a safe one for them to go to as well, no matter their species. Admittedly, it would be difficult for those of the water to attend it, but that is true for most schools built on the land. Of course, if a family was interested in renting out a space here, I would have accommodations built for them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he said, \u201cWell, we best get back to the house. I am expecting some potential clients to show up after all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John and Justian stood up and started walking back, John with a smile on his face and Justian feeling as if a weight was lifted off of his shoulders, though he still felt some pain in his soul.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As it turned out, John did have some company waiting for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant couple from the other day was sitting at the one table that John had outside. John just shook his head and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKid, you best get Tawna and wake Julia up, though you best be a little bit careful with her, find a window and watch,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to be interesting.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Justian then went inside as John walked to the table. When John got to the table, he grew to the same size as the giants and sat down on the side opposite of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you read the forms?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe did,\u201d the man said. \u201cAnd while I personally don\u2019t like some of the rules you have written down on them, I think I understand them. After all, as a stockbroker I\u2019d want to make sure I got the maximum return on something I have invested in. You don\u2019t want to have to find someone else to replace someone that we ate, who was renting out one of your homes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell, that would part of it,\" John said. \"However, my late parents wanted something bigger and better than me just being a landlord, way bigger. Their dream was so big, not even the world could compare to it in size and scope.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what was it?\u201d the woman asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John just smiled and said, \u201cFor people to see the real truth and realize what they have done, not only to themselves, but to others as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d the man asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just looked at him and said, \u201cLet\u2019s just say it is a really painful experience for a young one to go through. An older person though, well, he, or she, may kill him/herself before it is over.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d the woman asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I could handle anything thrown at me,\u201d the man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe experience is not a physical one,\u201d said John. \u201cNo, it is one of the mind, and of the spirit. The person must admit the truth about their selves, or risk becoming suicidal, and even then, the person\u2019s pain will last for the rest of their lives.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John sighed, heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI experienced it when I was seven,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with the pain since then, though there are times it increases in strength, after I have to do something I hate. It is a pain I wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone, but people must experience it, so that others in the future will never have a reason to even feel a portion of it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what is it that we\u2019d have to experience to even feel this pain, so we can avoid it?\u201d the man asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at him and said, \u201cSee through the eyes of a human and you will find out. Once you do that, there is no going back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the couple placed their final signatures on the forms and started making the arrangement to have their stuff moved into their new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were done making the arrangements, the woman asked, \u201cCould you tell me about that human girl you have?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want to know about her?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, where did you get her?\" the woman asked. \"She doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s your daughter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, a really long story really short,\" John said. \"Is this, she\u2019s my best friend\u2019s niece, his sister and brother-in-law were murdered, and he can\u2019t take care of her so he asked me to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds a little weird to be true,\u201d the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I know,\" John said, with a chuckle. \"But the long version, that is even stranger.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust how strange is it?\u201d the female giant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say it makes a couple of half humans, one part giant, the other part werewolf, getting together, adopting hundreds of children, finally having one of their own after forty years of trying, and that child being able to turn into a werewolf, a giant, and a giant werewolf seem normal in comparison,\" John said, with another chuckle. \"And that in itself sounds too strange to be true but it is.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, who is this friend of yours?\u201d the woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is one very powerful wizard,\" John said. \"He\u2019s also the last guy I\u2019d ever want to anger. In fact, I expect him to show up any second to tell me about his search for his sister\u2019s killers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a cloud of pitch black smoke appeared on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone called for me,\u201d said a deep voice, followed by a cough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, you put too much black powder in that smokescreen, more than you normally do,\u201d said a coughing female voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d have to agree with Clara on that one,\u201d said John, who took a slow breath to blow the smoke away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the sight John saw shocked him. James\u2019s face had more than a few fresh scars, and Clara seemed to be all over his entire body, carefully controlling his movements. It was as if he was in a full body, but mobile, cast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJames,\u201d John exclaimed, \u201cWhat in the hell happened to you?!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, James just chuckled as best as he could, and said, \u201cNothing that a month of Clara\u2019s tender loving care won\u2019t fix. For a bunch of non-magical humans, those two murderers were full of deadly tricks, and treachery. I guess if it weren\u2019t for Clara\u2019s ability to mimic anything, and if I didn\u2019t have magic, I\u2019d be dead. But as it is, I\u2019ve got two test subjects to perform experiments on. Now I won\u2019t have to pay someone to test out my potions, and other such things. Well, while it is good to see you again John, but I best be off. You know how uncomfortable I get around giants, even those who are my friends.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, James and Clara disappeared, in an even bigger cloud of smoke than they had arrived in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWay too much smoke James,\u201d John said, with a chuckle. \u201cGuy\u2019s got a habit of showing off, especially when there is a woman watching him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long has he been like that?\u201d the giantess asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s been like that ever since I met him ten years ago, at the very least,\" John said. \"Trust me when I say his exploits on campus are legendary, most likely even now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? What did he do?\u201d the woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let me just say this,\" John said, with a smile, as he remembered the first time he saw the wizard. \"The first time I encountered him, an angry male giant was trying to destroy the room I was assigned to use. The reason was because my roommate had \u2018stolen\u2019 his girlfriend. However, no matter how hard he tried, the guy couldn\u2019t do a thing to damage the place. When he told me why he was trying to destroy the room, I offered to give him a hand, walked in, and tossed my roommate out into the hallway. Of course, I did that, on the condition that the giant wouldn\u2019t kill or eat the guy. Needless to say, my roommate practically shit his pants, when he saw that guy grinning down at him, and picked him up, and then dropped him into the room. It was the funniest thing I\u2019d ever seen. Unfortunately, it seemed like I had to deal with something like that every week. Then the guy had the audacity to put a barrier on the girls\u2019 locker room, preventing the girls from leaving until they stripped in front of him, and got kissed by, and had sex with, him. I mean, this barrier was so good, not even the teachers who knew magic could break it down, and no man could enter, or even any female teachers. Of course, as his roommate, I had seen a picture of his mother and I knew a \u2018female\u2019 shape-shifter, so I had a chat with her and she took the form of his mother and went into the locker room. Well, the guy broke a few records, one for the fifty yard dash, one for taking down a barrier spell, and all while in his birthday suit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the woman started laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious? The guy was naked?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe whole time,\u201d said John, with a smile, and chuckled himself. \u201cAfter all, wouldn\u2019t you run if someone, who looked an awful lot like your father, wanted to have sex with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell, yah, but I wouldn\u2019t do it naked,\u201d the wouman said, as she started to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the two just broke out in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John said, \u201cWell, I best let you and your husband finish moving your belongings here. If you, or your husband, have any questions, come and see me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\" the woman said, as she was calming her laughter down. \"My husband and I do kind of have a question about what we are to eat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well if you want to know the things that you are allowed to eat, here are some pictures of the kinds of creatures you can hunt down,\" John said, as he handed the woman some pictures of the various wild amimals. \"As for their size, I know a few spells that can make things larger or smaller, not that I\u2019ve had much of a reason to use them, considering I can change my size on my own.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, tell me,\" the woman said. \"What is it like to change size? I mean, it has to be dangerous to be human size.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, to me, being human is not dangerous,\" John said. \"I once beat a giant cousin of mine while I was human sized. Of course, I am naturally quite strong, no matter what form I\u2019m in. As for size changing, well, I find it useful to scare people off. After all, weren\u2019t you and your husband nervous when you saw me change sizes the other day?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\" the woman said. \"But you had also turned into a giant werewolf as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but your husband needed to realize just who he was dealing with,\" John said. \"Now, if he had spoken to me as if I was an equal in the first place, I would not have bothered to transform. To be honest, I prefer to either be human, or a giant or a werewolf. My giant-werewolf form is just out of place with society, though it is one very effective way to scare the living daylights out of someone, like a misbehaving student.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I best be off Mr. Wolfstone,\" the giantess woman said. \"See you later.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When John entered his house, he felt someone grab him. It was Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I an orphan?\u201d she asked, with a sad puppy dog look in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at her and said, \u201cNo Julia, you are not. You have an uncle who loves you so much; he spent years searching for you. Your aunt Clara finds you adorable. Also, you have me. Besides, as long as you have someone who cares for you, you\u2019ll never be an orphan.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then picked the girl up and hugged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, John saw a flash of white light and saw a pale translucent older version of Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease mister,\u201d the woman said. \u201cCan you let me see my daughter? It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen her. I have so much to say to her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I know you are the girl\u2019s mother and not some trick? For all I know, you could be some fiend that likes to mess with young girls\u2019 minds, and make them suffer horrid things, before you kill them.\u201d John said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMister, I\u2019ve been searching for my daughter for ten long painful years. I have seen things that no mother should ever see. Please mister, I\u2019m begging you, let me see my daughter,\u201d the woman said, with tears in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at the tears, they were no trick or illusion of magic, and a ghost couldn\u2019t cry unless it really was, on the inside, as if its heart was breaking in two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at Julia, who was looking at him with an expression that said, \u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s your mother,\u201d he said. \u201cHer spirit is here and she wants to talk to you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost spirits could not be seen, or heard, unless one had known the person, or knew someone who had known the person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, most spirits that stayed behind were those who felt that they had some sort of unfinished business, whether it was for revenge against the person who had killed them, some sort of guilt that they had felt, like if they thought that they had been an unfit parent and wanted to make up for it, and a wide variety of other strong reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only way for them to cross over was to see that the job was finished, although one could call up and hire a demon to get rid of the restless spirit. Of course, those guys didn\u2019t come cheap, wouldn\u2019t take money, but they would take one\u2019s favorite human as payment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, it was something of a wonder that John didn\u2019t see more ghosts on a daily occurrence. However, he could always sense them, especially around those he felt ate too many people as meals. Then again, he had always felt as if he was haunted after certain events in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had even known that there was, at least, one ghost around James, though he never asked why, because if he knew the person, then he would end up seeing that person\u2019s ghost. However, with the Realization that he had practically forced Tawna and Justian to go through, he knew that they had seen the ghosts following them, if only briefly, before they had passed on, forgiving them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the ghost of Julia\u2019s mother wanted to see, and be seen and heard by, her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then looked at the poor woman and said, \u201cYou can see her. After all I did tell someone close to you that you could.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that would be my little brother Jimmy. You have no idea how long I have waited for this day sir,\u201d said the woman, as John put Julia down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman then touched Julia\u2019s shoulder, so that the girl could see and hear her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia looked at the woman and asked, \u201cAre you really my mother?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pained look in the woman\u2019s eyes when she heard this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s been through a lot,\u201d John said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d the woman said. \u201cShe was only two years old when I and her father were killed. It does stand to reason that she wouldn\u2019t remember or recognize me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the woman looked at Julia and said, \u201cYes child. I am your mother.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman then put her arms around Julia, as if trying to give her a hug, as most ghosts would just pass through the living, or end up possessing them, if only temporarily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is so much that I want to tell you, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have the time to,\u201d the woman said. \u201cSo, instead, can you just give your mother a hug?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia then put her arms around her, being careful not to touch her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was awkward for both of them, so John said, \u201cMiss, how about I let you posses me, that way you and your daughter can feel each others\u2019 touch.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at him and said, \u201cThank you kind sir.\u201d The woman then touched John and took over his body and held her daughter, for a good long while. Then, she was gone, having crossed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs John came back into control, he sensed that the woman trusted him enough to let him take care of her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, looking down at Julia, \u201cThat was different.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you let my mother posses you, so she could give me that hug?\u201d Julia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Julia, I wasn\u2019t there when my parents died, and I didn\u2019t attend their funerals. I couldn\u2019t give them a hug and kiss good-bye. However, with your mother, I could let her have that, at the very least,\u201d said John, as tears fell from his eyes. \u201cShe loved you, you know. Even now I can feel the love she had for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much did she love me?\u201d Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe loved you so much, she gave her life to try and protect you,\" John said, as a tear fell from his eyes. \"She even stuck around, so that she could find you, so she could tell you that she loved you, with all of her heart. She knows that I can, and will, be able to take very good care of you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John picked Julia up, so she could cry on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then saw Tawna and Justian, who had been watching the whole thing. John looked at them and said, in the low voice that Julia couldn\u2019t hear but they could, \u201cGive us some alone time. The girl did just see the ghost of her dead mother. I\u2019m sure you can understand, especially now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two students nodded and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Justian and Tawna got to the living room, they sat down on the couch and looked at each other. What they had seen was very strange, as no self-respecting person would willingly let a ghost posses them, normally, not even humans would do that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a non-human to let a human spirit to posses them was something that was unheard of, far more than non-human spirits that just possessed others to carry out their revenge, or whatever. Once again, they wondered the question of why would their teacher do something that wasn\u2019t normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, John and Julia came into the room, John still holding onto Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at them and said, \u201cIf you are wondering why I let Julia\u2019s mother posses me, so she could give Julia one last hug before she passed on, think about this, if someone you cared about was dying, wouldn\u2019t you want to pay them your last respects?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked at them, with a bit of a sly smile. He knew what he had done was something that was practically unheard of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, he normally would not have let a ghost posses him, but the sight in that woman\u2019s eyes, as she tried to give her daughter a meaningful hug, just made him feel some sadness for her, so he had offered her the use of his body, so she could give Julia a warm, and heart-felt, hug. He could sense that that was a gift that the woman would treasure for all eternity, or at least until it was time for Julia to pass on herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A little while later, John was starting to put a rather large roast in the oven. It was venison, from a deer he had killed and butchered himself, in the way that his father had taught him to. He was cooking it using a recipe that his mother had taught him before he had gone to the university. Also, in addition to his teaching and philosophy courses, John had taken some cooking classes; though no one was allowed to be part of any of the dishes, much with some minor disappointment of the non-humans that wanted to make professional dishes that had humans served in them. Because of that, John knew how to cook foods that would make most chefs jealous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then set the temperature and timer for the roast, and getting to have the other things ready to be cooked as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as he put desert in the fridge to chill, the doorbell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing,\u201d he shouted, as he turned into his werewolf form, as about the only people that tended to show up at that time were traveling salesmen and priests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the people who awaited him at the door were not salesmen or priests. Standing before the doorway was a male naga, a creature that looked like it was half snake and half human, and a female dridder, a creature with the abdomen of a spider and the upper body of a human. With them was a twelve year old male human boy, that happened to be ridding on the dridder\u2019s abdomen, fully clothed, trying to hide from John\u2019s fearsome gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you two want,\u201d John asked, looking at the dridder and naga, who had clothing on their upper bodies. \u201cIf you are here to sell me something, forget it, I am not buying.\u201d He spoke in a deep voice, as if he was annoyed by their intrusion onto his land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair looked at each other, somewhat shocked. Then the naga looked at him and said, in his own deep voice, \u201cWe came here to rent a home. We heard that you had houses for rent.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I do and maybe I don\u2019t,\u201d John said, with his voice still deep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked at the boy, as if noticing him for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice human,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much you want for it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dridder gasped and said, \u201cMy son is not for sale, you monster.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure he\u2019s your son?\" John asked, speaking in a manner that would provoke a certain responce, one of those who truely cared for their children, even those who were not theirs by blood. \"Don\u2019t you mean, pet, or slave, or even, your next meal?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the naga grabbed John by the throat and said, \u201cTalk like that about our son one more time and I will KILL YOU, nice and slow.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John just chuckled, as he grabbed the naga\u2019s wrists, forcing them to release his neck. It was just the sort of responce that he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d he said, carefully massaging his throat. \u201cI had to check your response about me talking like that about him. You\u2019d be surprised about how many people would take up an offer on something like selling their children, even humans. Also, by your responses, I can tell that, at the very least, at least one of you is the boy\u2019s adoptive parent, if not both, and you both love him enough that you would kill to keep him safe. However, while I won\u2019t ask if he is the child of one of you and a human lover, or adopted, I have to ask you this, how do you feel about humans in general?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d the dridder asked, with worry in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is because I have certain requirements that I expect those who rent a house from me to follow,\u201d John said, looking at both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the naga looked at the dridder and said, \u201cThis guy is very strange. From the way he\u2019s been acting, I would say that we shouldn\u2019t trust him, but at the same time, I\u2019m getting a feeling that tells me that we can trust him with our secret.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John smiled and said, \u201cLet me guess, the two of you are \u2018vegetarians\u2019 as it were.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga looked at him and asked, \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just smiled and said, \u201cIt takes one to know one.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the dridder asked. \u201cAre you one as well?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just chuckled and nodded. \u201cI was raised to think of humans, and treat them, as equals. Then again, I had several dozen stepbrothers and sisters who were humans. Also, as much as I hate the fact that a small part of me thinks that human flesh is the most delicious thing I\u2019ve ever eaten, I think of humans as people and not potential meals.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you felt the pain?\u201d the naga asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn lowered his eyes and said, in a low voice, \u201cYah, ever since I was seven, when I had my first actual taste, and ate some human flesh. I thought that it was the most delicious thing I had ever eaten. But, when I found out what it was, I was so overcome with guilt that I threw up in my cousin\u2019s wife\u2019s lap. Even now I can taste it in my mouth, all of those \u2018wondrous flavors\u2019 that cost someone their life to produce. The mere thought of eating a human, or seeing someone else doing it, just sickens me to the pit of my stomach. In fact, the school I work at, as a philosophy teacher, has had to do a lot of changing, because teachers don\u2019t dare to \u2018fail\u2019 any of the students taking my class, and no student dares to have another for \u2018lunch\u2019 because, practically, all of them, including the other teachers, fear my reputation.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d the couple asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, when a young kid kills a teacher, in self defense, and by accident, and has a reputation for being a fighter, you don\u2019t dare force him to do something he doesn\u2019t want to do,\" John said, with a bit of a sigh. \"Also, when one teacher tried to fail one of my students, I forced him to let the kid out, and afterwards I had to kick his ass, and paralyze him below the waist. The school had to get a new gym teacher after that. Also, when I caught some students, who had been sneaking around and eating other students, let\u2019s just say I tied them to the flagpole and leave it at that. I doubt you\u2019d want your son to hear the exact details. About the only sad thing is; I can\u2019t be my real self while on the job.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d the naga said. \u201cIn a way, I was in that sort of position myself, back when I was a police officer in the city we are moving from. I mean, there were certain things I could deal with, even though I hated it, but, as a parent, there are things that I wished I could use my power to shutdown.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess,\" John said, with a knowing look. \"Stockyards that sold children as food?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d the naga said, lowering his eyes. \u201cI mean, what sort of parent would sell their child to become someone\u2019s meal?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean,\" John said, putting a hand on the man's shoulder. \"My parents adopted hundreds of children from such places. Also, I\u2019m taking care of a girl who had been sold to one, though her story is much more complicated than that. Thankfully though, this city\u2019s stockyards were destroyed yesterday, by someone who could be on our side.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah I heard about that,\" the naga said. \"Some sort of giant white wolf wasn\u2019t it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah that was what the creature was,\u201d John said, being careful to not show too much emotion about what he had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s see what forms you have,\" the naga said. \"So that I, and my wife and son, can rent a home here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\" John said. \"Just follow me to my office and we\u2019ll get you started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group walked in, John shifted back into his human form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about my behavior at the door,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout the only people that show up here around this time of day happen to be salesmen trying to sell me something and priests trying to get me to convert to their religion. Now, if I had known that you were only interested in renting a home when I opened the door, I would have just been in my human form.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you a werewolf?\u201d the boy asked, getting off of his mother\u2019s back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at the boy and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you are partway correct on that,\u201d he said. \u201cFather was part werewolf, so I got my werewolf form from him. However, my mother was part giant, and I can easily turn from being a tall \u2018human\u2019 into a decent sized giant. Also, I can also grow to my full height and turn into a werewolf at the same time, making me a giant-werewolf, and I can become any combination in-between. Personally though, I prefer to either be human sized, a werewolf, or a giant. My fully combined form terrifies me at times, especially when I look at my reflection.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he chuckled, as if it was something that was funny, but for him it wasn\u2019t. His giant-werewolf form was more prone to be far more dangerous than his werewolf or giant forms alone. He would only use that form briefly, because he could loose control of himself very easily while in that form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John looked at the naga and dridder and said, \u201cYour son can go into the living room and play with Julia and some students I have over. I know how kids can get board when adults are talking about things they have no interest in or do not understand.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what are these students of yours like?\u201d the dridder asked, with concern in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that they now know the pain that the three of us have, and currently have it now,\u201d John said, as he looked into the living room. \u201cThey broke a rule in my class, shortly before I \u2018confiscated\u2019 Julia from a student who was about to be late to class. They tried to eat a couple of classmates of theirs, so I gave them some very convincing threats, and they let the kids out of their stomachs and I put the two of them under one week of being under my supervision, and they were to follow my rules, including being vegetarians. They also had to take care of Julia when I wasn\u2019t able to. Also, I assigned them with one very important question for them to answer for themselves, about whether or not one race is superior to another. Of course, by now, I think they know the answer, at least partly anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would the answer be?\u201d the naga asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this John just smiled and said, \u201cThat all are equal. Everyone, from the tallest of the tall, to the smallest of the small, has the same feelings, the same sorts of dreams, you know, get through school, go to and get through collage, get a job, have children, and maybe grow old enough to see the first of their great-grandchildren. I know that that was one of my parents\u2019 dreams, which they lived long enough to see. Then again, my oldest stepsiblings are about fifty years older than me, so it is likely that they are great-grandparents themselves. Makes for a somewhat complicated family tree and sending out invitations for family reunions, weddings, and funeral notices a bit of a chore trying to get everyone related to that sibling, so that they can come, but I don\u2019t mind. Besides, those guys are more my family than my blood relatives are anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour biological relatives give you problems?\u201d the dridder asked, in a polite manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to them in five years,\" John said. \"Then again, my mother and father were kind of illegitimate, in that both were born due to a sexual relation between their human parents, who were slaves, or pets, and their non-human masters. To say that my blood, non-human, relatives were very pissed at their wealth and success would be mild in saying. As for my human blood relatives, well, it\u2019s hard to track down those who are a slave\u2019s relatives, due to changes in a person\u2019s name, looking through previous owners, and so on. However, I think that some of them might be pleased that they have a non-human relative who supports their rights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, the three adults were in John\u2019s office, looking over the forms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting rules you have here, Mr. Wolfstone,\u201d said the naga. \u201cYou have in here that, in order for a person, or a family, to rent a home from you, that they basically have to be, or become, \u2018vegetarians\u2019. I don\u2019t know if that is something that you can enforce.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I have some very good plumbing to make sure of that,\" John said. \"I had special sensors placed in the toilets and garbage disposal units. If they detect certain things, which I am not going to say as to what those things be, an alarm will go off in this room, alerting me that someone in one of the houses, as well as which one, had violated the terms for living here. After that, I\u2019ll go to the residence and confront the violator. However, if you have a guest, let me know, and tell him the rules. If you have to, tell the guy I\u2019m a bit of a money grubber who would be upset if I lost any part of my investment, which is, in a very small way, somewhat true.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if we told a guest that you\u2019d kill them if they ate one of our neighbors, because you\u2019d lose money if that person got eaten, that would give them a good reason not to,\u201d the naga said, with a bit of a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be close enough,\" John said. \"Although, if you really want to scare him or her, tell them I\u2019d do it in front of their families and that I wouldn\u2019t eat them, no, I\u2019d tear them limb from limb, then I\u2019d take their family to be my personal \u2018toys\u2019 as it were.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s nasty,\u201d the dridder said, glad that her son wasn't with them then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I know,\" John said, agreeing with the woman. \"But that would give them a very good reason to follow my rules while they are under your roof. Of course, this place does have one small problem-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the doorbell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak of the devil,\u201d John said, getting up and walking out of the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga and dridder only heard a few words of the conversation between John and the visitor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome muffled words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m not interested.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more muffled words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thawap is heard followed by someone shouting, \u201cYou broke my nose you fucking asshole!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John saying, in a low deep voice, with a growl, \u201cBe glad I don\u2019t take your head and add you to my supper.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there are the sounds of someone running, a motor starting, screech of tires, crashing of mettle and wood, followed by an even faster revving of an engine and spinning tires, as a vehicle quickly drives off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, John comes back into the office, with a wolf-like appearance, and a set of six inch claws on one of his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTraveling salesman,\u201d he said, holding up a package of pills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then shifted back to his human form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what this packet says,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s see, \u2018Pleasure Enhancement. Ladies; your man will be like a giant. Men; your lady will squeal like a piggy. The two of you will pleasure each other all night long.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m going to have the need to use something like this. If a lover of mine wanted a giant, I\u2019d become one. If I wanted my lover to squeal like a piggy, I\u2019d take a pig-woman as my lover. These sex-enhancement companies get more and more ridiculous each year.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then tossed the packet down on the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should have told him a couple of renters of mine would have been interested,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only would they have taken care of him, I think they would have appreciated the thought of me sending them a gift, or two, and a meal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought that you wanted your renters to be vegetarians,\u201d said the naga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but I might make an exception, especially when it comes to traveling salesmen and priests that don\u2019t take a hint,\" John said, with a chuckle. \"Seriously, sometimes those guys can be worse than a horde of locusts. While they don\u2019t eat your crops and food, they certainly eat up one\u2019s time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest, they would be about the only humans that my parents would eat, especially if they didn\u2019t get the hints that my parents were not interested in what they were trying to sell, and if they didn\u2019t get the idea that they should have run instead of staying to argue with my parents,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, they wouldn\u2019t eat them in front of me and the others. About the only reason that I knew they did it was because I once saw my father burning some clothes and muttering something about how many salesmen and priests organizations could afford to lose. When I asked him about what he was talking about, he had talked about cooking instead, but I had seen the clothes, and knew that they were not some clothing that I and my siblings had outgrown, because these had looked like suits. Also, the only people that I knew wore suits were businessmen and salesmen. When I asked my mother if some people had been trying to rob the house recently, she told me that some people had been trying to steal something important from her and my father, time with each other. Needless to say, I kind of came to the conclusion that some salespeople had interrupted my mother and father while they had been having sex. Then again, they tended to be the only ones in the house, because everyone else was either at work or in school, between the hours of 8 am and 3 pm. Then again, I was seventeen at the time and had taken sexual education by that time. Ugh, hated those classes, same with human hunting, only passed them because the teachers didn\u2019t try to force me to rape some human girl. In fact, the only way I\u2019d have sex with someone was if the other wanted to do it with me. If she changed her mind, I\u2019d respect it, no matter if I had just kissed her, started to take her clothes off, had taken both hers and mine off, or even if my manhood was already in her womanhood, the moment she said stop, I would stop and pull out, as it were. If she said to continue, I would. When I handed my report in to the teacher on it, when she asked me why it took me so long to get through the whole thing, I said it was because I wanted to enhance my partner\u2019s pleasure, which was true.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what about the human hunting classes?\" the naga asked. \"How did you pass them?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I would hunt the human down, say hi and walk to my class with them,\" John said, matter of factly. \"When the teacher would ask me why I didn\u2019t eat the human, I\u2019d tell them that I was using the catch and release tactic. If they tried to force me to eat the human, I\u2019d give that teacher a quick history lesson on why it was best for them not to force me to do that, cause I\u2019d tell them about how my fifth grade teacher died, in great detail.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how did he die?\u201d the naga asked, worried about if the man was a murderer or some such thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuy tried to fail me, and a student I had been assigned to catch for a hunting class,\" John said, as the memory came to his mind. \"Something about being in that guy\u2019s stomach triggered something in me. Now, I could always turn into a werewolf form, ever since I was born, and I had tried clawing my way out. However, I became somewhat desperate, and wished I could get as tall as my mother, so I could escape, along with the human, which I was holding onto, so he wouldn\u2019t die. Somehow, for some reason, I started to grow, filling up my teacher\u2019s stomach. However, I didn\u2019t stop there, and I grew quite rapidly, and when I was done growing, not only had I caused the teacher to split open, and splatter on the walls of the room, I filled up, at least, half the classroom, which was twenty feet tall, fifty feet wide, and one hundred feet long. Needless to say, that was the last time anyone tried to fail me in that manner. Then again, practically every teacher feared me. The moment that they tried to \u2018discipline\u2019 a problem student, I\u2019d get out of my desk and quickly grow a few feet, so that they knew what I was capable of, and then claim the student as my \u2018pet\u2019. No one dared to argue against my claim. However, there was one teacher who never feared me, Mrs. Janus Clawfoot. She was one of my seventh grade teachers, and works at the school I work at. She had had the job for only a year when she met me. When she first saw me, I was in a losing fight with a senior by the name of Joseph Redblood, a blood-thirsty vampire who wanted me for his meal. He had grabbed me while I was in my human form and dragged me to the roof, so he could \u2018enjoy\u2019 his \u2018meal\u2019 in \u2018peace\u2019. At first, Janus didn\u2019t do anything, but when she saw my eyes, she saw my mother\u2019s eyes. My mother had been her teacher when she was in high school. This recognition caused her to gasp, which distracted Joseph long enough, as he looked at her, probably to ask if she wanted some of me to eat, for me to push him off of me. That was when she grabbed me, to protect me from him. Well, he attacked her, and broke one of her wings; the woman\u2019s a harpy you should know. He beat her pretty badly. However, I pulled him off of her, and forced him to try and finish me off before he switched targets. I had tossed him near the edge, but he recovered and charged me. Well, I hit him once, with a roundhouse kick, straight to the chest, and sent him, quite literally, into the lobby of the nearby hospital, a good four miles east of the school. Guy was in a full body caste for over a year. Unfortunately, the Redblood family is very powerful, both financially, and politically. They demanded that I be turned over to them for a proper punishment. However, just as they were about to take me away, my mother and father showed up, with all of my brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, and so on. Well, my father worked out an acceptable compromise; my parents would pay all of Joseph\u2019s medical expenses, as long as only the school took any disciplinarian actions it felt were appropriate to the situation. Well, the school wouldn\u2019t dare punish Joseph, and anger the Redblood family, so they punished me. I was sentenced to be placed under the direct supervision of one of the teachers, to be their slave until my time was up. However, no teacher would dare take me, they all said that I was too dangerous for them to handle. That was when Janus showed up, broken wing and all. She said that she would be my warden, as it were. Well, that shocked the entire school, that a relatively new, and somewhat crippled, teacher could handle one of the most troublesome students in the entire school. Well, all I can say is this, she may have kicked and scratched me in public, but when we were at her house, it was almost as if I was back at home, without my siblings or parents of course. Her husband, a dragon, was a pretty nice guy, never really forcing me to do something that I didn\u2019t want to do, especially when Janus told him that I had saved her life. Of course, after I served my time, I still caused plenty of trouble, protecting students from others, as well as over zealous teachers, which kept on placing me on various peoples\u2019 preverbal hit lists, though Mrs. Clawfoot was the only one that carried out any disciplinarian actions against me. To be honest, she was my inspiration to become a teacher, and I tend to use her disciplinarian tactics on troublesome students, threats, the occasional beating, and of course, placing them under my direct supervision.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do these Redbloods still cause you and your family problems?\u201d the naga asked, relieved that his landlord wasn't a murderer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot directly, they wouldn\u2019t want to do that, considering that the heir to the Redbloods\u2019 fortune is one of my students,\" John said. \"They make a move against my family, and I\u2019ll claim him faster than one could say \u2018leash law\u2019. Then, if they tried to take me to court, they would lose, financially anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust how wealthy are they?\u201d the dridder asked, worried that this group of vampires could threaten her son in some manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are wealthy enough to bribe several dozen of this city\u2019s politicians anyways,\" John said. \"They controlled many of this city\u2019s stockyards, before they were destroyed, as well as several of the restaurants that served humans as meals. That was where they made most of their money at. My parents though, they ran orphanages, shelters, and various other such places. In fact, there has been a financial war between my family and the Redbloods, ever since my father purchased a dozen boys and girls from a stockyard that they ran. That was over fifty years ago. Nowadays, I hold the upper hand in our personal feud against each other. All I have to do is claim James Redblood as my personal pet and I\u2019d own them. Of course, I could use a more suitable approach and place him under my direct supervision for a month. Boy\u2019s racked up enough detentions that he hasn\u2019t served to warrant it. Now that would be better, might make him half-way decent to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more talking, the couple picked up the forms, said their good-byes and left, the dridder having their son ride on her abdomen. After that, John served supper to the young ones, asked Julia what she thought of the boy, and a while after that, all four went to bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day passed in a similar manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga and dridder, and their son, moved into a home for them, met up with the giant couple, who had brought along their baby daughter, and talked with them. A few more families showed up, also interested in renting houses from John, a group of werewolves, a family of cat-like creatures, and, much to Julia\u2019s fear, a set of kitsunes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, they were all friendly, especially since the giants came over when they heard Julia practically scream at the sight of the kitsunes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Julia had calmed down, thanks to Tawna\u2019s help, John had ordered out for some very expensive cake and ice cream, which they had after supper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while after that, the students went to bed while John sat down with Julia, to have a little talk with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJulia, you need to learn to control your fear about kitsunes,\u201d said John. \u201cNow tell me, why do you fear them? Something tells me that they did more that just buy you for their son to eat for breakfast.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why exactly,\u201d Julia said. \u201cThe young one did try to eat me, but his father, he did something that made me feel wrong.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know,\" Julia said. \"But it just felt wrong. I thought I was going to die.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChild, please tell me,\" John said, a look of concern on his face. \"What did this kitsune do to you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember being in a dark room. He came in and I heard a zipper unzipping. He placed something that was like a warm hot dog into my mouth and told me to suck on it. Some warm liquid came out of it and he forced me to swallow it. It felt like an eternity had passed before he took the thing out of my mouth. Then he said something like, \u2018Best oral I\u2019ve ever had.\u2019 After that, I was left in the dark, until the son took me to the school and tried to eat me when you showed up and saved my life,\u201d the young girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Julia buried her face into John\u2019s chest and started to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose bastards,\u201d John thought, as he tried to comfort Julia. \u201cMr. Twotail had better not show up on my doorstep, because I\u2019ll do that to his son, in front of him, before I tear him limb from limb and eat him in front of his son.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time he had felt this angry about someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJulia,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat that man did to you was wrong. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that you should fear all of the kitsunes that are out there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I get over it?\u201d Julia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, your Aunt Clara can help you out somewhat,\" John said. \"As a shape-shifter, she can turn into any form she wants, including, in my opinion, a very attractive female kitsune. While she wouldn\u2019t be the real thing, her behavior is similar to the real version of whatever form she is. I\u2019ll call her, and your uncle, tomorrow after school is over.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John picked Julia up and carried her to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet some sleep child,\u201d he said. \u201cTomorrow, you will have to start to get used to, and hopefully over, what it is you fear.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Monday morning, John awakens to see the sun shining in his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgot to pull the shade down again,\u201d he said, getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the memories of last night\u2019s conversation with Julia hit him, as if he had been shot in the heart with a silver bullet. (Of course, the silver wouldn\u2019t kill him, but getting shot through the heart would kill anyone anyways.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he thought that Julia had just been starved, or maybe beaten, but for someone to do what that monster (and not because of his race) had done, to him, that was even worse than someone just trying to eat Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to growl and started to breath heavily. His claws grew out of his nails and he started to grow himself. It was only when he hit his head on the ceiling when he realized what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, he realized just how upset he was. The ceiling was twenty feet above his bed, which was five feet high; perfect for him to sit up on comfortably when he was in his werewolf form. He then began to think about the meadow, which helped him to calm down, somewhat. He then looked in the mirror and gasped. The reflection seamed to be something from his nightmares. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could even hear the monster\u2019s voice, telling him to kill, and eat, and rape, and destroy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John shook his head and said, \u201cNo John. You are a man, not a blood thirsty monster. You control the beast, the beast doesn\u2019t control you. Humans are people, not food, or slaves, or pets. Everyone is equal. No one has any advantage over anyone. No one has disadvantages against anyone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept on saying things like this, until he became small enough to walk out of his room and become more human like. He then went back into his room, grabbed his clothes, and went to the bathroom to take his shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he took his shower, John took a good look at himself, as he shifted between his human and werewolf forms. His werewolf form took after his father\u2019s, with jet black fur. His human form looked similar to his mother\u2019s body, if she was born human and a man, with brown eyes and brown hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I a man?\u201d he asked himself, looking like a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr a monster?\u201d he though, shifting into his werewolf form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe I\u2019m both,\u201d he said, shifting into a mixture with human and werewolf features. \u201cNow what was it that father told me before I left for the university?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to remember, remember that day, as he was waiting for the bus to take him to the university. He remembered his siblings, and the older ones\u2019 children, saying their good byes and good lucks. He remembered his mother kissing him, and having to wash her lipstick off afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he remembered it, his elderly father, coming up to him, and hugging him. Then, he said the most important words that John had ever heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had said, \u201cSon, it isn\u2019t your age or species that makes you a man. It is who you are and what you do that makes you a man, or a true monster, and you, my boy, you are no monster. You are a true man where it counts. You make me proud to be your father, so, get good grades, mind your professors, make some friends, and maybe a girlfriend or two that you will marry and have kids with.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, maybe that last bit of advice was a little much,\u201d John thought, back in the present. \u201cBut, he is right on the rest of it. It is what I do that makes me a man or a monster, and I know I am a man.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he finished his shower and got dressed, John got the young ones up, so that they could take their showers and get dressed. He then got breakfast ready, bacon, eggs, sausage, pancakes, milk, and juice. As he set the table and served the food, he asked his students a question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me class,\" he said. \"What is the difference between being capable of doing something, and actually doing something?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTawna raised her hand and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t being capable of doing something mean, that you could do the action?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that is correct,\" John said, with a smile. \"Justian, would you care to answer the rest?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\" Justian started to say. \"Doing something means that the person is doing what they were thinking about doing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct,\" John said. \"Now, tell me, what do we call the things that happen after we do something, Tawna?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose would be consequences, sir,\" the dog-like werewolf said. \"They can be both positive and/or negative.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is very good Tawna,\" John said, as he looked at her. \"Justian, could you tell us something that you did that has given you both sets of consequences?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it was when I and Tawna tried to eat those classmates of ours and you placed us under you supervision. To be placed under a teacher\u2019s personal supervision is to be a very serious punishment,\" Justain said. \"However, Tawna and I seem to be learning more than what you\u2019d normally teach us in class.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John smiled and said, \u201cThank you for saying that. It isn\u2019t often that a student will say something like that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John\u2019s expression turned somewhat serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever,\" he said. \"Today you will learn some of the most important lessons of your life. One is learning how to deal with your enemies, peacefully. Today, I\u2019ll be placing Samual Redblood under my supervision, especially if he is rude today.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Tawna and Justian had looks of fear on their faces. The seventeen year old vampire was the most dangerous and feared, and hated, student in the school. None of the teachers dared to discipline him, except for John and Janus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he saw the fear in his students\u2019 eyes, John said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry too much about him. A very powerful wizard friend of mine, Julia\u2019s uncle, will be here today, along with his wife, who should, hopefully, be able to help Julia out with her fears. That is the second lesson, being there for a friend in their time of need. This lesson is the most important one you can learn, for anyone can be a friend in fair weather, but true friends will stick together, even in the stormiest of storms.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John sat down and started eating his breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, John took Julia and his students to school. However, he had had to stop a few muggers, rapists, and murderers along the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, how I wish there police officers who did their jobs and protected ALL citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead they probably assist the criminals, especially for a piece of the action.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe that one boy\u2019s father could help,\u201d said Julia. \u201cHe told me that his daddy was a cop back at their old home.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at Julia and said, \u201cYou know, you might be on to something there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then kissed her head and said, \u201cYou definitely got your father\u2019s brains, well, that\u2019s the impression I\u2019m getting from the feelings your mother left behind in me when she passed on.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John turned to face forward, a light shade of red on his face. He had never thought of men as sexual partners, but the feelings that that woman had left behind could make even a gay man blush at the thought of seeing someone else\u2019s version of having sex with the person that they had loved. While the feelings weren\u2019t strong enough to affect his sexuality, they were somewhat embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the group finally got to the school, John looked at his students and said, \u201cNow, I must warn you, I will act harshly towards you in class. This is so that the other teachers don\u2019t think I\u2019m some soft pushover. So, if I hit you or do something along those lines, know this, I honestly think that you are among some of the best students I\u2019ve ever had, though I do expect you to apologize to Tiffany and Tom for your behavior the other day. After all, you know about what they almost went through, and I know that you are sorry for nearly putting them through that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustian and Tawna just looked at each other and nodded. With that, the group went to John\u2019s, Mr. Wolfstone\u2019s, class, after John took a quick trip to check on something, and to hand the janitor a wrapped package, as well as to tell him to keep his supply closet locked next time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He also saw that Samual was not in class, again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember what I told you two,\u201d John said, as he grabbed Tawna and Justian by their ears and practically dragged them to a pair of seats near the front of the class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou best behave yourselves,\u201d he then said, in a deep threatening voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned to face the rest of the class and said, \u201cToday we have a new student joining our class. I expect that you will all be on your best behavior around her. Otherwise you will face someone who on a good day is worse than me on a bad day, her uncle. He is a very powerful dark wizard who makes me afraid for my life and that is something few people happen to be capable of doing. And if you think that\u2019s bad, his wife scares the shit out of him. She is a very powerful shape-shifter who will make you RUE the day you even set eyes on her. So, I expect that you will be nice to her, especially if you value your lives.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned towards the doorway and said, in a friendly voice, \u201cYou can come in now Julia, and welcome to my Philosophy class.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Julia came in, somewhat nervously. She had never really seen John act like he had just did, in a dark and foreboding manner. However, John just gave her a quick smile that reassured her somewhat, that he was still the same man who had saved her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his face became that of Mr. Wolfstone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me take you to your seat,\u201d he said, in a deep voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class gasped when they saw where Julia was sitting. The seat he placed her at was between Tawna and Justian, the very seat that Samual Redblood always stole and sat in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Wolfstone then looked at the class and said, \u201cAnyone who steals this seat from Miss Julia will find himself, or herself, under my direct supervision for a month, unless of course her uncle decides to use that person as a new test subject. The guy is always looking for \u2018volunteers\u2019 to test out his potions and experiments.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tone that Mr. Wolfstone had used when he said \u201cvolunteers\u201d caused the class to gulp. Being a scientist\u2019s, or a wizard\u2019s, or some such person\u2019s, volunteer, or test subject, was a highly dangerous job, as most were just lucky, enough, to just, barely, survive the length of the terms of the contract that they had signed for the person to do the experiments on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Samual showed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Wolfstone looked at him and said, \u201cWell Mister Redblood. Given that you showed up ten minutes late, and had a few extra days as well, I expect that you made your report so excellent, that it is worthy to be placed in the historical archives at City Hall.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew you professor,\u201d the vampire said. \u201cI found out what really happened. You attacked my uncle because he was about to drink the blood of some bird-brained teacher that tried to interrupt his meal, you. I also found out that my family was about to take you as theirs for assaulting my uncle when your father cut a deal with them. It must have been embarrassing for your father to have to pay for your freedom, teacher.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John grabbed his desk, as his claws grew, putting holes in the wood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky that it is against school policy for teachers to just kill their students,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, you would be so dead, there\u2019d be nothing left of you, not even feces, because of that insult about my father.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he smiled and said, \u201cHowever, it is against student conduct to insult a teacher, past or present that was only doing their job, which is to protect and teach their students. Besides, Mrs. Janus Clawfoot was returning a favor she owed my mother, who was her teacher when she was in high school herself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d James said, as he walked towards \u2018his\u2019 seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was about to pull Julia out of it, Mr. Wolfstone said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you, Samual. That seat has been assigned to Miss Julia there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho cares? As a vampire, I am superior to a human, who is nothing more than prey,\u201d Samual said, baring his fangs towards Julia, scaring her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I care,\u201d Tawna said, standing up, facing Samual from across the desk. \u201cYou even touch her and I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really,\u201d Samual said. \u201cYou and what pack?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe,\u201d said a deep threatening voice, which caused Samual to turn around, where his face had an encounter with Justian\u2019s fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole class gasped in shock. No one had ever dared to stand up to Samual, let alone hit him. John looked at the two, and a bit of pride showed on his face. However, as he looked at Samual, who was covering his nose with a bloody hand, he could tell that the fight was just getting started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to intervene,\u201d he said, rushing towards the pair, who were about to really start swinging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFighting in the classroom is not tolerated,\u201d he said, in a deep and dangerous voice, as he grabbed the combatants\u2019 throats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Justian, winked, with a slight smile, and said, still in his deadly voice, \u201cMr. Orangefur, you and Miss Bloodwolf have just earned your selves yet another week under my direct supervision.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then dropped Justian to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\" he said, his voice still having a threatening tone to it. \"Unless everyone else would like detention with Mrs. Clawfoot again, get back in your seats.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clatter of chairs and desks scrapping is heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mr. Wolfstone looked at Samual, and saw the fear in the teen\u2019s eyes. The reflection in them told him why; he had transformed into his werewolf form and was easily twelve feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Mr. Redblood,\u201d he said, breathing heavily on Samual, causing him to start to smell like wolf breath. \u201cThe way I see it, you have three choices. You can work for Julia\u2019s uncle, who is a very powerful, and dangerous, dark wizard. Or, you can be the first student I have ever \u2018failed\u2019 as it were, where you become nothing more than little pieces of vampire feces.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Samual\u2019s face paled even more than it already was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr,\" John contenued. \"You can spend the next month, under my direct supervision, following my rules, living in my house, eating what I say you can eat, and anything else that I say. Now, what will it be, being a test subject for Julia\u2019s uncle, being the first \u2018failure\u2019 of this class, or being under my supervision for a month?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment, Samual realized the power Mr. Wolfstone had over his fate. No matter what option he chose, he would lose. A wizard could do anything to him, being digested would kill him, and being under a teacher\u2019s supervision would make him a slave until his time was up. However, of the three, being Mr. Wolfstone\u2019s slave seemed to be the most survivable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take being placed under your supervision,\u201d he said, lowering his eyes, in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood choice,\u201d Mr. Wolfstone said, as he dropped Samual. \u201cYou will lie down on the floor next to Julia\u2019s desk, like the dog you are. She is your master. If she tells you to fetch an apple for her, it better be the reddest and juiciest apple you can find. If she says for you to get her a box of crayons, it had best be the biggest one you can find with all of the colors imaginable. If she tells you to shove your head up your ass, well, you had best be one hell of a contortionist.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Samual ran and lied down beside Julia\u2019s desk, as if he was going to play a board game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Mr. Wolfstone said. \u201cI said, \u2018Lay down like the dog you are.\u2019 That is not how a dog lays down. Now do what I do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mr. Wolfstone got on his back, stuck his arms and legs up in the air, as if he was a puppy waiting for someone to scratch his belly, with his tongue hanging out, with a puppy-like expression on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at Samual and said, \u201cDo it just like that, or else. I don\u2019t like misbehaving pets, especially in my classroom, and even more so in my house.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samual got on his back and assumed the position, Mr. Wolfstone stood up and walked over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t you look cute,\u201d he said kneeling down to look at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then pulled a collar, with a name tag, out of his pocket, and placed a claw under Samual\u2019s shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, you best stay in that position when you aren\u2019t doing something for Julia,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019ll rip your clothes off and place this collar, which has your name on it, faster than you and say \u2018Down boy\u2019. So I would do what I and Julia happen to say, if I were you, which I am not.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mr. Wolfstone stood up, shrank and turned back into his human form, looked back at his class, with a icy-cold glare, went to his desk, got out a text book, took down a number, handed it to Julia, and then sat down at his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow class,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you just witnessed was a mixture of Reverse Domination and Submission through Domination and Intimidation. In the one, the person who initiates combat seems to hold the upper hand until the attacked pulls out a trump card. This trump card can be, during a debate, a superior argument, or in an actual physical fight, a distraction happens or an ally shows up to help the attacked out, which can be at times one and the same. During the other, one person goes on the offensive, either by the sheer weight of their argument, or actual combat abilities in a fight. Of course, it always helps to be the holder of several cards that are in your favor, literal or figuratively speaking. For instance, when Samual was facing and confronting Tawna, he was unable to realize that Justian stood up and walked behind him, when Justian made his second move, catching Samual off guard. As for my confrontation with Samual, the force of my discussion, and the fact that I held, and still hold, his fate in my hands, he decided that it would be wiser to submit to me and become my slave for the month, instead of the other to options, which are still on the table Samual, which were to either be the first student I have ever \u2018failed\u2019 by eating him, or being a test subject for my wizard friend. Then again, if someone murdered my sibling and kidnapped their child, I\u2019d be angry to. The guy spent ten years trying to track her down before I found her, halfway down the throat of James Twotail. Also, on a personal note, if I encounter his father out on the streets, he\u2019s going to be dead. What that, scum, did was something lower than even insects. Heck, I doubt I\u2019m going to tell Julia\u2019s uncle what that man did, if only to spare his miserable life. Needless to say, I\u2019m not going to ask him what he did to those who kidnapped Julia and murdered her parents.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he told the class to get their books out and start reading the pages that he thought was appropriate to the situation that they had just seen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was sitting alone, as usual, in the cafeteria. Then again, with his reputation, everyone avoided him, both teachers and students alike. However, today became somewhat different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I sit here?\u201d said a young female voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked up and saw the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She was human, with no trace of non-human blood, or magic, in her. She also looked to be in her early to mid twenties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d he said, scooting over, so the woman could have a warm spot. \u201cI could use, and welcome, a bit of company.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the woman said, sitting down on the spot where John had moved from. \u201cThe teachers\u2019 table over there was full. I was going to sit down next to that harpy, but she said that the spot was taken by a, how do I say this, a naked chameleon friend of hers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John looked up and saw Janus smile at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled and said, \u201cNo offence Miss, but that seat was, at the very least, empty then.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d the woman asked, as she looked back at the table, and realizing that there wasn't even a plate at the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know Janus,\" John said. \"She\u2019s a very good friend of mine. Of course, given how you are human, and how I\u2019m mostly human, she probably thought that you\u2019d be more comfortable with me than with the others.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by mostly human?\" the woman asked. \"You look human to me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks are not everything,\u201d John said, turning his head and turning it into that of a werewolf and back into that of a human. He then laid his hand on the table and grew it six times its original size, before shrinking it back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d the woman asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComplicated,\u201d John said, turning back to eat his sandwich. \u201cMy parents were both half human, with my father being part werewolf and my mother being part giant.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you can turn into both?\u201d the woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\" John said, as he took a bite out of his sandwich. \"I even got a combination form as well, but I try not to use that very often. To say it scares me is an understatement. However, despite what I am, and sometimes act like, I\u2019m normally a decent person. Then again, given how my parents raised me to treat everyone as equals that can be understandable.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, um, do you ever, uh, eat humans?\u201d the woman asked, nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be honest,\" John said. \"I have. I think it to be the most delicious thing I have ever eaten. However, I\u2019ve only eaten human flesh as part of a meal once, and that once was enough for me. I became very sick when I realized what it was. After that, I avoided it as much as possible, which was relatively easy because my parents rarely ate humans themselves. Then again, they tended to buy up young humans that were in the stockyards and give them second chances.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how come people say that you are dangerous?\" the woman asked. \"You look like a nice guy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce again, looks are not everything,\" John said. \"They are correct to say that I am, highly, dangerous. Almost everyone in the school is afraid of what I could do to them. This fear of me comes from what I did when I went to school here as a student, and what I did during my first year as a teacher here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what did you do?\u201d the woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say I had a reputation as a troublesome protector,\" John said, as he looked at the woman. \"Basically, I\u2019d be the troublesome student that the teachers would watch, instead of those with poor grades or didn\u2019t get to class on time. I assaulted several teachers, including the principal, when they tried to \u2018discipline\u2019 problem students. Then, in the fifth grade, I killed a teacher who tried to fail me and another student. At that point, every teacher feared me, all except one, Janus. I saved her life in the seventh grade when a senior attacked her when she tried to protect me from him. Because of him, Janus\u2019s one wing was broke, and several of her ribs had been fractured. However, the damage I gave him would have killed him, if my kick hadn\u2019t, by chance, sent him straight into the nearby hospital. Well, everyone was shocked by what just I, all by myself, with only one kick, had done. The guy\u2019s parents tried to claim me as theirs, so that I would be \u2018properly\u2019 punished. Thankfully, my parents came to an arrangement with them, paid the guy\u2019s medical bills and I was placed under a teacher\u2019s supervision. However, the problem then was to find a teacher willing to take me. Thankfully, Janus came to my rescue, again, and offered to take me and become my warden, as it were.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou owe a lot to her,\u201d the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I do,\" John said, as he looked back at Janus, and smiled at the harpy. \"In fact, I became a teacher because of her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, can you tell me why the school still fears you?\u201d the human asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple really,\" John said, as he looked back at the human. \"The gym teacher tried to fail a student of mine, so I persuaded him to change his mind, by doing the Heimlich maneuver on him, to get that student of mine out of his stomach. However, he didn\u2019t like being forced to change the student\u2019s grade from failed to just passing, so after school he tried to attack me in front of everyone. Of course, as you can probably guess, we had need of a new gym teacher when I was done with him. The guy\u2019s in a wheelchair now. As for the students, two won\u2019t look at the flagpole during the Pledge of Allegiance, and everyone else, who had seen what I did to them, can\u2019t get the picture out of their heads when they look at the flagpole.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\" the woman asked. \"What did you do to them?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the two had been sneaking around during lunchtime, eating students, when I caught them and forced them to let the other students out of their stomachs,\" John said, with a low sigh, as he remembered what he did. \"After that, given that the \u2018sexual education\u2019 class was going on, I tied them in a certain position that I thought was fitting, and tied them to the top of the flagpole, where everyone could see those two young men, practically, giving each other oral.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really did that to them?\u201d the woman asked, her eyes practically bulging out of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\" John said \"I really did that to them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least I know why no one wants to sit next to you,\u201d the woman said, starting to get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d John said, as he grabbed the woman\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHANDS OFF YOU MONSTER!\u201d the woman shouted, slapping him across the face with her free hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the entire lunchroom turned their heads and looked at them. They had never seen anyone hit Mr. Wolfstone and get away with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, John just let go of the woman\u2019s hand, the handprint on his face starting to swell, as the woman walked away with a huff. As John watched her go away, he sighed, unhappily, as he lowered his head and conversation resumed. He could hear the students talking about what they had just saw, that a woman, a normal human at that, had hit the most fearsome teacher in the school and gotten away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, Julia came in and saw him, sitting alone, with a large red handprint on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked sitting down next to him, with her own lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had worse kid,\u201d John said, as he gingerly placed his hand on the bruise. \u201cI remember one time I broke my tail, while I was in my werewolf form, because I was fooling around. I couldn\u2019t retract it back into my body, when I tried to go human. Of course, everyone in the first grade thought that it was funny to see a human with a wolf\u2019s tail, with a splint on it. Then there was that time I had fleas. They kept me up all night, itching and scratching at them, until my father, with the help of my older brothers, forced me to take a flea bath. Then there was that time that a witch miscast a spell and my hair caught on fire. It took a month to grow back, in both my human and werewolf forms.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he chuckled, until the woman from earlier came back to the table, saw Julia, grabbed her hand and said, \u201cCome with me Julia. That man is nothing more than a monster.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman started to pull her away, Julia managed to slip her hand out of the woman\u2019s grasp and said, \u201cNo Miss Janelle. John is not a monster. He saved my life and took me to his home and took care of me. He is more human than those humans that sold me to a stockyard.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Julia wrapped her arms around John\u2019s chest, looking at Miss Janelle, as if daring her to pry her arms from John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the entire cafeteria turned their heads to look at the scene. It was highly unusual for someone to say that a non-human was more human than an actual human. While there were humans who were reclassified as non-human, the reverse had never happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Julia wasn\u2019t paying attention to this as she continued to speak out in favor of John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good man,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s nice, kind-hearted, helpful, considerate and more. He helped reunite me with my real family, was there for me when I said good-bye to my real mother, kept me safe when he almost lost control of himself, asked my uncle, his best friend, a wizard, to put a barrier on my room to keep me protected and even more. So if you want to call him a monster, go right ahead Miss Janelle. However, I know, deep down inside, he is more human that any other human I have met, maybe even more than you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, everyone gasped. To call someone a human was to imply that they were weak, and thus was considered an insult. However, this little girl had called the most fearsome teacher in the school a human, as if it was a compliment of the highest order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John just chuckled and said quietly, \u201cFrom the mouth of a child, the greatest of wisdom is spoken.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at Miss Janelle and said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t try arguing with her. As a teacher of Philosophy I can tell that her argument carries a lot more weight than anything you can come up with.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not even human,\" the woman, Janelle, said. \"You're just a monster passing for a human.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, my father once told me something,\" John said, as he cleared his throat. \"\u2018Your race is only what a person is, that con never change. However, the things that you do will determine if you are a man or a monster.\u2019 So tell me, is a person who takes care of a child, that is not his own, a man or a monster?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Miss Janelle just walked away, in a bit of a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs conversations resumed, John looked at Julia and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I going to do with you?\u201d he said, with a chuckle. \u201cDisobeying the orders of a teacher is a sure way to get you into trouble.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Julia said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t just let her say those nasty things about you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gave him a hug, as he carefully wrapped his arms around her, not caring who saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of the day went by, John could hear people whispering, in the classroom, in bathrooms, around the corner, everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard that the new human teacher punched him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I heard that he\u2019s taking care of a human girl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I heard that the girl called him human and he kissed her for it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs the girl his pet?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s the niece of a very powerful wizard.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I heard that she\u2019s made Samual Redblood her pet.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing; I saw Justian and Tawna get ready to fight him when he tried to take Julia\u2019s seat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe they are her slaves.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, that really makes perfect sense.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe must be a witch or something, especially since Mr. Wolfstone is friendly to her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe could be scared of her power.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo he isn\u2019t. That girl has no magic in her. If she did I\u2019d sense it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n By the end of the day, everyone was giving him strange looks, faculty, staff, teachers, students, they all looked at him funny, much as if he had suddenly grown a second head or tail.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Remind me to add a couple of points to one of your lowest test scores for it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked at Julia and said, \u201cThanks for calling me a human. Even if I did take offense if someone else called me that, from you, it sounded like it was the highest of praises.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you two just hear that?\u201d he asked, looking at Tawna and Justian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d they said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John perked his ears up, turning them into werewolf ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere it is again,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll go check it out. Head to the house, and Samual, you try running away, your family line will die out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John started running, his legs and feet those of a werewolf. As he reached the spot, he turned his legs and feet back to those of a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard it clearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo don\u2019t, don\u2019t do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a woman, but not just any woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cJanelle,\u201d John said, under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rounded a corner, John saw that Janelle was in a dead end alley, with her back up against the wall, with her clothing torn in several places. Standing before her was a lizard-man, a werewolf, a cat-man, and a kitsune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile John didn\u2019t know the other three, the smell of the kitsune was very familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwotail,\u201d he said, with his voice deep and angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the group to turn around, and look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLet the woman pass and I\u2019ll leave you alone for today,\" he said. \"Otherwise, your blood will run red in the streets.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really,\u201d said Twotail. \u201cAnd just how will you kill me? Will it be with your weak tiny human teeth and fingernails?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\" John said, as he looked the group over. \"I\u2019ll snap the neck of the lizard, impale the cat\u2019s chest, and rip the head of the dog off. As for you, I\u2019ll tear you limb from limb.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this female to you?\" Twotail asked. \"Is she a mate that you like to have sex with?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\" John said, as he looked the kitsune in the eyes. \"She's just a college from work and it\u2019s your friends I\u2019d kill for her. You, I\u2019d kill you for someone else.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\" the kitsune asked. \"A lover of yours I ate?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\" John said, with a bit of anger in his voice. \"It would be a twelve year old red headed human girl with blue eyes that you forced to have oral sex with you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU STOLE MY SON\u2019S MEAL!\" the kitsune shouted. \"GET HIM BOYS!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the group rushed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, John just stood his ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the lizard-man and twisted the man\u2019s head, snapping his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the body aside, he grabbed the cat-man, grew his claws, and stabbed the man through the chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then saw the werewolf start to run away, so he turned into his own werewolf form and jumped ahead of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the man, John placed his mouth over the man\u2019s head and tore it off with his powerful jaws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he spat the bloody thing out, John quickly jumped back into the alleyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then grabbed Twotail and slammed him against the brick wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis could have all been avoided if you only did what I asked you to,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-p-please, d-d-don\u2019t k-k-kill m-m-me,\u201d said Twotail. \u201cI-I-I h-h-happen t-t-to h-h-have a w-w-wife and a-a-a y-y-young s-s-son, m-m-Mister, b-b-buddy, s-s-sir, I-I-I\u2019ll d-d-do w-w-what-e-e-ever y-y-you w-w-want.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then,\" John said with a deep voice. \"For them, I won\u2019t kill you, and I will spare your life.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Twotail breathed a sigh of relief, until he felt John grab his arm and pull it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaaaahhhh, MY GOD! I THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAL! YOU SAID YOU WOULDN\u2019T KILL ME!\u201d he screamed, in absolute agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m not,\u201d John said, pulling off a leg. \u201cYou\u2019re the one that didn\u2019t ask me not to tear you limb from limb. All you said was for me to not kill you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John tore off the man\u2019s other leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnow this Twotail,\" he said, whispering in the man's ears. \"If you somehow survive, if you, or your family, don\u2019t stop raping and eating little girls, I will come back, and finish what I started, and do the same to your wife and take your son to be my personal sex toy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, John tore the man\u2019s other arm off and dropped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood riddance to bad rubbish,\u201d he said, shifting back to his human form and walking out of the alley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something rushed at him and caused him to lose his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank you, thank you (repeats saying \u2018thank you\u2019 half a dozen more times, at least, very rapidly, to the point it sounds like one really long word) mister! I thought those monsters were going to rape and eat me. Oh thank you, thank you,\u201d said Janelle, in a rapid and somewhat nervous manner, not really looking at him. \u201cHow can I repay, (then she looked at his face) y-y-you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just smiled as he looked at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow tell me,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was a monster, would I have saved you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-n-no, y-y-you w-w-wouldn\u2019t d-d-do s-s-something l-l-like t-that,\u201d Janelle said, with a nervous stutter, as she started to back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\" John said. \"Unless of course, I wanted you all to myself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he transformed into his werewolf form, causing Janelle to collapse and soil herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t eat me,\u201d she said, trying to crawl away, causing her clothes to tear more than they already were. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I called you a monster earlier.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, John just grabbed her and helped her to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow who said I was going to eat you?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did,\u201d Janelle answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I did,\" John said. \"But I meant it in the context that the only reason that a monster would save you from another monster would be to either rape and/or eat you themselves. However, there are only certain things that classify me as a monster, and eating and raping people are not a part of them. Now hop on my back, you are in no condition to be out walking alone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John turned around and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, how am I supposed to stay on your back?\u201d Janelle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just turned his head and said, \u201cJust crawl between my shirt and back. When you stick your head out the neck, the shirt will do the rest. Given the fact that I have several different forms, and the fact that I prefer to wear clothes, I buy clothing made for shape-shifters, expensive but worth every bit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, this thing will morph around me and cause me to hold onto you, until you let me out,\u201d Janelle said, still nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter that than walking around town half naked and covered in blood,\u201d John said, as he looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what about you?\" Janelle asked. \"You\u2019re covered in blood to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\" John said. \"But no one\u2019s going to ask how a werewolf got blood on his shirt. Not unless they want to become part of it anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Janell started to say,\u201cWell, what about-\u201d when a voice shouts, \u201cHey Bob! Free Meals! I just found a lizard, a cat, a dog, and a fox!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYum,\" said another voice. \"I just LOVE fox meat!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud scream is heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\" said the first voice. \"He was still alive.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not anymore,\u201d said the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John looked at Janelle and said, \u201cScavengers. You can always count on them to clean up a mess. Now hurry, before they smell the blood on you and come for you. They won\u2019t bother me, because I could eat them instead.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, just as Janelle got to where she was to be, to stay on John\u2019s back, a couple of vulture-like harpies landed in front of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey buddy,\u201d said the one. \u201cDid you leave a few bodies in that alley over there?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\" John said. \"I bit off a little more than I could eat. What\u2019s it to you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d said the other. \u201cHere is your bill and here is our card. You can sign your name on the dotted line, using one of your claws and the blood one your shirt.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at the bill, smiled, and said, as he took the card, \u201cHow about I give you double the amount, and we\u2019ll forget the name?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, an anonymous donation,\" said the first. \"That will do, thank you sir.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John handed the men a wad of cash, and watched as the vultures took off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d Janelle asked, poking her head out of the shirt\u2019s neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\"John asked.\"Are you worried about me bribing them?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Janelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\" John said. \" All that I did was just donate some money to the Sanitation Department, that\u2019s all. They\u2019re a little underfunded anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John started walking towards his house, meeting up with the young ones on the way, and grabbing Samual and carrying him by his shirt collar.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAh, home sweet home,\u201d John said, as he opened the door to his house. \u201cYou three kids get to work on your homework, while I find a place to put, \u2018Samantha\u2019, (Samual) at. After that, I need to help another guest of ours to get cleaned up and dressed. Then, I need to make a phone call to some friends of mine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter John tossed \u201cSamantha\u201d into the cellar, thinking that it was an appropriate place to put \u2018her\u2019, he went upstairs and into one of the other guestrooms he had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen John sat down, he pressed a button on the collar, causing the shirt to be absorbed into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Janelle,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can climb down now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then heard the springs in the bed creak and felt the woman get off of his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, clothes,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere can I get some clothes?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn pointed a finger over his shoulder, as he wasn\u2019t looking at Janelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver there,\u201d he said, politely. \u201cIn that closet are clothes for women. I\u2019m not sure if any will fit, but I bought then for my sisters, nieces, and the like, for when they spend a couple of days with me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, John,\u201d Janelle said, nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Janelle,\u201d John said, a slight blush developing under the fur on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the closest he had been to a naked, or nearly naked, woman since his last \u2018Sexual Education\u2019 class in high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remembered what had happened in the alley, in full detail, and suddenly felt sick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOHMYGOD,\u201d he said, lying down on the bed. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m about to throw up. Quick, get to the others. They will help you with what is needed. Now hurry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Janelle was confused by what John had said, until she saw his eyes. They were full of fear and feverish. When he said \u201cHurry\u201d again, Janelle ran out of the room, looking for someone to help her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, just as Janelle reached the bottom of the stairs, she ran into Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry,\u201d she said, quickly. \u201cJohn\u2019s sick. I think he\u2019s got a fever or something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Julia shouted, \u201cTawna, Justian, come quick. John\u2019s sick.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, a flash of orange fur zoomed past the pair, heading up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s right Tawna,\u201d shouted a young male voice. \u201cI think he has what we had the other day and he the night before that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas he lost control of himself like he did the other night?\u201d asked a young female voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the young man. \u201cBut he might be. The guy\u2019s got a death grip on the bed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet Julia and the woman and take them to Julia\u2019s room, they\u2019ll be safe there,\" the owner of the young female voice said. \"After that, get a bucket from the bathroom and a wet washcloth. I\u2019ll go over to the Tailscales\u2019 (the naga and dridder couple, and their son) place. Jane (the dridder) told me that she was once a nurse. She might be able to help, after all, as a dridder; her venom can paralyze people and put them to sleep.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell get moving! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to hold him off for long when he does lose control!\" the owner of the male voice said. \"Hell, I might have to run for Julia\u2019s room myself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, a flash of gray fur ran out the door and Janelle felt someone pick her up and carry her at a high speed and drop her off at an open doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet in lady,\u201d said the young male voice, as Janelle felt someone push her into the room. \u201cDon\u2019t come out until we tell you it is safe.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Janelle heard the door slam behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked around, Janelle saw that she was in a girl\u2019s room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she realized that, she looked down beside her and saw Julia, who was looking at her, with a puzzled look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Miss Janelle,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy are you naked?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Janelle looked at herself and saw that she was indeed naked. She had forgotten the clothes that were in the guestroom when John had told her to go and get help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Janelle\u2019s face to redden, deeply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere she was, in the house of a man, who had just saved her life, who had just fallen sick, locked in a room, with a young human, female, student of hers, naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cI was changing out of some dirty ripped ones when John told me that he was sick and that I needed to get help for him. Of course, something tells me that there isn\u2019t any in here that are my size.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least you had some nice clothes on when he first saw you,\u201d Julia said, as she opened up a drawer, searching for something. \u201cWhen I first saw him, I was wet, covered in saliva, with some stomach juice, cold, and completely naked. However, he found an art smock and some overalls for me to wear. Wasn\u2019t exactly comfortable, or pretty, but, well, I was dressed, somewhat. Ah, here they are.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Julia tossed a couple of small button looking things at Janelle, who caught them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShape-shifter clothes,\u201d said Julia. \u201cJohn gave me a set to wear in case these other clothes were no good. He even told me how to put them on. You place one device on your neck and you place the other on your waist. Once you do that, you\u2019ll be dressed, and it even changes to look like what you want it to look like.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Janelle did what Julia had told her, and found herself wearing what looked like a sweatshirt and pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d she said, sitting on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, however, the shirt and pants turned themselves into a really skimpy bra and a really thin thong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she exclaimed, covering herself with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I forgot. John told me that these things occasionally had a mind of their own at times, especially when they are new or are being worn by someone else for the first time,\u201d said Julia, with a giggle. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, they did that on me to, though I will say that I did look cute wearing a bunny outfit. Just think about some other type of clothes, like those you wore earlier today.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Janelle thought about the clothes she had been wearing, before they were torn by those monsters. She had been wearing a nice set of clothes, one that showed off her beautiful figure. This was, as she had been told, a part of the school\u2019s dress code, for female teachers. The school said that this was so that students would pay attention to them, for some reason. (Of course, while most students did, the reason was because they were looking at her body, and not necessarily keeping a real eye on the chalkboard, especially the older students, both males and females.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Janelle looked at the clothes again, they looked just like what she had wanted them to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch better,\u201d she said. (Also, for some reason, the clothes seemed to agree with her choice as they didn\u2019t bother playing tricks on her, like they normally would have when being worn by someone new.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked at Julia and asked, \u201cDo you know what\u2019s going on with John?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia shook her head and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure really. He told me he gets sick when he thinks about, or sees someone, eating someone\u2019s flesh. Was there someone eating someone else\u2019s flesh when he found you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Janelle said. \u201cBut he did kill some people who were planning on raping, killing, and eating me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that would explain the blood on his shirt,\u201d said Julia, also sitting down on the bed. \u201cHe probable feels guilty for killing them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would he feel guilt for killing monsters like those people were?\u201d Janelle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Julia smacked her on the back of the head, much as she had seen Tawna do to Justian at times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause, they were people,\u201d she said, as Janelle rubbed the back of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, why did you smack me?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou looked like you needed it,\u201d Julia said. \u201cBesides, you slapped John on the face during lunchtime.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Janelle gasped in shock, inwardly. The picture of John\u2019s face after that came to her. His eyes were full of pain, but not from physical pain. The pain those eyes had showed was an emotional type. It was as if the fact that she left the table was more painful than the fact that she had slapped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Janelle sighed unhappily. The poor guy had wanted nothing more than for her to just plainly sit next to him, and she slapped him for it, all because he had told her the things he had done to keep his students safe from the other teachers and each other, which was more than what most teachers did, including her own self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe must get lonely,\u201d she said, quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe does. He told me so,\u201d said Julia. \u201cHe told me that, other than the construction workers and the occasional salesman or priest, no one really comes to visit him, except for Mrs. Clawfoot. He told me it was because my aunt and uncle are always busy and no one else really cares about him as a person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as Janelle was about to ask Julia something, they heard a loud growl that shook the house and heard Justian shout, \u201cHOLYSHIT!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door quickly opened and closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting with his back to the door, as if trying to barricade it, Justian was breathing and panting heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s lost it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guy just grew and tried to take my head off with his claws.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a scream is heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops, guess I forgot about Samual,\u201d Justian said, with a weak, and nervous, smile, as well as a weak and nervous chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, someone started pounding on the door of the room saying, \u201cLetmein! Letmein! (Repeatedly)\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that\u2019s Samual,\u201d Julia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to let him in?\u201d Janelle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Justian said. \u201cThough it is about time for him to realize that he isn\u2019t all high and mighty as he thinks he is.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust open the damn door!\u201d Samual shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Justian suddenly opened the door, which caused Samual to fall into the room, just as a set of claws tried to grab him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that thing?\u201d he asked, angrily. \u201cAnd where is that vegetarian Wolfstone at?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustian just looked at him and said, with a bit of anger in his own eyes, as he shut the door, \u201cThat thing out there is Mr. Wolfstone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, that can\u2019t be. That thing is nothing more than a mindless beast with an apatite for blood and destruction,\u201d Samual said, looking at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the room started to shake, as if the place was being hammered by a thousand giants each with a sledgehammer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d Janelle asked, holding onto Julia in sheer terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I had to guess,\u201d Justian said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to enter the room so he can get to us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what\u2019s keeping it out?\u201d Samual asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Justian gave a smirk and pointed at Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is that human keeping that thing out?\u201d Samual asked, with compleat disbelife on his face, that a simple human was what was keeping the creature out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is simple really,\" Justian said, with a chuckle. \"As long as she is in here, anyone trying to enter this room, with the intent to cause her harm, will encounter a powerful barrier that will keep them out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would you know this?\u201d Samual asked, wondering how a common person would know what he, an elite, didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy stepbrother is a wizard, along with my stepfather,\" Justian said, as he looked out the window, in the aproximent direction of where he lived. \"He once took one of my trophies, from track, and took it to his room. When I tried to get into it, so I could beat him to a bloody pulp, a barrier sprang up, preventing me from entering it. Heck, anything that I had tried to do, in an attempt to get through, just failed miserably. In fact, the harder I tried to enter, the stronger the barrier seemed to become. If this barrier is similar to that, as long as Julia stays in this room, we should be safe.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, why must she be in the room?\u201d Samual asked, with anger that he had to stay in the same room as a bloodbag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is because she is what the barrier is protecting,\" Justian said, as he looked back at Samual. \"We are just lucky to be in here while she is. Otherwise, I, you, and that woman there would be dead now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Justian just sighed and sat down on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope Tawna gets here with help soon though,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my fault,\u201d Janelle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Samual looked at her and said, with anger and annoyance in his voice, \u201cWhy do you say that, human?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he hadn\u2019t saved my life, he wouldn\u2019t have killed those four men that were trying to kill me,\u201d she said, as she brought her knees to her chest, and wrapped her arms around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m about to die because he decided to interrupt someone\u2019s MEAL!?!?\" Samual shouted, as he looked at the woman. \"God, I really do hate that stupid, goddamned, Vegetarian!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSAMUAL, WOULD YOU PLEASE SHUT UP!\u201d shouted Justian. \u201cSit your ass down right now or I will kick you out of this room and let him eat you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Samual just looked at him, in a state of shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dare you order me around,\u201d he said, angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t want me to give you orders,\" Justain said, with a cold look in his eyes. \"Feel free to leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Justian opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding outside of a yellowish transparent wall-like structure was John, at one hundred feet in height and in his werewolf form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was clawing and biting at the barrier, with a primal animalistic look in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Samual just sat down on the floor and said, \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Justian said, as he shut the door. \u201cAt least we now know why he\u2019s a vegetarian. If he get\u2019s like this when he just kills someone, imagine what he\u2019d be like if he did eat somebody.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Samual perked his head up and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep him here!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy Samual?\u201d Justian asked, a little curious. \u201cI thought that you would want him to leave.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do,\u201d said Samual. \u201cBut if he goes into the city, even if I don\u2019t care if he killed everyone there, including my family, because I\u2019d get my inheritance sooner, the damage he\u2019d cause would be tremendous.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you\u2019d want him to stay here, so that the city is not damaged,\u201d said Justian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamual then nodded at this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just be sure he will not suffocate.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right James,\u201d said another voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of a struggle are heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClara, help them out with holding him down and keeping his mouth shut,\u201d shouted the first voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what about you honey?\" a female voice asked. \"You can\u2019t stand up without my help.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey need your help more than I do now,\" the man said. \"Please, for Julia\u2019s sake?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes dear,\" said the female voice. \"Hold onto him for me, Mrs. Tailscale.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem,\" said a second female voice. \"I\u2019ll cocoon him up and stick him someplace safe.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more sounds of struggling are heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Jane,\" said the first male voice. \"Now bite a vein in his neck and inject him with your paralysis venom.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muffled sounds of something howling in pain are heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\" the male voice said. \"As soon as he stops thrashing, let go of him and I\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, the sounds of struggle have all but cease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that will do,\" the male voice said. \"Release him. Clara, some assistance please, I need to be able to move my arms for this spell.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the voice says, in an apologetic tone, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for this John.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a wolf\u2019s howl of pain is heard, and then there is silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like an eternity, there is a knocking at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys alright in there?\u201da third female voice asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s Tawna'v voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d Justian shouts. \u201cAll four of us are okay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\" Tawna said. \"Well John caused a good deal of damage to the place trying to get in the room, so you will have to stay put until Jane has finished making a net for you to jump onto. The Highmen\u2019s (the giant couple) are trying to keep the floor holding you guys from collapsing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\" Justian said. \"Just ask her to try and hurry up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the group jumps onto a large spider web and the room crashes down into what was left of the basement, taking a wall and support beam with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was close,\u201d said the female giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, my strength just gave out just after they jumped,\u201d the male giant said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d have to say that we were all very lucky,\u201d said a man with a black full body cast on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia looked at him and said, \u201cUncle James! Aunt Clara! You came to save us! How did you know we needed help?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, James shook his head and said, \u201cLike I\u2019d leave you unprotected. I lost you once, so I put a small spell on you when I first hugged you. It warns me if you are ever in danger, and there is no one that can help you effectively. Also, it is undetectable, unless one is looking for it, and even then, that wizard, witch, or whatever would have to, practically, be holding you to detect it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustian then looked around for John, and found the man, still in his giant werewolf form, on the ground, on the other side of the house\u2019s foundations, snoring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you guys do to him?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked at him and said, \u201cWell boy, the Highmans here tackled him to the ground. As I know from playing football, the smallest guy can take out the biggest man on the other team, if he takes out the guy\u2019s knees. They held him down while Jack (the naga) kept his mouth shut, so he couldn\u2019t bite anyone. Of course, that wasn\u2019t enough, so Clara basically encased him in a full body cast, which is something she is very good at doing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, thank you honey,\" a female voice, coming the collor of the body cast, said. \"Remind me to have some, really good fun with you, when we get home.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, James gave a light chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, anyways,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhile he was barely capable of moving, Jane here bit him with her paralyzing venom, so he couldn\u2019t move. After that got spread throughout his body, I did the rest. Basically, I put him to sleep, though when he wakes up in a few hours, he will have one hell of a headache. Then again, the headache is because of second spell I casted on him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does the other spell do?\u201d Janelle asked, causing everyone to look at her, noticing her for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy my dear,\u201d said James. \u201cIt\u2019s so that he can control himself when he is in his fully combined form. I kind of knew he was afraid of this form, cause he would never really used it, for a very good reason. It is because he loses control far more easily than if he was just a giant or a werewolf even.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by control?\u201d Janelle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, a human like hand was placed on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Janelle saw the owner, she freaked out a little, as the owner was the dridder the one student had talked about, and she had a fear of dridders, as she had had a bad experience with them when she was younger, as she had barely gotten out of the web of one, when she\u2019d gotten caught in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, for some reason, Janelle saw that Julia was smiling at her, friendly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mrs. Tailscale,\u201d she said. \u201cHow\u2019s Little Jack (the human boy that is the son of the naga and dridder) doing?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh he\u2019s doing just fine, though he was nervous when he saw that John was destroying the place you guys live in,\u201d said the dridder, as if she was just talking to another dridder, and not someone who could easily become a meal for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dridder then looked at Janelle and said, \u201cWhat James means by control is John\u2019s ability to control his self, when the urge hits him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I hate to ask,\" Janelle said. \"But what do you mean by urge?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the dridder leaned down and whispered into her ear, \u201cEither the urge to just rape someone, or eat someone, or even, both.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Janelle\u2019s eyes bulged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying that John would have eaten, or, even, raped, me if I wasn\u2019t in that room?\u201d she whispered, so Julia couldn\u2019t hear her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dridder raised her head and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose are the most basic of urges that anyone could have,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter all, all animals need to eat to survive, and reproduce so the species itself can survive.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dridder then gently grabbed a hold of her, lifted her off of the web, and took her to the ground, and went back to get the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dridder went to help the others out, Janelle walked over to John\u2019s sleeping form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you just meet him today?\u201d said a male voice, as a hand placed itself on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was scaled and reptilian in appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle, acting on fear and instinct, grabbed it, and twisted it, in an attempt to break the owner\u2019s arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, that won\u2019t work too well on someone like me,\u201d the voice said, with a light-hearted chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle looked at the owner of the hand and arm and saw that the person was a naga. From where the waist would be was the long tail of a snake. Above that was human in build, but covered in scales, and the man\u2019s head resembled that of a snake. However, despite the fact that the man could easily swallow her, much in the same way that a snake would, he was just talking to her, as if she was another naga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone, who was a reptile in nature, attacked you at some point in the past.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, when I was walking home from work today. I don\u2019t even want to think about what would have happened if John hadn\u2019t shown up and killed him and his friends,\u201d Janelle said, looking back at John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I\u2019ve seen the end result of things like that,\u201d the naga said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Janelle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI used to be a police officer back in my hometown,\u201d said the naga. \u201cSomething like that would always occur on what seemed to be a daily basis. However, no one did a thing about it, except me. It started one year after I had married Jane, and a month after I was accepted on the force. It happened one night, while I was on patrol, when I saw a dragon, with a full belly, lift a small bundle of cloth to his mouth and swallow it.  If it hadn\u2019t been moving before hand, I would have ignored it, but it had been. Something in me said to stop and get the bundle out of the man. When I told him to cough the bundle up, the guy refused and said for me to get my own baby. At that, something else in me exploded. It was something of a paternal nature. You see, Jane and I had been trying to have a child, but when we went to the doctor, he said that she was sterile. When we went to adopt, the orphanage said that we had to have been married for at least five years to be considered eligible. Well, on that night, I felt that it was a father\u2019s duty, not a police officer\u2019s, to try and save that baby, so I attacked and killed him. When I opened him up, I found the body of a dead human woman, who seemed to have given birth recently. Her body just reeked of recently having just been raped. She seemed to have died from drowning in the guy\u2019s stomach acids, before I could have saved her. The bundle of cloth though was intact. It had landed on the body of the woman. When I removed some of the cloth, I saw a baby boy. Well, I took it home, where Jane through a fit. She said that just because she couldn\u2019t have a child, it didn\u2019t mean I should deprive a mother of a child that was rightfully her own. She also said that if I planned on eating it to get out of the house and never come back. Of course, when I explained the situation to her, she calmed down. When she saw the child look at her, she just couldn\u2019t put him down, not even for a second. It was basically then that we came to an agreement, that we could never take another human as a meal. Then again, even before we had known that Jane was sterile, the humans that we ate were usually older than thirty, and mostly criminals that I had captured, people like rapists and murderers. However, the moment me and Jane saw little Jack, as we soon called him, we knew that we could never take another human as a meal, if only for his sake, and peace of mind.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened after that?\u201d Janelle asked, still wonering why someone would care for a child that wasn't even one of their own, or even that of their spouse's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at first,\" the naga said. \"We tried to keep him a secret. Me and Jane would, more or less, kidnap lactating women, who had too much milk to feed just their own babies, or had lost theirs, for any variety of reasons, and force them to breastfeed little Jack, until he was full. If they had no children, or family, of their own, well, we\u2019d keep them around for a week or two. In any case, after each time the woman feed Jack, Jane would inject them with a type of venom that caused amnesia, so that the woman wouldn\u2019t remember seeing Jack. We would keep them in the same room, stuck to a web Jane had made in it. Even when the other women saw one of us taking one of them, they were unable to figure out what we did with them, except take some of the milk out of them, for some reason. When we no longer needed those that were mothers or one that we kept for a longer time was unable to produce milk, we would blindfold that woman and take her near where we had taken her. Thankfully, after a year or so, Jack no longer needed breast milk, so not having to take care of those women was a relief for us, in many ways. Of course, then there was the problem with education. We wanted Jack to have the best education, but there would be no chance of him going to school without a birth certificate. As a result, I, um, convinced an excellent forger, who was also a doctor, to make one, with me and Jane as Jack\u2019s biological parents. Of course, knowing that the school\u2019s headmaster was cheating with the Police Chief\u2019s wife was a plus, in getting them to accept Jack into that school. We also made sure that nothing bad happened to him, cause I\u2019d expose the headmaster\u2019s dirty little secret.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, does your son know the truth about himself?\u201d Janelle asked, as she saw Julia rush up to a similarly aged human boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he knows he\u2019s different,\" the naga said, as he looked at the boy, with a fondness in his eyes. \"When he asks why he doesn\u2019t look anything like me or his mother, we tell him it is because he is special, that somewhere out there, someone has a great plan for him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what about your relatives, or your in-laws?\" Janelle asked. \"What do you tell them?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is an easy explanation for that,\" the naga said, with a sly smile. \"One of each of our parents was human, so we just say it was chance that he was born human, and not a naga/dridder mix. The again, enough of his features are similar to my, and Jane\u2019s, human parent, that everyone buys it, including him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, he has no idea that his real mother is dead, or knows anything about his father?\u201d Janelle asked, as she looked at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I knew the kid\u2019s real father, if only briefly,\u201d the naga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Janelle asked, wondering what the naga meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuy was a murderer, and a rapist. Caught him about seven months before I saved little Jack from that dragon\u2019s stomach. You can kind of see where I\u2019m going with this,\u201d the naga said, with something of a nervous chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I can see,\" Janelle said, knowing that the man had practically admited to killing the boy's father. \"You and your wife hadn\u2019t made your agreement, so he was one of your meals.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, even then, we were on our way to becoming vegetarians,\" the naga said, as he looked back at the boy. \"We wouldn\u2019t just take someone off of the streets for a meal, we wanted a good enough reason to justify, to ourselves, the act of killing someone so we were able to eat them. It\u2019s been almost twelve years since me, and Jane, have eaten a human, even for self-defense. John though, he\u2019s told me that he has eaten humans, but he won\u2019t do it unless he has to, either for self-defense, or the defense of someone he cares about, or if he was starving to death, and there was absolutely no other choice.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did tell me that he did once eat a piece of a human as part of a meal,\u201d Janelle said, as she looked at the giant sleeping werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\" the naga said, as he shook his head. \"But he also probably said that he felt pain for what he had done.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by pain?\u201d Janelle asked, as she looked back at the naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImagine just killing someone, who had none nothing wrong, not even to you, who happened to be just going about his day, when you killed him just to satisfy an urge that you had,\" the naga said, with a sigh. \"The moment that you came to grips with what you had done, you would feel guilty. You would do anything to get rid of it, try to deign it, put it on someone, or something else, or even try to kill yourself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what about John?\" Janelle asked. \"Why would he feel guilty about killing those monsters that were going to kill me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere could be a couple of reasons,\" the man said, as he looked at his stepson. \"He could just hate having to kill anyone, or, much like he told me that there is a part of him that enjoys eating human flesh, there could be a part of him that likes to kill.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would be correct on both parts, Jack,\u201d said a deep voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was John. He had woken up long before James had said he would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch, that\u2019s a major headache for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone got some sort of big-ass painkillers on them; my body hurts like a ton of cities hit me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, we all did a number on you John,\u201d said James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then said, \u201cWell, someone must have paralyzed me after I lost control, because I can\u2019t seem to be able to move any part of my body, except certain parts of my head.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was me,\u201d said Jane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have to thank you for that. Otherwise, I doubt anything could have stopped me,\u201d said John, with a slight smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Janelle asked, \u201cJohn, why did you say Jack was correct? Do you hate having to kill, or is there a part of you that likes to kill?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn tried to move his head, so he could look at her more clearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s both,\u201d he said, causing everyone to gasp. \u201cI hate having to kill, but at the same time, I love the excitement that I feel during the act, watching the life drain from someone\u2019s eyes, the feeling of power over one\u2019s fate, being able to decide if that person should live or die.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said this, John\u2019s face became very menacing in appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever,\u201d he said, sighing, as his face returning to normal. \u201cThat is not the sort of person I want to become. I don\u2019t want people to fear me because of what I can do to harm them. I want to be the person that parents tell their children, \u2018That\u2019s the man you should look up to,\u2019 or, \u2018Son, here is a man that is an inspiration to the entire world,\u2019 and other such things. After all, when I die, I want to be able to walk through those pearly gates, with my head held high, knowing that I had helped a lot of people out with their problems.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John gave a smile of genuine happiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Samual, who just had to ruin the moment, said, \u201cSo you tried to kill me just because you can\u2019t stand the sight of a little bit of blood? How pitiful can you get, vegetarian?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, everyone glared at him, including the Highmans, and John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d he thought, as the world became very black to him, because he had fainted. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several hours later, John was sitting in his field, as the venom had worn off, in his human form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is a setback,\u201d he thought. \u201cOf all of the things I could have destroyed, I destroyed my own house and home. Thankfully Julia and the others were alright.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least the insurance was paid up,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to pay the construction crews a little extra to get it fixed up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, John heard a twig snap behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit,\u201d he thought, quickly turning around and standing up, with his claws extended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been the first time a bear or some such thing had tried to sneak up upon him while he was sitting there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, instead of a bear, like he had been expecting, it was Janelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJanelle,\u201d he said, retracting his claws. \u201cWhat are you doing out here? It\u2019s not safe for a human to be out here this late in the day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to know where you were,\u201d she said, walking up to him. \u201cJustian told me where you might be and walked with me here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least he was smart enough to not let you walk here alone,\u201d John said, wrapping his arms around her. \u201cOtherwise, something would have eaten you for its dinner, and I don\u2019t mean a person who was capable about thinking about their actions, like those guys back in town were.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, um, about that, I don\u2019t know how I can thank you for that,\u201d Janelle said, as John took her to his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d John said, rubbing the back of his head, \u201cI think sitting next to me in the cafeteria might be a step in the right direction.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what about everyone else? Wouldn\u2019t they be suspicious if I did sit next to you during lunch?\u201d Janelle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet them be suspicious,\u201d John said, with a slight smile. \u201cIf they think you can somehow tame the might Mr. Wolfstone, it will only increase your reputation.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, but still-\u201d It was at this moment, that John tried to kiss Janelle\u2019s cheek, but he got her lips instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, sorry,\u201d he said, a blush developing on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s just been a while since a woman has sat next to me this close, for any real length of time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething tells me that the kiss wasn\u2019t meant for my lips,\u201d Janelle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t at all,\" John said, with a nervous smile. \"Father always said, \u2018Don\u2019t kiss her on the lips until the second, or third, date.\u2019 Then again, mother was a giant so they kind of had to work out how she would be able to kiss him safely, so that he wouldn\u2019t get stuck on her lips, especially on their first kiss.\u201d Then he gave a bit of a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sounds like your father was a very smart man,\u201d Janelle said, as she put a hand on the man's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he had to be,\" John said, with a chuckle. \"Especially since the love of his life was easily ten times his size, at the least, because father was eight foot when he was in his werewolf form, and six foot when in his human form.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can you tell me about them?\u201d Janelle asked, wonering what sort of people could produce a man like John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\" John said, with a smile. \"If my father\u2019s heart was the size of my mother, there was nothing to compare to the size of my mother\u2019s. They were the gentlest souls this side of the pearly gates. They may not have been as strict about being vegetarians as I am, but they would never eat someone that had their entire life ahead of them. I mean, if they had to choose between eating rotting deer meat, or a child, whose body was pure, with nothing unnatural in it, they would eat the rotting deer meat and raise the child as if it was their own.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, they would always adopt?\u201d Janelle said, in a questioning manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\" John said, as he looked back at his memories. \"It was only by chance, or a miracle, that my mother got pregnant with me. All I can guess is that father somehow got far enough up in her, either with her pushing him, or somehow climbing his way up, or both, that his sperm were able to hit their mark on one of my mother\u2019s eggs, and nine months later, \u2018Congratulations, it\u2019s a boy.\u2019 Of course, that\u2019s only a guess. To be honest, I don\u2019t think my parents really cared on the how, or the why, just that they now had a child of their own flesh and blood, though that didn\u2019t stop them from taking care of other children.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Janelle said, \u201cJohn, not to get to personal or anything, but how long has it been since you were close to a woman?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mean, as a romantic interest, or had sex with one?\u201d John asked, as a few memories came back to his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, how about, you tell me about it, on both parts.\u201d Janelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince high school at least, for both,\" John said, with a sigh. \"Even if my classmates had no problems with forcing others to have sex with them, I had been raised not to do that to anyone. I would only do it if the other person wanted to do it with me, and even then, if she changed her mind, I would respect it. As for romantic interests, my last girlfriend went to a different collage than I did, one that doesn\u2019t share the same rules mine did. Well, let\u2019s just say that someone enjoyed her for more than just sex and let\u2019s leave it at that, okay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand,\" Janelle said, as she saw a tear in his eyes. \"Though it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone not having sex, or a romantic interest, for over a year, let alone ten.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstandability aside,\"John said, as he looked up at the sky, and looked over at his left shoulder, which had a tattoo of a heart, with the head of a wolf kissing the head of a girl with a red hood, on it. \"She had been the one I had wanted to spend the rest of my life with. Hell, I never even found out who ate her, so I could show them how I felt about it. I even bribed a teacher of mine to try and find out about it, under the pretences that he had had a personal interest in her. That school told him, \u2018Sorry, but we can not confirm or deign if that person is or was a student here.\u2019 As for her parent\u2019s, all they said was that it was against school policy to reveal who had done the deed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe had sent me a letter, the day before her parents received the news, that she\u2019d been some student\u2019s supper,\u201d he said. \u201cIn it, she told me that she\u2019d been seeing someone who reminded her of me. She told me not to worry, because as much as she liked this person, it was me that she was in love with, that she wanted to marry me when we had graduated from our respective collages, or in my case, university. I was so happy when she said that, that I started to write a reply the next day, when her parents sent me a letter the next morning, of the next day, as it took me a while to really get a good angle on the letter, and they told me what they had been told, that their baby girl was digesting in someone\u2019s stomach. It broke my heart, and left me depressed. My grades plummeted, my attendance rate dropped to virtually zero in my classes, and I even contemplated committing suicide. In fact, I was standing right on the edge of a cliff, getting ready to jump, when I had an epiphany. It was at that moment that I decided to become a teacher, and teach others about what I had gone through, so that they wouldn\u2019t. When I graduated, I came here, as it was where I was born and raised. It was here that I would start a revolutionary way of thinking, I had thought, and still do. Even if it is only because of someone\u2019s greed, like some politician, I want laws to be passed, preventing people from eating others, at the very least. Of course, if there was no way to completely stop people from truly eating others, I would put the minimum age at, at least, thirty years old, at the very least, before someone could eat that person. At least, that way, the guy would have had a chance to have had at least a couple of children to carry on the family name. However, if people in accounting really did any amount of thinking, they would realize that, economically, it would make financial sense to prevent people from eating others. For instance, let\u2019s say that there is a school, that costs one hundred dollars a month, minimal, to maintain itself. If there are one hundred people paying for it, each of them would only have to pay a dollar a month, minimal. However, if all, but one of them, are eaten, that one person now has to pay the full one hundred dollars a month, each month. If he, and the others, hadn\u2019t eaten any of the other people, the guy would only have had to pay twelve dollars each year. Now, the poor guy is stuck paying one thousand two hundred dollars each and every single year.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you would want to use peoples\u2019 greed, to protect others?\u201d Janelle asked, as she looked into John's soft brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what it came down to, yes, I would,\" he said. \"However, by the time those tax laws were considered to be outdated, or something, people should be so used to be considering others as people, that they would call the eating of another, for non-survival reasons, what it truly is, murder.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, why would you want all that to happen?\u201d Janelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John looked at Janelle, placed his arms around her, held her close to him, and said, \u201cSo that a person like you will never need the aid of a monster like me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he placed his head on her shoulder and started to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see those men,\u201d he said. \u201cI can see how they died, in absolute pain and agony. Even if they were planning to rape, kill and eat you, I feel guilty for killing them. It doesn\u2019t matter if I just kill someone, or actually eat them; the pain and guilt are the same. If things were different, or if they had just listened to reason, and did what I had asked them to, I wouldn\u2019t have killed them, not even Twotail, although the bastard had it coming to him anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean that he had it coming?\u201d Janelle asked, as the large man cried on her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bastard raped Julia the night before I had rescued her,\" John said. \"The monster had ordered her to basically suck his penis, until he had ejaculated into her mouth, for a long time, from what Julia told me, or at least it must have felt like it to her at any rate. I mean, what sort of person does that to a child? Only a monster would even think of such a thing, and only a real monster would actually carry it out. I mean, if I was out of control, I would either just straight up rape you, in a way that there was a chance that you\u2019d become pregnant, and have my child, or just plainly eat you, or maybe, that there would be a small chance that I would do both, if my other side thought you\u2019d be a bad choice as a mate to bare my child, after the fact. After all, those things would be because I\u2019d be acting on instinct, and not conscious choice.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then began to cry even harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle then stroked his cheek and said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright John. You did what you had to do to protect me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I only killed the first three for you, and the one was trying to run away,\u201d he said. \u201cI killed the kitsune, Twotail, for Julia. The scavengers only finished him off, but he was dead the moment I found out that he had raped Julia. To be honest, I think he was just lucky I just pulled his limbs off and left him for the scavengers to deal with.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Janelle asked, wondering what John had been planning on doing instead of what he had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had been planning to do something far worse to him,\" John said, with a sigh. \"Something that, I probably would have regretted afterwards, even more than just killing him. To be honest, the guy had asked me, for the sake of his wife and son, to not kill him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did that, just for Julia?\u201d Janelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I care about her,\" John said. \"She helps to fill a hole I have, in my heart.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I might just be able to help you out as well,\u201d Janelle said, with a sly smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then started to ask how, but it was at this moment that Janelle purposely planted a kiss on John\u2019s lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father may have told you to wait until the second date,\u201d she said. \u201cBut mine never did.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then kissed him again, which John gladly accepted, and returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, John felt like going further, so he asked if she wanted to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle smiled and said, \u201cSure, but you realize it is a little chilly out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that,\u201d John said, with a smile. \u201cBut, if I know my clothes, we both have shape-shifting ones on. Basically, yours can merge with mine, so the two of us can stay warm, still do it, and have some element of privacy. Besides, I am part werewolf you know, so if I shift to that form, my fur would keep you warm, even if we were both naked.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case, John, be my guest,\" Janelle said, with a smile. \"I\u2019ve never had sex with a werewolf you should know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John smiled, shifted into his werewolf form, gently grabbed Janelle, and placed her on top of him. He then pressed a button on each of their clothes, so they could merge together. Then, the two got to pleasuring each other, throughout the night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She put a control spell on you?\u201d asked a wizard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 wish\u2026 wizard. I\u2026 can\u2026 still\u2026 kick\u2026 your\u2026 ass,\u201d said the zombie, as he got up out of his seat, slightly slower than a normal human would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnock it off you two,\u201d said a three headed hydra. \u201cYou saw what happened yesterday. Even if that new human teacher could get away with hitting him, I doubt that Mr. Wolfstone would be happy to catch you two fighting the moment he comes in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door opens, and Mr. Wolfstone comes in, half-heartedly tossing Tawna and Justian at their seats, with Julia following close behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning class,\u201d he said, with a chipper sound in his voice, more so than normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Mr. Wolfstone, are you, alright?\u201d asked a student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am,\u201d said Mr. Wolfstone. \u201cI had the best night I\u2019ve had in a long time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the class just looked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cEven fearsome teachers like me deserve to have themselves a good night, once in a while anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another student asked, \u201cUm, Mr. Wolfstone, where is Samual at?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s helping a friend of mine test an invulnerability potion out,\" Mr. Wolfstone said, with a wicked chuckle. \"The kid had the nerve to call him a two-bit illusionist that couldn\u2019t even pull a rabbit out of his hat. Needless to say, my friend didn\u2019t take too kindly to that. Also, a couple of giant friends of mine wanted something to help enhance their, personal, pleasures. At the moment, he is probably in a moist, dark, cave, with a very thick shaft blocking his escape. Of course, those of you who have taken Sexual Education class, or been a part of it, can figure out what it is I am talking about.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, there is a mixture of low \u201cLucky bastard,\u201ds and \u201cOoh, I wouldn\u2019t want to be him,\u201ds being whispered around by the majority of the older students in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d Mr. Wolfstone said. \u201cIf there are no more questions about why I am in such a good mood, or about where Samual is, I have an important lecture for you, one that is not in the book at all.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cToday,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to talk about what makes something a person, or an animal. Now, who can name some possible differences? Anyone have any ideas?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, people are intelligent compared to animals,\u201d said one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good possibility,\" Mr. Wolfstone said. \"But I\u2019ve known of people who couldn\u2019t tie a simple overhand knot, despite the fact that they were physically capable of it, and I\u2019ve known of wild predators coming up with amazing attack strategies, and those that were their prey came up with very effective defensive tactics. Will the next person speak?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm people can speak and animals can\u2019t,\u201d said another student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrawk, parrots can speak,\u201d Mr. Wolfstone said, in a parrot sounding voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he made a few movements with his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the class looked at each other in confusion, he said, \u201cFor those of you who can\u2019t understand Sign Language, I said, \u2018and there are people who are unable to speak a word.\u2019 Now, does anyone else have an idea about what is the difference between animals and people?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Justian raised his hand, slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJustian, do you have an idea?\u201d Mr. Wolfstone asked, with a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, people can think about what they have done in the past and try to improve themselves?\u201d Justian said, in a questioning manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Mr. Wolfstone, who had been walking around, slapped his hand on Justian\u2019s desk, waking everyone up, and said, \u201cNow we are getting somewhere. People are capable of thinking of their past deeds so that they can improve themselves. Admittedly animals will work on improving themselves on things, like being better hunters. However, people can realize what is wrong with them selves and try to get help in fixing the problem. Of course, this is not the answer to the question I asked, but it is very close to it. Can someone improve on his idea?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Tawna raised her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTawna,\" said the man. \"Would you care to elaborate Justian\u2019s idea?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\" the dog-like werewolf said, in a confident manner. \"I think that while both people and animals have instincts, people are capable of controlling them, and not necessarily acting upon them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Mr. Wolfstone snapped his fingers, pointed at Tawna, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for! For instance, if a male dog detects a female one in heat, he will rush over to her so he can mate with her. A man and a woman can decide to either do it at another time, or locate a better and more private spot. Also, an animal will usually eat the food that is given to them. A person on the other hand can say, \u2018I\u2019m not in the mood for that,\u2019 or, \u2018That\u2019s not very good for me now,\u2019 or even, \u2018I can\u2019t eat that, not anymore.\u2019 Animals act on urges when they do things. People though can control them, and not necessarily act on them. Now, let\u2019s perform an experiment. Did any of you not have breakfast?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, a stomach growls from the back of the class. It is coming from an eighteen year old, male, crocodile-like person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Daniel Leathertail, I guess breakfast ran a little fast on you this morning,\u201d John said, with a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it didn\u2019t,\" the young man said. \"Something distracted me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John smiled, broadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess,\u201d he said. \u201cA huge werewolf started chasing you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, how did you know?\u201d the crocodile-like person asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple really,\" John said, as he looked at him. \"I know a twelve year old human boy, a couple of fifty foot tall giants, and someone who hates it when people call him a two-bit illusionist.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, you set me up,\u201d Daniel said, angrily, as he stood up from his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve told you, and your father, to stop trespassing on my property to try and hunt those working on construction on my land. Next time, I won\u2019t have my friend stop at the edge of my property. Next time, I\u2019ll let him catch and eat both of you,\u201d said Mr. Wolfstone, with a deep growl in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s conduct the experiment,\" he said. \"I will have someone sit in a chair, tied up, at the front of the room. You will stand in the back, with a clear area between you and the person in the chair. The challenge is this: Can you control your hunger, or will it control you? Know this, depending on what happens, you will either cause the rest of the class to fail or pass this year. So here\u2019s the deal, if you control your hunger until class is over, everyone in here will pass, but, while I will allow you to grab the person, and maybe take their clothes off, if so much as a drop of saliva lands on, or touches the person, the entire class will fail, and it will be because you couldn\u2019t control yourself. So Daniel, do you want to take a challenge that I face daily, for the rest of the class period, or will you refuse, and just cause yourself to take the class next year, which would be embarrassing considering that you are in the twelfth grade and you probable have collages dueling it out for you to go to them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, everyone looked at Daniel, some telling him to go for it, and others pleading with him to not, and a few telling him to not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he just grinned and said, \u201cYou\u2019re on, teach. This will be as easy as eating a human meat pie.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, poor choice of words, Mr. Leathertail,\u201d said Mr. Wolfstone. \u201cFor the person that will be tied up in the chair will be human, and I know it is human flesh you seemed to be particularly fond of, if I recall correctly.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John walked up to Julia\u2019s desk, and kneeled down to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you want me to do this Mr. John?\u201d she asked, nervously. \u201cThe idea of being tied up scares me, especially after what happened to me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know child,\u201d said John. \u201cBut sometimes, we must confront our fears, so we can deal with them. For a long time, I was afraid of what would happen if I lost control of myself. Now, I know what will happen, cause I have friends that will take care of me, if or when it happens again. If you think you can\u2019t do this, you better let me know now, cause once this starts, I cannot interfere on your behalf, no matter how much I\u2019ll want to, because, I won\u2019t be in the room. Basically, I\u2019m going to be locked out, so there will be nothing stopping Daniel from doing whatever he wants to you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Julia looked behind her and looked at Daniel. He was easily as tall as John in his werewolf form, and he had a wicked grin on his face as he looked hungrily at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis look scared Julia, as it looked like that of the kitsune that did that thing he did to her. She then looked at John and saw that he was slightly nervous himself, as there was a little bit of a scared look in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but know this, no one, except Daniel, will be allowed to stop Daniel,\u201d John said, as he gave her a light kiss on her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re braver than I was, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he stood up and said, \u201cCome on Julia, let\u2019s get you tied up.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When John was done tying Julia up, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be out of the room during this experiment.  What this means is this, Daniel\u2019s fear of me won\u2019t be a factor, because I will be unable to do anything. Also, no one, and I mean absolutely no one, will be allowed to do anything to prevent Daniel from doing whatever he wants to do, not even if he does mange to actually eat her. However Daniel, know this, either a bunch of people could up admiring you for your control of your urges, or, well, you could end up very dead somehow, somewhere.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John left the room and headed down to the teachers\u2019 lounge, which also doubled as the principal\u2019s office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered the room, John heard a deep voice say, \u201cWhy, hello John. I didn\u2019t expect you in here this early in the morning.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that Jeff,\u201d John said. \u201cI\u2019m currently conducting an experiment in my classroom.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little difficult to conduct something if you are not there to conduct it,\u201d Jeff said, looking down from his oversized desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said John. \u201cBut the point of the experiment is to see how well the students can control themselves.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you want to see if they will follow that rule of yours when you are not there,\u201d the T-rex creature said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the basics of it,\" John said, with a slight sigh. \"Also it\u2019s a high risk experiment.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow high risk is it?\u201d the principal asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone either passes the class, or everyone fails,\" John said. \"It all hinges on one student\u2019s ability to control his hunger.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds interesting,\u201d said Jeff. \u201cLet me put it up on my main monitor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jeff put the number for the camera in John\u2019s room into the computer, John looked at the smaller monitors, as the school had cameras everywhere, (including a few places where they shouldn\u2019t be). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Jeff,\u201d said John. \u201cI don\u2019t think parents would like it if they knew we had cameras in the bathroom.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how am I supposed to know what they are doing in there if we didn\u2019t?\u201d Jeff asked, a slight blush developing on his face. \u201cWell, just don\u2019t let your wife catch you watching them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, she\u2019d enjoy them,\" the man said. \"It\u2019s our daughter that would throw a fit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou happen to be a father?\u201d John asked, suspiciously, because Jeff had never said anything about being a father in all the years he had known him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, been one for the last twenty-five years,\" Jeff said with a smile, as he looked back at the computer. \"Then again, my wife (a dragon) and I were expecting something reptilian. Imagine our surprise when the kid was born human. Ah, but she was so beautiful, we named her after my mother, Janelle.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John, who had been drinking some coffee, did a spit-take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, the coffee was a little hot. Uh, what did you say her name was?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJanelle, Janelle Abigail Snapjaw,\u201d said Jeff with a smile. \u201cDo you want to see a picture of her?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, sure,\" John said. \"I\u2019ll take a look.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen John saw the picture, his eyes bulged. It was the same Janelle he met, got slapped by, saved, nearly killed, or raped, and had had sex with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Shit,\u201d he thought. \u201cI had sex with my boss\u2019s daughter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it you met her,\u201d Jeff said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d said John. \u201cShe spent the night at my place, especially given what nearly happened to her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Jeff. \u201cWhat almost happened?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that some scavengers had a free meal, when I was done with the guys who tried to attack her,\u201d John said, with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid they rape my Janelle?\u201d Jeff asked, with some anger in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll assure you,\" John said. \"No one raped her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s good,\u201d Jeff said, as he calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough I should warn you,\" John said, with a nervous chuckle. \"She and I, well, let\u2019s just say that she gave me permission.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and she had sex!?!\u201d Jeff shouted, slamming the desk and standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes we did, father,\u201d said Janelle, as she walked in. \u201cAnd before you get all worked up over it, I did start it, and he was a gentleman about it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, how long have you been there?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLong enough to hear that there are cameras in the bathrooms,\u201d she said, looking at Jeff, with a bit of annoyance in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Janelle looked at John and asked, \u201cJohn, what are you doing out of your classroom? I saw you walking past the door of my room and I know that your class is nowhere near there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, do you remember what we talked about last night?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\" Janelle said. \"It was about ways and reasons for people to not eat others.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have a test going on about it,\u201d John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, before I started the experiment, I had a discussion with the class about what makes something an animal or a person, that people could control their urges while animals were ruled by them,\u201d John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what does that have to do with anything?\u201d Janelle asked, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jeff said, \u201cJohn, you might want to see this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\" Jeff said. \"I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. One of your students, the one that\u2019s standing in the back, just punched a hole in the wall and stuck his arm through it, as if to keep himself from moving or something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess,\" John said. \"Scared look on his face, so scared he fears for his life if he does something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\" Jeff said, his eyes wide open. \"That\u2019s what the face looks like.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow is when it really starts,\u201d John said, with a mild amount of worry and nervousness in his face. \u201cThe question now is this, can Daniel keep his hunger in check until class is over.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Janelle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeff, would you show your daughter the picture?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do you one better,\u201d said Jeff, pressing a button that caused a screen to come down. \u201cNow, I need to figure out how to turn this thing on. The guy forgot to tell me how before I ate him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused John to look at Jeff in annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the guy was taking too long, and the price, ridiculous,\u201d said Jeff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better let me do it father,\u201d Janelle said. \u201cI remember the time you blew the fuse box during Christmas, ten years ago.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jeff gave a slightly embarrassed chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault that the outlets couldn\u2019t take the Christmas lights,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\" Janelle said, as she looked at her father. \"But it should have been obvious that you shouldn\u2019t put a thousand strings into a dozen outlets.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John broke out in laughter. \u201cAnd here I never took you for one that liked to enjoy the holidays,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Janelle got the monitor and screen synchronized, she gasped, as she went to stand next to John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is Julia tied up to that chair in the front of the room?\u201d she asked, looking at John. \u201cI thought that you cared for her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John sat down and said, \u201cI do. That\u2019s why I\u2019m worried. However, this has been what I\u2019ve been trying to get to for the last five years. For the last five years I\u2019ve been keeping students who took my class safe from both faculty and each other. The question for me has been what will keep faculty and students from preying on other students if I\u2019m not here to try and keep them in line. Therefore, I figured, that the best way would be, give them a reason not to, whether it be financial or personal, or something else entirely. Well, while I haven\u2019t come up with a reason to convince teachers to not prey upon the students, I have found one for the students themselves.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and what would that be,\u201d Jeff asked, with a bit of interest in this subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he didn\u2019t entirely like John, especially after his own personal encounters with him when he was younger, and especially now, since John had just admitted to having sex with his daughter, he had noticed that when John was a student, and now a teacher, at the school, the school\u2019s finances had been, and were currently, in the black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen John had gone away to Harmony University, the school fell into debt and had been very close to shutting down, when Jeff, grudgingly, hired John to be the school\u2019s philosophy teacher, after the previous one left without so much as giving him a two week notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the moment John started working for the school, and started \u2018persuading\u2019 the teachers and students to not eat the others, things for the school started improving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudent attendance was up, enrolment was up, grades improved, and someone would donate a large sum of money to the school every year for some reason. The money that was donated always had a letter that said, \u201cFor those who have hired a past student of ours, and currently works for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed to be connected to John\u2019s presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jeff looked at John, a strange smile, which he\u2019d never seen before, came to the man\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey prevent each other from doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they were told that if a fellow student ate another that they would fail because of that student\u2019s lack of control, it would motivate them to encourage each other to not lose control, or to not do it. They would keep a slightly careful eye on each other and give encouragement and help as needed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting idea John,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll allow it if this little experiment of yours happens to work. Now this is strange.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monitor showed some of the students walking over to Daniel, and handing him a portion of their lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre they allowed to do that?\u201d Jeff asked, as Daniel seemed to thank the students that gave him some food before he ate it. The students also seemed to be saying words of encouragement (the cameras couldn\u2019t, due to some privacy law, record any sound) to Daniel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John smiled and said, \u201cIt looks like I have students who care about each other enough to give up some of their own food so Daniel\u2019s hunger doesn\u2019t cause all of them to fail. I only said they couldn\u2019t stop him from doing whatever he wanted to do to Julia.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John smiled widely as he saw two of the students heading back to their seats, sharing a sly smile between themselves, Tawna and Justian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll according to plan,\u201d he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they had entered the classroom, they had talked about what they were going to do that day, and that Tawna and Justian would have to give Daniel the help that he would need. Of course, John was still worried, because anything could happen between now and when the class ended, in two hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, over the next couple of hours, as much as John saw that there was a small part of Daniel that wanted to rush up to Julia and devour her, the students made sure that he didn\u2019t have a real reason to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment that the urge to rush up to Julia strengthened, it seemed like there was a student getting out a portion of their lunch, heading to the student who was a wizard, having the size of the food increased, walking up to Daniel, and giving it to him to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said John, just as a young vampire gave Daniel a drink of blood. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they honestly care about Daniel, or if they would fear what would happen to them if he can\u2019t control his hunger, I think that this experiment has been a success.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d Jeff asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe students didn\u2019t try to stop Daniel from actually going for Julia, but they did give him things to satisfy his hunger at any rate,\u201d John said. \u201cThen again, they didn\u2019t want to fail because he couldn\u2019t control himself. If nothing else, they were compassionate for their own selfish reasons, which are a good motivator, for ones own gain.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you plan this out?\u201d Janelle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I told you last night,\u201d John said. \u201cGive someone a convincing reason to not do something, even if it is for their own greed and financial gain, and they will listen.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that before or after you had sex with my daughter?\u201d Jeff asked, with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was before that sir,\" John said, with a chuckle of his own. \"Besides sir, you would have to admit, she is very beautiful. Who knows sir; maybe she can tame this radical teacher of yours down, with your permission of course.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Jeff said, rubbing his chin. \u201cShe could use a good and steady boyfriend. (At this Janelle shouted \u201cFather!\u201d) One I knew wouldn\u2019t try to eat or rape her, trust me, I dealt with those who tried those stunts. Also, it would help if it was someone I trusted, and respected.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you say that sir?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell John, as much as I hate you personally, I can\u2019t help but admire you,\u201d Jeff said, with a smile. \u201cUnlike most teachers, you honestly try to get your students to try and improve themselves. Because of you, enrollment is up; the students\u2019 grades have improved.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I do prefer that those who want to go to my class have at least a C- in the rest of their classes,\u201d John said, with a slight chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed,\" Jeff said, as he looked at the man. \"But also, because of the fact that you always seem to be \u2018persuading\u2019 the teachers and students to not eat the others, for any reason, this school\u2019s finances have been improving, ever since the day I hired you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, thank you sir,\u201d John said, with some shock in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I mean it,\" Jeff said. \"During the five years you went away to that university, this school was in deep financial trouble, with students dropping out, failing, everything. Why this school was about to be foreclosed when you showed up, looking for a teaching position here. Ever since then, this school has come back from the brink, I managed to pay off the school\u2019s loans, get new equipment, hirer better teachers, everything. You practically saved this school. In fact, I just put a recommendation to the school board that you should be granted the position of Vice-Principal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious Sir!\" John said, his eyes bulging, as the spot had been vacent since he started to work there. \"I mean, that should really go to someone like Janus, she has more experience than I do. After all, she\u2019s been teaching here since-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell here\u2019s the funny thing,\" Jeff said, with a chuckle. \"It was she who recommended that you should be given it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused John to say,\u201cYou mean-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\" Jeff said, interupting him. \"She told me that you would be better at it than her. She says that her arthritis, from her previous injuries, prevents her from effectively doing what would be required of her. Also, she told me that the students wouldn\u2019t respect her as much as they would you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said that?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she did,\" Jeff said, with a smile. \"She also told me that she is planning on retiring next year, which is why I been having Janelle to sit in on her class and teaching some of her classes for the last few weeks.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John gasped, because he couldn\u2019t imagine Janus retiring. The harpy woman was the whole reason he became a teacher in the first place, and came back to this place to find work here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jeff said, \u201cWell John, you best get back to your class, and I wish you the best of luck, both with getting the position, and with my daughter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, as John walked out of the room, and headed to his class, Janelle said, in an annoyed voice, \u201cFather!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was why I called up a wizard friend of mine to put a barrier up for her. Imagine my surprise when it turned out that she was his long-lost niece. Needless to say, the guy didn\u2019t even bother to try and charge me for the job, as he went to deal with some people who had given him, and his late sister, ten long years of painful suffering,\u201d John said, as he lead Daniel to his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, its funny,\u201d John said. \u201cJulia\u2019s fine, none of the other students are missing, but for some reason, I don\u2019t hear your stomach growling as loud as it was when I left the room.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, some people gave me some of their own lunches that they had brought in,\u201d Daniel said, nervously. \u201cFor some reason, it helped satisfy my hunger.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s good to know,\u201d said John, as he went to his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the class, his fingers drumming on the top of the wooden desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he smiled and said, \u201cExcellent job students. Not only did Daniel manage to keep his hunger in check, but some of you helped him keep it in check, by giving him a portion of your own lunches. I\u2019m very proud of you, especially those who gave up a portion of your own lunch to help keep Daniel\u2019s hunger under control. Well, I\u2019m a man of my word so I have to say this; you\u2019ve all passed for this year.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the class cheered, causing more than a few teachers to stick their heads out of their doors to try and figure out what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever,\u201d John continued. \u201cI still expect you to attend class, and listen to lectures, as they will still count.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the class groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever,\u201d he said. \u201cEach assignment I give will count as extra credit. At this moment, your grades are the lowest they can get. For instance, if you are just barely passing my class with only a sixty-five, you could find yourself looking at, at least, an eighty. As for those with eighties, you could find yourself looking at over a one hundred. As for those close to or at one hundred already, well, I think you get the idea.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the entire class looked at each other, both in shock and awe. None of the other teachers had done anything like this. Sure they would give extra credit more often than Mr. Wolfstone, but that was only for a few students, who had to pleasure them to earn it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Wolfstone was going to give everyone extra credit, just for doing the assignments that they would have had to do anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then looked at him, as one student asked the question that was on their minds, \u201cMr. Wolfstone, do you really mean it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I do,\" John said, with a smile, something that seemed to happening a lot today. \"Of course, I still expect my rules to be followed, no cheating, and no eating of your fellow classmates, and so on. But, then again, how often is someone willing to do something like this, not very often. So, from now on, I expect you to get those assignments done and turned in. After all, I\u2019m not one who likes to change his mind on something. Well, that\u2019s it for today. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, oh and tell the others who also take this class what happened in here, after all, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to them if just you guys got extra credit and not them. So, any questions before you leave for your next class?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d a student asked. \u201cWhat about Samual Redblood? Will he also be getting extra credit?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the class stopped where they were. Would Samual Redblood, whom had broken more rules than the rest of the class combined, also receive extra credit? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn smiled at this and said, \u201cHow about we all decide his fate tomorrow? This will be your first assignment: Does Samual Redblood, really deserve to receive this extra credit? I want you all to write down the reasons on why you think he should or should not get it. Also, I want to see both sides of the situation, reasons on why he shouldn\u2019t get it, and reasons on why he should, no matter how small or insignificant. I want to see it all. Well, you guys best get going, though if you are a little late to your next class, tell your teachers that I held the class back for explaining a large project you have to work on. That is all. Class dismissed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the entire class left the room, talking about what just happened.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some time later, at lunch, John was sitting down, eating a beef sandwich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was smiling, because it seemed that today was his lucky day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Samual was being taken care of, in a way that should make him think twice before he said another rude comment about someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he, more or less, told the class that it was beneath them, as people, to let their urges control them, and gave them a good reason to not let them control them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Snapjaw had told him that he respected him, that he could soon become the Vice-Principal, and that he approved of him being with his daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had managed to get his students to like him, and several more things as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only real damper was that Janus would retire next year, but if there was one person who deserved a vacation, it would be her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the best day of my life,\u201d he thought, as he took a bite out of his sandwich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a voice asked, \u201cExcuse me, but is this seat taken?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked up to see Janelle smiling at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, not at all,\u201d he said, scooting over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize for my actions yesterday,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd thank you, for saving me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo apologizes or thanks needed,\u201d John said, with a smile. \u201cIf I met someone who did what I did to those students, I\u2019d call them a monster myself. As for saving you, well, that\u2019s a part of who I am. I save people everyday. If anything, it should be me apologizing for what I put you through.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that wasn\u2019t your fault,\" Janelle said. \"You had no control over your actions just then. Besides, you had safety measures set up, and your friends were able to take care of you then.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s a reason the different races should learn to live together in harmony,\" John said, as he looked at the woman. \"Alone, none of them could have stopped me, not the Highmans, not the Tailscales, not even my friend and his wife themselves, though it would have been close with those two. However, together, they were able to not only take me down, but make sure that I was still alive, and check to make sure that you and the others were alright.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you really that powerful?\u201d Janelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, do you remember that wolf that destroyed City Hall, the courthouse, those stockyards, those restaurants, and took on the police and city guard?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\" Janelle said. \"The creature caused several billion dollars in damage, but other than the police, the city guard, and those who worked at the stockyards and restaurants, it didn\u2019t harm very many other people, not even those held at the stockyards or those restaurants.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you care to make a guess as to who that creature was?\u201d John asked, with a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Janelle\u2019s eyes bulged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was you!?!\u201d she exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush, not so loud,\u201d John whispered. \u201cIf people found out, well, there would be trouble.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how did you become a giant, white, wolf?\u201d Janelle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure really,\u201d John said. \u201cI know that I was angry because of a law that was passed after my parents died. I have a feeling that my blood relatives and the Redbloods had a hand in that. As for everything else, it\u2019s a mixture of pictures and feelings. To be honest, I can\u2019t really remember what happened that day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d said Janelle, \u201cIt\u2019s the same with me. I remember turning on the T.V. in the classroom, and seeing, well, you, in front of City Hall and the courthouse. After that, just one big old blur. Next thing I knew, it was morning and I was waking up on the floor in the classroom, with all the students as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Julia said that she saw someone, but I haven\u2019t really thought about it,\u201d John said. \u201cHowever, Julia said that she had felt safe, and I had felt a presence, as if my mother was watching me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think it was?\u201d Janelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but some things are best left unexplained,\u201d John said, with a smile. \u201cMuch like how is it possible for a T-Rex to get a dragon pregnant, and have a human for a child.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Janelle blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d she said, turning her head away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I know this, your father has no human in him, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said John. \u201cAnd even if your mother was half human, that wouldn\u2019t explain why you are a full one. In fact, if the scent of the blood from that cut on your finger is any indication, you aren\u2019t even Jeff\u2019s daughter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am,\u201d Janelle said. \u201cHe\u2019s the man who raised me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I buy that,\" John said, as he looked into the woman's eyes. \"But, by blood, you are not. The only plausible logical explanations as to who your father is are, 1, a student Jeff took home, that his wife used as a sex toy, 2, a pet or a slave of some sort, and 3, a man your mother bought as a meal, had pleasure her, so he would tire out, before she finally ate him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Janelle\u2019s face twitched, as if John had struck a nerve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever,\u201d John said, as he turned his head back to his lunch. \u201cThat is something I don\u2019t care about. To me, it doesn\u2019t matter if one is, or isn\u2019t legitimate. You could be the daughter of this country\u2019s leader, or of a prostitute and some bum off of the streets. I wouldn\u2019t care about any of that. As my father once told me, \u2018What you are doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s who you are that is important.\u2019 And he and my mother would know. They were both children of human slaves and non-human masters, of different races each, but they still met, fell in love, got married, and cared for hundreds of children, all before I came along.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he turned his head, and, gently, had Janelle\u2019s face his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut like I said,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care who your blood parents were or are. I wouldn\u2019t even care if you weren\u2019t human. It\u2019s who you are, as a person that I care about. I wouldn\u2019t even care if you were of some branch of the Redblood family, and I despise the Redbloods, it would be you, as a person that I cared about.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re serious about that?\u201d Janelle asked, a tear running down her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn placed a finger just under the side of her nose, caught it and said, \u201cYes Janelle, I would.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then kissed her on the lips, much to the surprise of everyone watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnew I should have taken James up on that offer to teach me that illusion spell,\u201d he thought, the moment after his lips separated from hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that thought left his mind; the second Janelle kissed him back. \u201cThen again, that illusion would have been hard to set up. After all, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to mix the tails of a cat-person, a werewolf, and a kitsune with the blood of a giant, a naga, and a dridder anyways. It would be too much trouble for a few moments of privacy and pleasure.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, anyone could be someone who rents one of these places.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I know this much,\" Howard said, as he gave John a friendly slap on the back. \"With all these new workers I got, the rate of construction has picked up and now, I\u2019m more than ten months ahead of schedule. At this rate, that school-like building of yours will be done by next year at the earliest, with everything else being done two years after that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, here\u2019s a question,\" John said. \"What will you do then?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell, I might rent one of these places out myself. I took a look at the price for renting a place like this out on the internet, and their prices, just for rent, were sky high,\" the man said, with a slight huff. \"Hell, I can deal with the rule you have about not eating others, especially to live in a place like one of these.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really would do that?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d have to bring my wife up first,\" the man said, with a sheepish smile. \"You know how some women can get if a place isn\u2019t just right.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I understand that,\" John said, with an understanding smile. \"If my father and brothers didn\u2019t have the old place just so, my mother and sisters would complain until the sun set, the next day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I best get back to work,\" Howard said. \"You don\u2019t pay me to talk to you all day and those houses are not going to build themselves.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Howard turned around and started walking, towards where some humans were slacking off, and shouting, \u201cIf you three don\u2019t get back to work, I have a cousin who works at a meat processing company, and their looking for some new products.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused John to chuckle, as he opened the door to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the door, something rushed at him, and caused him to lose his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I just get a normal hello like everyone else?\u201d he said, picking up the thing that had rushed into him, Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia smiled and said, \u201cBut not everyone else is you, dad.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then gave her a hug and said, \u201cYah, I guess so. So, how was school today?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it was okay,\" the girl said. \"Though I don\u2019t know why you can\u2019t be both a philosophy teacher and a Vice-Principal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, cause then I might be tempted to always give you good grades,\" John said, as he kissed his recently adopted daughter. \"And that wouldn\u2019t be fair to the other students, like Tawna and Justian.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, why weren\u2019t you able to take me home today?\" Julia asked. \"Janelle had to walk me home.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s just say that it was one meeting after another with the parents of the students enrolling at the school,\" John said, with a sigh. \"Some of them were not pleased with some of our new rules at the school.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich ones would those be?\u201d Julia asked, with a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, first, there is the one forbidding students from eating other students, whether it was on or off school grounds. I got into a fight with over a dozen people over that,\" John said, with a slight smile. \"Of course, I won, and now the janitor is pleased to have a dozen assistants helping him out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what was the other rule that parents were unhappy about?\u201d Julia asked, knowing what the answer would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John smiled and said, \u201cLet\u2019s just say that it was about a rule named after you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Julia asked, knowing what it was anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Julia Rule,\u201d said John, knowing that Julia knew already, as he had ran it by her. \u201cAccording to it, the moment that someone, which is of schooling age, is brought onto the school grounds, they are considered a student of the school. Basically, if anyone and I mean anyone, brings someone of schooling age, if that person tries to eat that kid, well, if that person was a teacher, they just got fired, a student, expelled, someone else, kicked out and banned from entering the premises. As for the kid that was brought in, they become a student.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, the situation that caused me to meet you won\u2019t happen again?\u201d Julia asked, with hope in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t say that,\" John said, as he kissed the girl again. \"There will always be someone breaking the rules. However, if someone tries to eat someone like you, well, even giants would be overcome by the shear weight of the entire student body taking them on. That is because of another rule, it is the student\u2019s responsibility that the other students of the school are safe. So, the moment that a student sees another student in danger, on or off the school grounds, it is their responsibility to try and protect that student from harm.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething tells me that the parents were not happy about that,\u201d Julia said, as she tilted her head, and lifted an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\" John said, with a chuckle. \"I had to take on every other non-human parent because of it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you okay?\" Julia asked, slightly worried about ther man who had save her life. \"Were you hurt?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, only a few bruises on my chest, nothing too serious,\" John said, with another chuckle. \"Them, well, it was a good thing that the hospital was next door.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the two chuckled, as they both knew that there was no one person who could take John on. Only by working together could someone hope to take him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John asked, \u201cSo, besides you and me, who else is here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Uncle James and Aunt Clara showed up,\" Julia said. \"They said something about that thanks to their one assistant, that their new and improved invulnerability potion was a success.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s nice to know,\" John said. \"Now, all they have to do is find the right people that would find it useful, like the fire department. Seriously, there are some people who should be watched when they start using abilities related to starting and causing fires. I mean, on my way home, I put out at least three of them. Of course, I\u2019m talking about small things I could stomp out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an older female voice said, \u201cWell, you must have had a bit of an interesting day, getting into a fight with over one hundred non-humans, fighting fires, and who knows what else.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John smiled and said, \u201cWhy, hello Janus. I didn\u2019t expect you to show up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s what I came to see you,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she gave a slight sigh, and said, \"You know how my husband has been battling that cancer of his for the last five years?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me he died,\u201d John said, as he looked at his old teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t yet,\" Janus said. \"However, it could be anytime now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you want me to do for him?\" John asked. \"Give him a big old funeral, complete with paid mourners?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he wants a small one, with just family and friends,\" Janus said, as a tear fell from her eyes. \"Although, I think he would appreciate it if you did show up. However, he would like to visit this place, before he goes. He wants to see what the future could be like.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case,\" John said. \"I\u2019ll go over to the Highmans, so they can help you out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you John,\" Janus said, as she gave him a kiss. \"You have no idea about what this will mean to him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell tell him that when he crosses the pearly gates, to say hello to my mother and father,\u201d John said, with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, he\u2019d do that anyways,\" Janus said. \"It is because of them that he still has me you know, in a round about way that is, because you saved my life.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, give that son and daughter of yours my regards,\u201d John said, as he looked at the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill do John,\" the woman said. \"Will do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Janus walked outside and took off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia then looked at John and asked, \u201cIs her husband going to die? I like him, he\u2019s a nice guy. He shouldn\u2019t have to die.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d said John. \u201cHowever, when you\u2019re called up, you\u2019re called up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to die?\u201d Julia asked, with worry in her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John smiled and said, \u201cI don\u2019t plan on dying anytime soon. However, as my father always said, there are four things to be certain in life, people are born, paying taxes, dying, and of course, salesmen and priests that don\u2019t take no for an answer. So Julia, the answer to your question is this, yes, I will die. However, I hope that I won\u2019t, not until I have seen you grow up, get married, have children, see them grow up, and start having children of their own. Then, and only then, will I let death take me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John kissed Julia on the cheeks and said, \u201cNow, what homework do you have? I want to know about your day as well you know.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Guess it\u2019s a potential renter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked to the door, in his human form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, standing before were members of three families he never wanted to deal with. Two were his own blood relatives, a giant from the Megagains, a werewolf from the Wolfstones, and a vampire from the Redbloods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a first. Are you three here on behalf of your respective families?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the werewolf. \u201cAnd here is what we have to say, this land is ours.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what proof do you have to back this claim up?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d said the vampire, pulling out a piece of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a deed for the place, in the Wolfstone\u2019s and Megagain\u2019s names. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John just smiled and said, \u201cIs that all you have, because when I last checked, I\u2019m of both families, Wolfstone by my father, and Megagain by my mother. You will have to do a lot better than that, cousins.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, what\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Julia, coming to the kitchen, where the door was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCute pet of yours, John,\u201d the vampire said. \u201cI\u2019ll take her as payment for services rendered you two.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant looked at him and said, \u201cYou can have all of his pets. We\u2019ll take the land.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John looked at them and said, with a touch of anger in his voice, \u201cTouch a hair of my daughter\u2019s head, or harm anyone on my property, and I will not only kill you, I will wipe out your entire families. The only ones I may spare would be those younger than eighteen, but everyone else will die.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, you are not capable of that,\u201d said the werewolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are nothing more than a weak, half-breed, vegetarian,\u201d said the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, nothing more than a bag of blood for me to drink,\u201d said the vampire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at the vampire and said, \u201cI thought you looked familiar, Joseph. Does your head still feel like it\u2019s splitting?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the giant and said, \u201cHow\u2019s the leg, still in pain.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked at the werewolf and said, \u201cI went to that friend of mine\u2019s wedding. Too bad you weren\u2019t there to try and eat him, again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Joseph and the werewolf punched him in the face, at the same time, causing John to fly through the walls of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, are you all right?\u201d Julia asked, as she ran over to him, to help him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs John stood up, he spat out a couple of bloody teeth and felt some blood running out of his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. \u201cGet to your room now. These guys mean business, a business where the last one standing is still alive, and the others are dead. You will be safe in your room. If it can keep me out when I lose control, there is no way that that these weaklings can get in. Now go.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Julia quickly ran up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs John walked back to the front of the house he said, \u201cYou know what; I just had this place fixed up. I mean, do you know how hard it is to find some of this stuff? It\u2019s not like a wizard could build this place with a simple spell. It took a lot of hard work for the construction workers to build it the first time, and even more when I accidently destroyed it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the front, John asked, \u201cWas that the best you had? I\u2019ve known fairies who can hit harder than that. I should know about that, one nearly took my head off when I accidently stepped on her wings and broke one of them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the giant stomped his foot through the house, and drove him into the floor of the basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice one,\u201d said the werewolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gave him the perfect grave,\u201d Joseph said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s nothing,\u201d said the giant. \u201cI\u2019ll send the whole place to join him in Hell.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d said a familiar voice. \u201cHell\u2019s nice this time of year.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the trio to turn around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding behind them, all covered in dirt, was John, standing before a hole in the ground, with his claws beginning to retract into nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his werewolf cousin and asked, \u201cDid you forget that dogs like to dig holes in the yard to bury their bones?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the man charged him, but John stepped to the side, as the man fell down the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as he fell, a portal opened, sending him straight to Hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun, cousin,\u201d John said, as the portal closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, another portal opened and a demon, who was just a child, stuck his head through and said, \u201cThanks for the dog mister. I\u2019ve always wanted a pet.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you be careful with him. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been housebroken nor had his shots yet,\u201d said John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry mister, my mother and father will make sure of that,\u201d the demon child said, as the portal started to close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome here puppy,\u201d said the child, just as the werewolf started to scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t do this. John, don\u2019t leave me here like this!\u201d shouted the werewolf, just as the portal closed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice boy, that kid,\u201d John said. \u201cHis father went to the university at the same time I did.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d send your own cousin to Hell?!?\u201d Joseph shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope,\u201d said John. \u201cThe boy\u2019s father owed me a favor or two so I asked him to keep an eye or two on Paul for a while.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John grinned, wickedly, as he looked at his giant cousin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, to make things even more interesting,\u201d he thought, as he started muttering something under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange blue cloud surrounded the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it vanished, the giant just laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was the intent of that trick?\u201d he asked, looking at John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as he was about to stomp John, something felt weird. His clothes began to feel a little loose and baggy on him, and things started to get larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Shit,\u201d he thought. \u201cI\u2019m freaking Shrinking! I better kill him now while I still can.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before he could move, John took out one of his legs, which caused the giant to become trapped in his own clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet me out of here!\u201d the man shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem cousin,\u201d John said, as he moved the clothes to free the man, who was now the size of a normal human, and still shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp me,\u201d the man said, as his voice became high pitched, and he shrank small enough to fit in John\u2019s hand, when he finally stopped shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like being the size of a snack?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John gave a high pitched whistle, which caused a small human like woman, with wings on her back, to appear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Jenny,\u201d he said. \u201cI told you I\u2019d make it up to you for breaking your wings. I want you to meet my cousin Bobby. Bobby, this is Jenny. She\u2019s been looking for a shrunken human to play with.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a shrunken human,\u201d Bobby shrieked. \u201cI\u2019m a shrunken giant!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, that\u2019s even better than a shrunken human,\u201d Jenny squealed, in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did a cartwheel and then kissed John on the cheek, grabbed Bobby, and disappeared in a flash of light, as Bobby screamed in terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John said, as he turned around, \u201cWell, it looks like it\u2019s down to just you and me, Joseph.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then cracked his knuckles, saying, \u201cTime to finish what I started with that kick to your chest fifteen years ago.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Joseph began to laugh evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I\u2019ve almost underestimated you again,\" the vampire said. \"However, unlike last time, I came prepared.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith what sort of small army, Joseph, you fool?\" John asked, as he started to walk up to the man. \"You don\u2019t have anyone else with you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple,\" Joseph said. \"I know your weakness.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, silver and tall ass beanstalks?\u201d John asked, sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo John,\" the vampire said, as he gave an evil smile. \"Humans. You can\u2019t help but try to save them. Your weak human blood compiles you to try and help those pathetic creatures.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you before Joseph,\" John said, looking the vampire in the eyes. \"That if you touched Julia, I\u2019d kill you, and your entire family, as well as those of the other two.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho said it was your pet I was talking about?\" Joseph asked, with an evil looking smile. \"My nephew has told me of a young human woman you have fallen head over heels for. Now, what was her name, Jen, Jamie, Jessie, Jane? I know her name was something along those lines.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou even look at a picture of Janelle and I will do more than just kill you!\u201d John shouted, rushing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as John tried to tackle Joseph, he passed through him, like the guy wasn\u2019t even there, and crashed through the hole leading to the basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d John said, looking up, to see Joseph, with a struggling Janelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome to where it all began, tomorrow morning. Otherwise, your little trumpet will not live long enough to deliver her first child,\u201d the vampire said, vanishing, along with Janelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John said, \u201cDamn it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he thought, \u201cWhat did he say about Janelle not delivering her first child?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this he stood up, saying, \u201cShe can\u2019t be, could she?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bruised up my leg pretty good,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the other place?\u201d Julia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John lowered his head, crestfallen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy heart,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s got Janelle.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that, I\u2019m going to have to kill someone to save her,\u201d John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, you can\u2019t kill people,\" Julia said, with worry in her voice. \"You remember what happened to you when you killed someone last time. You lost total control of yourself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\" John said, as he exited the stairway. \"But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that my blood relatives, the Wolfstones and the Megagains, and the Redbloods, have Janelle, and, not only that, she\u2019s pregnant.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJanelle\u2019s pregnant?\" Julia asked, her eyes widening. \"When did you find out? Is it a boy or a girl?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just found out that she was pregnant,\" John said, with anger in his voice. \"Joseph mentioned it before he took off, holding onto her. I don\u2019t know if I am the father, and I don\u2019t care. If he harms her, or her unborn child, I will do more than just kill him, I will wipe out his entire family.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, you can\u2019t do that,\" Julia said. \"That would make you just like him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John stopped, looking out through the ruined front of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce again,\u201d he thought. \u201cHer age hides the wisdom that she knows.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kneeled down to look her in the eyes and asked, \u201cWhat do you think I should do kid?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia placed a hand on his cheek and said, \u201cFirst, you need to calm down, this fight and Janelle being kidnapped has you all riled up. If you don\u2019t calm down, and start to think clearly, you could head right into a trap.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try to calm down,\" John said, as he took a breath, and slowly released it. \"Is there anything else I can do?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you will need a plan,\" Julia said. \"And you may need some help.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\" John said, as he contenued to listen to the girl. \"Anything else?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to know where he wants you to meet him,\" Julia said. \"Otherwise, no matter what you do, you won\u2019t be able to rescue Janelle.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he said to meet him where it all began,\u201d John said, with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what do you think he meant by it?\u201d Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\" john said. \"The first place I met him was at the school where I beat, and severally injured, him. However, the only way one can enter the school is if one is authorized by the principal. I doubt that Jeff would give him permission when he learns that that man kidnapped his daughter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where else could he mean?\" Julia asked, as she looked her stepfather in the eyes. \"You\u2019ve told me that your family has had history with his. Maybe he means where your families first met?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John\u2019s eyes bulged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a genius,\u201d he said, laughing and hugging and kissing her. \u201c\u2018Where it all began,\u2019 that\u2019s what he meant. He\u2019s taken her to the stockyard my father bought my eldest siblings at. Father told me all about it. He said it was the worst place he had ever been at in his whole life, so he told me where it was so that I would never go there. In fact, the city demolished it shortly afterwards. Thank you Julia, you were a great help.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome John,\" Julia said, as she saw him smile, and was about to smile when she saw the hole in front of the door. \"But how are we getting out of the house?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, pieces of wood started to fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit,\u201d thought John, as he quickly covered Julia with his body, to protect her from the debris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey John, are you and your daughter alright?\u201d asked a deep male voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re just fine Joe,\u201d John said. \u201cBut next time, would you tell me that you are about to remove my roof.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\" the voice said. \"I would have helped you out sooner, but I didn\u2019t know where the big guy ran off to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly a giant would call my cousin that,\u201d John said, looking up to see Mr. Highman looking down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat guy was your cousin?\" the man asked, as his eyes widened. \"If he\u2019s like that on an everyday basis, no wonder you don\u2019t talk about your giant relatives.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell, I don\u2019t talk about any of my blood relatives much,\u201d John said. \u201cThey make demons seem like angles in comparison, and demons don\u2019t like being compared to those guys at all. Then again, I met an angle once, and personally, I thought that that guy was a little too high and mighty. Then again, I think that guy was really a harpy with a human body and white wings on his back. I kicked him off of my property because he was a traveling priest.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Joe chuckled as he put his hand next to the pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHop on,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not going to argue with that,\u201d John said, hopping onto the man\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce John had his feet back on the ground, he said, \u201cNow I know why I hate my blood relatives. Not only do they think humans are beneath them, and see them as food or sex slaves, they destroy things. I mean, I just got my house fixed up the way I liked it. It would have been perfect for parties, and there was a portion of the roof that was removable so that those who couldn\u2019t fit inside could still interact with those at the party.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really mean that I didn\u2019t have to remove the top of your house?\u201d Joe asked, as he looked at his landlord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyways Joe,\" John said, as he shaked his head. \"My cousin Bobby damaged the mechanism when he stomped down on the place. I\u2019m just glad that Julia\u2019s room wasn\u2019t over the kitchen. I mean if anything happened to her, well, let\u2019s just say it would make the incident a few months back seem like a child\u2019s temper tantrum in comparison. As it is, they\u2019ve kidnapped Janelle, and what\u2019s more, she might be pregnant.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn,\" Joe said, as his eyes widened even futher. \"And here I thought that those guys were just some really angry parents of some students that go to that school you work at.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019d prefer angry parents,\" John said, as he looked at his house. \"At least I\u2019d know why they\u2019d try to punch my lights out. Also, you can clearly see why I prefer my adoptive siblings and their relatives over my blood kin; at least they don\u2019t try to destroy the place when they get mad at me for some reason.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that,\" Joe said. \"Although I\u2019ll admit I was sorely tempted to eat that one, uh, what is he, nephew of yours when he said that giants were nothing more than oversized humans with anger management issues.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you did that, not only would you have proven him right, you would have lost the right to live here,\u201d John said, as he looked up at the relatively short giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah I know,\" Joe said. \"Though even you seemed to be getting a little upset with him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, the young man\u2019s just going through the stage every teenager goes through when they get that age, the rebellious stage,\" John said, with a wave of his hand. \"The stage of questioning their parents, calling them old fashioned, getting into trouble with the norms of society. I went through it, you went through it, and my students go through it. It\u2019s a part of growing up and becoming ones own person.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr, in the case of certain places, and people, getting eaten,\u201d Joe said, with a nervous chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I know,\" John said, as he looked back at his house. \"That\u2019s something I want to stop. As I learned from an early age, once you strip away what is obviously different between the different races, you will find out that people have more in common with each other than they realize.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\" Joe asked. \"Are you saying that giants and humans are similar?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\" John said, as he nodded his head. \"For instance, what is the hope of every parent?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat their child grows up healthy, has a successful career, and has children of their own?\u201d Joe said, with a questioning tone, as he looked at the human-sized size-shifting werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\" John said. \"Everyone has those sorts of hopes for their children. I have them for Julia, you for your daughter, when she gets older of course, the Tailscales for their son, and every other parent in the world. However, unless I save her, Janelle will never get that chance.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\" Joe said, as he looked at the man. \"I\u2019ll help you out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were willing to let my wife and I rent a house here,\" Joe said. \"Every other place either didn\u2019t have a house in our size, or they were filled up. Besides, there\u2019s something about Janelle that I like, though I\u2019m not sure what it is, but I like it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said John, as he started to walk towards the others.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How am I supposed to fight like this?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can help you out with that,\u201d said a deep voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJames, I wasn\u2019t expecting you to be here,\u201d John said, turning his head. \u201cJulia wasn\u2019t in any danger you know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d said James, kneeling down to look at his friend. \u201cBut I could sense her worry, and when that vampire assistant of mine said that his uncle was here, I knew I had to come.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoseph should have known his nephew was partially under your control,\u201d John said, with a groan. \u201cWhat is it that you have that will help me fight him if necessary? Is it something to fix my leg?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can heal your leg, somewhat,\u201d James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much is somewhat?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can reduce it to a minor sprain,\" James said. \"But that won\u2019t be enough to fight with.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell, even with a sprain I\u2019d be barely able to walk without assistance,\u201d John said, with a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that,\" James said. \"That\u2019s why Clara will help you out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you still need her to help you move?\u201d John asked, as he knew how bad James had been injured when he had dealt with those who had murdered his sister and kidnapped his niece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really,\" James said, with a slightly wicked smile. \"I\u2019ve forced Samual to do that for her. Guy makes a decent pair of pants and shirt, don\u2019t you agree, Samual?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll kill you,\u201d said a muffled voice. \u201cI will choke you to death.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot likely,\u201d James said, pulling on his sleeve, as if he was going to tear it. \u201cYou need me to turn you back to \u2018normal\u2019. I guess that means until then, you be and do as I say. Now tell us, what is your uncle planning to do to Janelle?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t say a thing with that vegetarian around,\u201d the shirt said, with a huff in its voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better talk,\u201d John said, grabbing a hold of the shirt and pants, a.k.a. Samual. \u201cOtherwise I will tear you in half. I know that James has Clara, so he wouldn\u2019t be naked for long at any rate. You on the other hand, will be in pieces, as if you were a rag, and then burned like one. Now talk, you little shit stain.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\" Samual said, with fear in his voice, as one of the threads started to give way. \"He will kill her if you don\u2019t show up, except.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept what, Samual?\u201d John asked, tightening his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept that he is not able to kill her,\" Samual said, with a bit of a grumble. \"Blood cannot kill blood after all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\" John asked, as he knew that, biologically, Jeff was not Janelle's father. \"Is Janelle a Redblood or of one of you family\u2019s branches?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that human is nothing more than a piece of human trash is all,\" Samual said, with contempt in his voice. \"However, she is pregnant with one of Redblood blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExplain yourself Samual,\u201d John said, as he pulled tighter on the shirt and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy,\" Samual said, with some smuggness in his voice. \"Before you saved her, Uncle Joseph had his way with her, before he left her to his cronies.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice try,\"John said, with a growl. \"She wasn\u2019t raped. I would have smelled it on her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if he had washed her afterwards,\" Samual said, with some fear, as a seem started to tear. \"He then altered her memories, so she wouldn\u2019t remember it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, why did his men try to kill her?\u201d John asked, with anger in his voice at this revalation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, they weren\u2019t ordered to kill her,\" Samual said, with even more fear, as John started to shift his hands into claws. \"They were to throw you off the scent, and to kill you if possible.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, does your uncle think that I will kill Janelle to kill his child?\u201d John asked, as his face started to become wolf-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe probably does,\u201d Samual said, in a tone that suggested that he would of wet his pants if part of him wasn't a pair already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you tell him this,\" John said, as he shifted back into his human form. \"I won\u2019t kill Janelle, not even to kill his child. The child is an innocent, unlike him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John let go of the clothes, and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen James said, \u201cHe\u2019s not completely right.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d John asked, with a sob/growl in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is true that Janelle carries a child of a Redblood,\" James said, as he put a hand on his friend. \"But she also carries one of your bloodline.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\" John asked, as he looked up at his friend, something that he wasn't used to doing himself. \"Is she pregnant with my child as well?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes John, she is,\" the wizard said, with a light smile. \"When I saw her last week, I sensed two lives growing in her, one of a vampire, with blood similar to Samual here, and one with blood like yours, part human, part werewolf, and part giant.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious?\" John asked, his eyes bulging. \"A child of my blood grows in her?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am very serious about this,\" James said, as his smile widened. \"You are the father of one of the children.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow old are they?\u201d John asked, as he started to think, as the only time that he had had sex with Janelle was just the one time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost three months old,\u201d the wizard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn,\u201d John said. \u201cHow am I going to tell her father, both about her being kidnapped, and being pregnant?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know already,\u201d said a deep voice, which was followed by the ground shaking heavily.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They killed Nadine, my lovely wife, killed me, and took her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then placed his hand next to John and said, \u201cSave my daughter, and my grandchildren. They may not be of my blood, but they are still, mi-ii-ine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, his eyes just glazed over, never to see the light of living again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeff! You can\u2019t leave yet!

When this is over, the whole school is yours. I know you will take good care of it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know that you are putting a whole lot of faith in the same person who broke your nose and busted a couple of your ribs,\u201d John said, with a nervouse chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd who would be better to do the job anyways,\" Jeff's ghost said. \"I saw the fight you had with those parents. Even when they ganged up on you, you still took them on and took them out. I know that you will keep those students safe, not only from each other and the teachers, but from other people. You have the heart of a protector, which is what a school needs in a principal. I know you will do the best damn job you can do. Now, let\u2019s go get my daughter back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast ghost,\u201d said James. \u201cJohn needs to be healed up, and even then, he won\u2019t be able to walk without help.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen get to work wizard,\u201d Jeff said loudly. \u201cI can\u2019t rest until my daughter is safe and sound.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she will be,\u201d James said. \u201cThe bastard who killed you and took her has two major weaknesses.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would those be?\u201d the ghost asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, one of the children Janelle carries is of his blood,\u201d James said, pointing at John. \u201cThis will help to strengthen any spell I place on him, so he can beat him. Second, the other child is of that bastard\u2019s blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jeff asked, with some worry in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one who killed you and kidnapped, and had raped, your daughter, was a Redblood,\" James said, as he gave a sly smile. \"And if I know my races, vampires cannot harm those who are, or carry those of, their blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jeff chuckled wickedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd they know what their relatives know,\u201d he said. \u201cExplains how the Redblood on the school board knew about my plans to change the school\u2019s rules before I even talked to the board about them. Little Redblood heard me and sent the information, even though he\u2019s not even born.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff then looked at James, saw his clothes and asked, \u201cIs that Samual Redblood you\u2019re wearing?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it is,\u201d James said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Jeff said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at Samual and said, \u201cTell your uncle that a ghost from his past says \u2018hi\u2019 and by the time John is through with him, he will wish that I had failed him and turned him into fertilizer for the school grounds.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, that person didn\u2019t take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer and tried to rape me. Well, I landed a blow on \u2018her\u2019 and realized that \u2018she\u2019 was a shape-shifter. What\u2019s more, that shape-shifter was really a male one. Now, if he had been in a male form, I might have understood, but, as it was, I almost killed him, not because he was a shape-shifter, though I had a slight fear of shape-shifters for a while afterwards, but because he had tried to rape me. If he hadn\u2019t done that, I may have taken you up on your offer back then.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you probably should have told me about it years ago,\" Clara said. \"I mean, I may enjoy sex as much as the next shape-shifter, but I would never try to deceive someone about my gender, nor would I force myself on someone who didn\u2019t want to have sex, as that would reduce my personal pleasure.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah well, I\u2019m still not in the mood for having someone encase my entire body,\u201d John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how about your entire leg?\" Clara asked. \"That way you could focus more on running and fighting, instead of where to put your leg.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah that idea might just be able to work,\" John said. \"Just do me a favor, if it becomes necessary for you to encase my body with yourself; just don\u2019t mess around with my reproductive organs. Besides, I don\u2019t think James would like it if you were cheating on him with me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Clara chuckled, as she covered John\u2019s entire leg and foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce John got used to moving with Clara covering his leg, he walked back to the houses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of the ruins of his was a large group of people, ranging from renters, those who lived with them, construction workers, friends, family members, and those who owed him favors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn John,\u201d said James. \u201cIs there anyone that you didn\u2019t want me to contact?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, my blood relatives and the Redbloods,\u201d John said, with a bit of sarcasm in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the group, which was easily several thousand people strong, and of many races. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at James and asked, \u201cDid you tell them why I wanted them here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I told them that Joseph Redblood kidnapped the love of your life and your unborn child,\u201d James said. \u201cOf your family, almost everyone came, except the elder and younger ones. All your friends from school came, because you saved their lives plenty of times. Our collage classmates are here. These guys that rent homes, or live in them, are here. The construction workers say that you gave them a chance when no one else would. Also, you had me call up all those who owed you favors, including a demon of all things, to see if they wanted to return them, and help you out. Are you sure you wanted all of them?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\" John said, as he looked at his friend. \"The more advantages I have compared to my blood relatives and the Redbloods, the better. They are not above using dirty tactics and would try to ambush me the first chance they got. Even if I am able to survive one, it could weaken, and delay, me. I don\u2019t want to be surprised, but I do want to surprise them. So I want you and anyone else who knows magic to get to work on disguising the others. Oh, and I need you to loan me something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would that be?\" James asked. \"I know that you know some magic, but I know very well you can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, use some of the spells that I know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho said it was magic that I wanted,\" John said, with a chuckle. \"It\u2019s what you are wearing that I what to borrow. If Janelle\u2019s unborn baby can keep her safe from the Redbloods, wearing Samual should do the same for me, right, Samual.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the shirt and pants seemed to shake, as if nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will kill you for what you\u2019ve done to me. Because of you, not only did I fail school, I\u2019m stuck living with this jumped-up piece of prey for the rest of my life,\u201d said an angry voice from the shirt\u2019s collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t me that failed you,\u201d John said, calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it was!\u201d Samual shouted. \u201cYou put the \u2018F\u2019 in the computer that caused me to fail.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWrong,\u201d John said, grabbing onto the collar, as if he was grabbing Samual\u2019s ear. \u201cYou were the one who continued to make trouble for everyone in the school. That and the fact that you gave yourself bad grades was the reason that you failed, not me Samual. Also, it was your fault that you insulted James, his wife, and his niece, not me. The only one at fault for all the faults that a person has is themselves. My father always said, \u2018Son, in life you have to make choices. These choices affect who you are.\u2019 Now, as you know, I could have chosen to be the most vicious monster out there. No one, not even an army of giants, could ever hope to stop me. However, I chose not to go down that path. I chose to protect people instead of eating them. I chose to fight for people, so that they can enjoy their god-given rights, to live, to be free from persecution, to be happy, to not end up as someone\u2019s meal, slave, pet, or some sort of toy. My father, may his soul rest in peace, told me, before I left for Harmony University, \u2018Son, it isn\u2019t your age or species that makes you a man. It is who you are and what you do that makes you a man, or a true monster, and you, my boy, you are no monster. You are a true man where it counts.\u2019 Then he said that he was proud to be my father, and that was followed by a few other things like, get good grades, mind the teachers, make some friends, and then, make a girlfriend or two that I would marry and have kids with. You see, my mother and father raised me to look at people for who they were and not what they were. To them, a werewolf was the same as a human, which was the same as a giant, which was the same as a demon, which was the same as a harpy, and so on. They told me not to judge a person by their race, but by their deeds and intentions. They taught me that there was no difference between humans and non-humans where it truly counted, in their hearts and souls. They told me that everyone has the same hopes, the same fears, the same everything, once you stripped away the physical differences, like race, magical abilities, diets, and so forth. They told me that everyone is equal, with a few exceptions, like parents and their children, bosses and their employees, and those sorts of things. However, all people in general are equal, right from the very moment you see through their eyes, you will see the truth, which has been hidden from sight for centuries. It has been hidden from us since our creation, because we were too blind to even see a glimmer of it. However, there are those who see the truth, that all are equal in the eyes of the creator. Us weak vegetarians, as you call us, have seen the light, in one way or another, for one reason or another. We know the truth, the truth no one wants to see or face. We have seen the truth that we are murderers, rapists, and thieves of life and innocence. That is what our whole society has been built on, murder and rape. We have been taught for generations that the strong are above the weak, and that they are to be our slaves and meals. However, those who have take the path of Realization, as I call it, know the truth. That is why I live with the pain that I suffer, for I feel the guilt of my sins, for the lives I taken, even if I didn\u2019t eat them. This pain is what drives me to complete my tasks in this life, to make sure others in the future never have a reason to feel even a smidgen of it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John let go of the shirt collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am going to give you a choice Samual,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can help me, become free and go back to school. Or, you can stay as James\u2019s assistant, for the rest of your natural life, never getting the chance to go out into this world, find a girl, marry her and settle down, and have children, and so many other things.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to set me up again, like you did when you had that human sit in my chair,\u201d Samual said, angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I am,\u201d John said, with a smirk. \u201cAnd maybe I\u2019m not. I am giving you a chance to earn your freedom. If you don\u2019t want it, don\u2019t take it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John turned around, and started to walk towards the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d said Samual, nervously. \u201cI\u2019ll take it. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he turned around, saying, \u201cAre you sure you can face your uncle, by your own free will? The man is very powerful, and has plenty of tricks up his sleeve. I was lucky when I faced him both times, the kick, back when I was in the seventh grade, was a once in a lifetime fluke, and today, he was only here to deliver a message. When I face him tomorrow, there is a very good chance we could kill each other. However, our reasons for killing the other will determine where he and I will go in the next world, whether it is on the other side of the pearly gates, or burn in the eternal flames of Hell. My reason for killing your uncle is this, to protect others from monsters, like he and I, because there are indeed times that I do consider myself to be a monster indeed. Your uncle\u2019s reasons are, for revenge for what I did to him, and because of the feud that has been going on between your family and mine for the last seventy or so years. Know this Samual, what I just told you is the truth, by this time tomorrow, me and him could both lie dead on the ground. After that, we will be judged, and sent to face either our punishment, or our reward. Personally, I don\u2019t know if I will cross the pearly gates, or burn in the eternal flames of Hell because of all of the things that I have done, but I get the feeling that your uncle will burn.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d be correct on that one,\u201d said the demon. \u201cThe fallen one tells all in his family who will burn, and since I am of his line, I know what he knows. The one, known as Joseph Redblood, WILL BURN!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the demon began to chuckle evilly, with a wicked smile on his face, causing everyone to move away from him in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever,\u201d he said, looking at John. \u201cI am not sure about you. The future about where you will go is shrouded in both the flames of Hell, and the light of Heaven.  For all I know, you could both burn in the flames and bathe in the light. Needless to say, your fate is yet to be decided. Then again, as your father said, the future is ones own choice to make, which will determine if they burn in the flames, or bathe in the light.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, those things are nice to know Steve,\u201d John said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I owe you for your help tutoring me in those math courses, and when I was accused of cheating in that English class,\u201d the demon, Steve, said, with a friendly smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, like I told you then, I judge by deed and intention, not race or stereotype,\u201d John said, grabbing onto his shoulder. \u201cHowever, I have two things I\u2019d like you to do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cName them, and they are yours, for free,\u201d Steve said, as red smoke started to curl around his black horns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell first,\u201d John said. \u201cI want you to take good care of my cousin Paul, don\u2019t be too gentle, but, at the same time, don\u2019t be too mean. After he has learned his lesson, I want you to let him come here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, what is the second favor?\u201d Steve asked, with a bit of a wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that I want you to deal with Joseph,\" John said. \"If I\u2019m dead and he is not, finish him for me, especially if he is dying anyways. If he\u2019s dead, and I\u2019m alive, or dying, if his soul comes for me and/or my family and friends, at the very least, make sure my family and friends are safe at any rate.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what if he comes for you instead?\u201d the demon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if I\u2019m going to survive, deal with him in whatever manner you see fit,\" John said. \"If I\u2019m dying, and I won\u2019t survive, well, he won\u2019t have long to wait to try and fight me again. However, if our fight is too dangerous for the world of the living, do whatever is necessary to protect the living, including exorcising both of our souls.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do realize that the only way a demon can exorcise a soul is to devour it,\u201d the demon said, as his firey eyes looked in to the brown ones of the mortal before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\" John said, calmly. \"But I\u2019d sooner suffer for an eternity as opposed to letting him having his way with the living.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would risk your soul for the sake of your loved ones?\u201d Steve asked, with a knowing smile, as John had made a contract with him, back in collage, that he would send the souls of real monsters to him, and deliver the soul of the one who had murdered his girlfriend himself, providing that he kept him alive until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you?\u201d John asked, with a knowing smile. \u201cYou fell for my sister and married her, and had a son with her, remember?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I\u2019d trade my horns, tail, and pitchfork for a pair of wings, a halo, and a harp, if that gave me the power to protect them,\u201d Steve said, with a light chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least you know how far I\u2019d go to keep those that I care about safe.\u201d John said, as he started to walk back to the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he said, \u201cHey James. I expect Samual to fit me, and to conform to whatever shape that I am, like a set of shape-shifter clothes. I may have to use everything I\u2019ve got against Joseph.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha John. I won\u2019t let you down,\u201d James said, with a shout. \u201cNone of us will.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you guys won\u2019t,\u201d John said quietly, with a smile.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, John was walking towards the abandoned stockyard, using a pair of crutches to help him to walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d said a young male voice, which was coming from one of the crutches. \u201cWhy do you need me and Tawna to be crutches?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho said that you and Tawna were to remain crutches, Justian?\u201d John asked, looking at the crutch that had spoken. \u201cJoseph knows that he injured me, somewhat. A set of crutches will help back that theory up. If he thinks that I am weak physically, he will underestimate my strength. Besides, it\u2019s not as crutches that I need you two for.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what is the reason?\u201d Tawna asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, someone has to get Janelle away from Joseph, and it can\u2019t be me. Even with Clara\u2019s help, I can\u2019t run very fast with my leg the way it is,\u201d John said. \u201cThat means that, at least, one of you must do it. Besides, I want to make Joseph wonder what tricks I\u2019ve got up my sleeves. I want him to see how outclassed he really is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, John was at the spot, for the meeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, searching for signs of an ambush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he sensed something behind him and quickly turned around, bearing his fangs and the claws on his right hand, dropping the crutch that Justian had been turned into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what he saw caused him to retract his fangs and claws. Behind him had been a bunch of young men and women, mostly between the ages of thirteen and eighteen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d he asked, kneeling down to look them in the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he saw the truth, they were the ghosts of those who had been sent there, and never left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you here to help us?\u201d a young ghost boy asked, walking up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith tears in his eyes, John placed a hand near the boy\u2019s cheek and said, \u201cYes son. I am here to help you out. Can you tell me why you and the others are still trapped in this horrible place?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause your father promised that he\u2019d get all of us out,\u201d the boy said, with tears in his eyes. \u201cBut I got sold and eaten before he could. The others had similar fates, whether it was before your father first came here, or afterwards. We are all waiting for him to free us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d John said, a tear falling down his cheek. \u201cBut my mother and father died a little over five years ago. As a result, they couldn\u2019t help you. However, I\u2019m here now, and I will help free you. But first, I need some help myself. I am looking for at least two people, a pregnant human woman, who has two lives growing inside of her, a human/werewolf/giant hybrid like me, and a human/vampire, who is of the blood of the other that I am searching for, a male vampire that is slightly older than I am, and is of the blood of the vampire I\u2019m currently wearing. Have you seen them?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d the boy said, pointing a finger over John\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThey are that way.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d John said. \u201cWere they alone, or were there others with them?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are others with them,\u201d the boy said. \u201cThere are at least a hundred of them, vampires of the blood of those who ran this place, and werewolves and giants that share your blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for your help,\u201d John said, making a motion, as if he was patting the boy on the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy seemed to smile at this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you sir,\u201d he said. \u201cIs there something else you want us to help you with?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d John said. \u201cThere are several hundred others following me, some distance back. I would appreciate it if you, and the others, could lead them to where I will be.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will do that,\u201d the boy said grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John picked up the crutch that was Justian, and started walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy then looked at the others, and said, \u201cFinally, after all these years, we shall be free of our suffering. Let\u2019s do what we can to help him out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other ghosts nodded, and vanished, to help the son of their hero out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, John found himself near a dilapidated building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Clara,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been to stockyards before, right.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I have, while James and I searched for Julia, though she wasn\u2019t called Julia then,\u201d Clara said. \u201cBut anyways, I think that this would be the processing office.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess,\u201d John said. \u201cHere is where the children would be sold, their pictures taken for records, and rated as if they were livestock instead of people.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, that\u2019s right,\u201d Clara said, with a low sigh. \u201cJames destroyed many of these places as we searched for his niece. As a result, I have a good idea on what these places look like.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if the right people were in office, things like this would never be built again. The remains would stand as reminders of the dark side of people\u2019s natures, and as a warning so such things will never happen again,\u201d John said, with a hint of anger in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he sniffed the air and shouted out, \u201cJoseph Redblood! Come out here and bring Janelle with you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr what, you\u2019ll huff and puff and blow the place down?\u201d Joseph said, standing at a window, holding onto Janelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at her and saw that, while her clothes were mostly torn and she was disheveled in appearance, Janelle was okay, if a little scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then looked back at Joseph and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t come out here with her, you will see what this hot bag of air can really do to you. You got lucky the last two times, this time, only one of us will walk away.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! I can do that anyways,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cAll that I have to do is take those crutches away, and you will fall over, unable to move.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoseph, even with only one leg, I can still take you on,\u201d John said. \u201cIn fact, I challenge you to a duel to the death, winner take all! I win, I do whatever I want to you, your family, and your allies, and I take your collective fortunes. You win, you can take everything that is mine, including those who are my family, and do whatever you want to them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting conditions,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cYou\u2019d risk everything all for a piece of human filth, which is nothing more than prey.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you got that wrong. I\u2019m going to marry her someday, and I\u2019ll raise our children, whether they are of my blood or not, to be vegetarians, who will never hunger for the flesh of their human kin,\u201d John said, with a solemn look on his face. \u201cThat goes for the one she now bears because of you, as well as that of my own blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he smiled, seeing the look of shock on Joseph\u2019s face, though he was a little concerned about the look on Janelle\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d John said, looking at her. \u201cBecause you carry the child of a Redblood, none of the Redbloods can harm you, so you can walk out of there, in relative safety.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Janelle started running as fast as she could towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to John, Janelle wrapped her arms around him and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to help them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Janelle. When I\u2019m done with him, I\u2019ll give a \u2018helping\u2019 to the others,\u201d John said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that,\u201d Janelle said. \u201cThey\u2019re holding a relative of each of the city\u2019s politicians\u2019 families\u2019 hostage, including the mayor\u2019s daughter. They\u2019ve also got the politicians themselves in there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy god,\u201d John thought. \u201cIt was bad enough when I thought that they were just bribing the politicians, but this, this is worse than just kidnapping and holding someone for ransom.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John said, \u201cHow about we also duel for control of the city as well? I win, you let the politicians and theirs go free and never interfere with the city, ever. You win; you get total control of it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it John,\u201d Joseph shouted. \u201cWhat are the rules for the duel?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe fight naked of everything except what we were born with,\" John said, looking the vampire dead in the eyes. \"No clothes, no weapons, and absolutely no assistance from anyone. The first person to disregard them not only forfeits the fight, they will lose their life. The fight goes until one of us gives up, is unable to get up, or is killed, with the one left standing being the winner, even if he is also on Death\u2019s bed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Joseph smiled and said, \u201cSo, even if you killed me, if I fall second, I still win.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have my word,\u201d John said, solemnly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI accept the terms, and the conditions of the challenge,\u201d Joseph shouted.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Imagine the suffering that they have been through and you will see why. The things that James has done to you are nothing in comparison. I fight not only for them, and others like them, but for everyone. Your uncle may fight on behalf of your family, but he really fights for himself. Hell, I\u2019m even fighting for his sake, because I want him, and everyone else, to see the truth, and the light.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then put the shirt part of Samual on a tree branch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow know this Samual,\u201d he said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t fail school.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Samual asked, quite loudly, as no one else could hear him anyways. \u201cWhat do you mean? I saw my grade for your class. It was a big fat \u2018F\u2019.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because that was the grade you would have gotten, except for one thing, an experiment that I had between Daniel Leathertail and Julia,\" John said, with a smile. \"The experiment was whether or not Daniel could control his hunger and not devour Julia.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell obviously he didn\u2019t but what does that have to do with me?\u201d Samual asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis actions dictated whether the entire class would pass or fail,\u201d John said, in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they must have failed then,\u201d Samual said, in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo they didn\u2019t,\" John said, with a chuckle. \"The class would have failed if even a drop of Daniel\u2019s saliva had landed on Julia. The guy put a hole in the wall so he couldn\u2019t get to her. Then, some of the other students started to help him out, by giving him a portion of their respective lunches. When the time was up, I had reentered the class, as I was in Jeff\u2019s office during it, god I\u2019m going to miss that man, and I told them that they had passed, and that from then on, everyone was to get extra credit. Well, just before the class left, one of your classmates asked if you were to get the extra credit, as well. I told them that that was up to them, and they had to give me reasons as to whether or not you got it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they must have said no then,\u201d Samual said, with another huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, that was the surprise,\" John said. \"They said that you should, and besides, everyone, including you Samual, had passed anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John to the pants part of Samual off, and placed it on the branch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink about what I said young one,\u201d he said. \u201cShould I not survive, the spell on you will wear off by midnight tonight, and you will be back to normal, or as normal as a blood drinking vampire can get.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, John took off his last piece of clothing and turned around to face Joseph, who was also naked of clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you forgot your cast,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do I know you don\u2019t have a weapon in there?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at Clara and whispered, \u201cYou better act like a shape-shifting cast, so don\u2019t say a word or do anything that a cast wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at Joseph and said, \u201cIt would be a little difficult for me to fight if I didn\u2019t have it on. If you want to, have someone pat it down for a weapon, like Janelle here. Otherwise, quit stalling, so you and I can fight, and see who will kill the other.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d Joseph said, \u201cLet\u2019s finish what we started, over fifteen years ago!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two combatants faced the other, neither one moving, waiting for the other to make the first move, the first mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, the two still hadn\u2019t moved when the others arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d James asked, looking at Janelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething about it being a duel to the death.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious? He couldn\u2019t be serious. He isn\u2019t the type that would even consider dueling.\u201d James said, worriedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Janelle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right,\" James said, slapping his forehead. \"I forgot that, as a human, you wouldn\u2019t have taken the same sorts of school classes as non-humans. Well, basically, if two non-humans have a dispute, whether it is over prey, a mating partner, or hunting grounds, or even something else, that is important to both, should an understanding not be reached, the pair can fight, to the death. There are various that both parties have to follow, no clothes, no weapons, and no assistance from anyone. Failure to follow these rules will result in the death of the combatant that breaks them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames then looked at John, with worry on his face. He knew the truth about the cast on John\u2019s left leg, it was his wife. Just by having her on his leg, John was breaking the rules, but without her, he couldn\u2019t fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long have they been facing each other?\u201d Joe asked, coming from behind a tree and getting down on one knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least an hour,\u201d Janelle said, looking up at the kneeling giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, the first move should come soon,\u201d Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Janelle asked, worried for John's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in a few of these sorts of things,\" Joe said. \"It always seemed that luck was on my side during them. The first move is the most risky one.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Janelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt could end the fight then and there,\" Joe said, as he watched the pair facing each other. \"The person who makes it could kill the other, or be killed himself by the one who waited and held his ground. Now, I know John is very powerful, that time when he was out of control shows it. I don\u2019t know about the other.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh he\u2019s powerful alright,\u201d Howard said, walking up to them. \u201cThe bastard killed my older brother, because he killed a woman my brother cared about, so my brother attacked him, in broad daylight. However, the bastard\u2019s friends helped him out, They held onto him, as the bastard killed him. I was there that day, seven years ago, and I watched him die, as that bastard drained him dry of every last drop of blood. The man\u2019s a coward, but he\u2019s a powerful one.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I know this much,\u201d said James. \u201cThere must be an arbitrator.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, who would be neutral enough to be a judge for the fight?\u201d Joe asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at him,\u201d James said, turning his clothes into those of his classification, a dark wizard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, you\u2019re John\u2019s friend,\u201d Janelle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard,\u201d said James. \u201cWizards, and the like, especially those of my caliber, have no friends, or family, only acquaintances. After all, friends and family cause us to weaken.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, James just cracked a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he said, \u201cOf course, the real truth is, we just don\u2019t like to admit that we are humans with the gift of magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked out onto the field of combat, in between the two combatants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here, Human?\u201d Joseph asked with anger in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames just looked at him and said, \u201cI\u2019m here to judge the fight between you, vampire, and the hybrid. If you want to argue about my right to judge, you do so at your own risk.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d trust him on that Joseph,\u201d John said. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with this wizard before, and his powers scare the shit out of me, and that\u2019s a feat that few can make.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames then walked up to Joseph and asked, \u201cDo you want to argue my right to oversee the fight?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Joseph said, with a hint of worry in his voice, as he had seen James\u2019s eyes, which was one way to tell the power of one with magic, because the more solid in color it was, the more powerful the person was, and James\u2019s were pitch black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d James said, as he turned around and started walking towards John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to John, he whispered, \u201cYou do realize that by wearing Clara that you are breaking the rules of dueling.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d John said. \u201cIf a combatant has a prior injury, which would prevent him from fighting, a shape-shifter can be used to help the one be capable of fighting, as long as it doesn\u2019t fight itself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d James asked. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such a rule.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s an old one, an obscure one, which was written down over one thousand years ago, when a king\u2019s crippled son had to fight in his stead, because he himself was too ill to fight,\" John said, as he whispered to his friend in an equally low voice. \"The prince had taken a shape-shifter for a bride, and she was the only reason he could walk around. Given how the king had no one else to fight for him, and this was a duel to control the kingdom, over whether or not his, or another family, would rule it, the assistance of the shape-shifter was allowed, as long as she didn\u2019t fight herself, and suffered the same consequences as the prince, if he lost. However, he won, by his own power, and cunning. The exception/assistance rule was written down, and later forgotten.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how do you know it?\u201d James asked, because only certain people were the holders of any lost knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteve told me about it last night,\u201d John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe demon told you?\u201d James asked, as he always had a sence of distrust for the demon, ever since he first met him in collage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, he knew that I was crippled and he told me about that duel, which his great-grandfather had judged,\u201d John said, as he started to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, James smiled and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it funny as to how a demon knows everything about what their ancestors have seen, and can know something of the future as well?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, now get into position, judge,\u201d John said, with a slight smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen James got to the side, where he could watch the fight, John looked back at Joseph. He slowly grew his fangs and claws, as Joseph grew his own fangs and his nails grew a couple of inches, becoming sharp and turning themselves harder than steel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about I give the first move to you,\u201d John said, tapping the side of his neck. \u201cThat way you can get a taste of my blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGladly,\u201d Joseph said, rushing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he bit John\u2019s neck vein, and started sucking away, Joseph felt a sharp pain in his neck, and found out that he had no feeling in the rest of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d he asked, as he found himself being lifted away from John, who laid him on the ground, gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI paralyzed you,\u201d John said, placing a hand on the blood coming from his neck. \u201cI may be a monster, but I won\u2019t kill someone in cold blood. Since you are no threat to me now, I expect you to hold your end of the deal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would sooner die than admit defeat to the likes of you, Vegetarian,\u201d Joseph said, with a growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then placed a claw over the man\u2019s jugular, and was about to stab him through the throat, when he smelled something moving towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Julia; with worry in her eyes, which seemed to say, \u201cJohn, please do not kill him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at Joseph, and sighed, as he retracted his fangs and claws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you,\u201d he said, standing up. \u201cI don\u2019t kill in cold blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then walked over to Julia, and picked her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you going to kill him?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was,\u201d John said. \u201cBut then I remembered something that you told me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou told me that I wasn\u2019t a monster, and only a monster would kill a defenseless man,\" John said, as he looked at the crippled vampire. \"Joseph\u2019s no threat now. I doubt that, even with the finest medical attention, he will ever walk again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the crutches, Justian and Tawna, and the clothes, Samual, and muttered a few words under his breath, turning the three of them back to their normal forms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Justian said. \u201cThat was a long faceoff, but when he charged you, you took him in one blow.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d Tawna asked. \u201cI could barely see the two of you move.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you guys were lucky,\u201d Samual said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see a thing, but I heard him run at you, bite your neck, drink some of your blood, and then, that snap of neck vertebra. To be honest, I thought he killed you, until you spoke. Just how did you beat him?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John smiled, and lifted his hand from his neck, exposing two holes that were in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA vampire is very vulnerable when they bite into someone\u2019s throat,\u201d he said. \u201cA smart victim would do well to make an attack on the part where the neck joins the back. If they did that, depending on the spot hit, and how hard it was hit, the vampire will either fall unconscious, become paralyzed, or end up dead.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d Samual asked. \u201cDo you mean to say that you could have ended my life at any point in class?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could have,\" he said. \"Given how I wanted to become a teacher, I thought it wise to learn the weaknesses of all the different races, because I had the feeling that I would have to deal with the parents of students who might want me dead, for one reason or another. So, I took some classes in anatomy, and talked to my classmates, telling them that I was planning to become a teacher, and wanted to make sure that I could handle angry parents or students, without killing them, or harming them too badly.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, who told you about a vampire\u2019s weak spot?\u201d Samual asked. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a secret.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just smiled and said, \u201cLet\u2019s just say that I know a two-bit illusionist, who is, also, one hell of a womanizer, who had sex with the girlfriend of a vampire, that I had to make a deal with. I told him I\u2019d let him drink my blood for the rest of the semester, if he left my roommate alone. Well, he accepted, and I noticed, that whenever he feed off of me, he never went for my neck, even when I offered it to him. On the last day of the semester, I asked him why. It was then he told me that someone snapped his brother\u2019s neck, when he bit into the man\u2019s neck to drink his blood, killing him instantly. It was then I realized that if I ever had to fight Joseph, or another vampire, again, that my best chance for beating him would be to strike him in the back of the neck. I guess that deal finally paid off.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John tapped on a scar on the back of his left arm, near the wrist. It was similar to the wound on his neck, two puncture marks from a vampire\u2019s canines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, if you don\u2019t mind, I need some clothes. I hate to walk around naked, even if I\u2019m in my werewolf form,\u201d John said, looking at James, who tossed him a set of shape-shifter clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he said, after he put them on, \u201cTake Joseph and the others to my place, including those in that building over there. We have some things to discuss.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what about you John?\u201d James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have some things that I want to talk to Janelle about,\" John said, as he looked at his friend. \"As well as talk to some people who are trapped here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand John,\" James said, as he got some things out of his pocket. \"I\u2019ll see you at your place.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, a pitch black cloud of smoke covered the area and vanished, along with everyone, except for John and Janelle. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could have been killed, you stupid fool.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just smiled and started stroking her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to know that you care about me,\u201d he said, kissing her cheeks. \u201cBy the way, I think your father wants to talk to you for a bit. He\u2019s over there in the trees. As for me, there are some people that want to talk to me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay John,\" Janelle said, as she stood back up. \"After I talk to my father, you and I need to talk about something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d John said, gently placing a hand on her belly, which had a slightly rounded look to it. \u201cI know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he smiled, as Janelle walked into the forest, to see her father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she disappeared into the forest, John looked behind him, to see the ghost children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, will that do the trick?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that will do,\u201d the ghost boy from earlier said. \u201cThank you, monster who has the heart and soul of a human.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the ghost children disappeared, crossing over into the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn smiled, as he heard the laughter of children playing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope to get to know you better,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that will be when it becomes my time to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he heard someone crying and saying, \u201cFather, don\u2019t go. I need you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Janelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard a deep voice saying, \u201cI will always be with you, daughter. I am proud to have raised a daughter such as you. Even if you can\u2019t see us, me and your mother will watch over you, and help you when you need it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked towards the woods, just in time to see a flash of light come and go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoing to miss you Jeff,\u201d he said, as he grabbed a branch from the tree he was under, and used it to stand up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then started limping to where he heard Janelle crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he saw her, she was in a clearing, which was filled with flowers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him and said, \u201cHe\u2019s gone, he\u2019s gone for good. I\u2019ll never see him again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about you never seeing him again,\u201d John said. \u201cBut, whenever I was going through some tough times, I could almost swear that I could hear my mother and father giving me information, from beyond the pearly gates themselves.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying that he will be there for me?\u201d Janelle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just smiled as he limped close to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d he said. \u201cHe really does love you. He held on long enough to tell me what happened to him and your mother, and stuck around to make sure that you were safe from harm.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder how he\u2019ll watch me,\u201d Janelle said, placing her arms under John\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked up at the sky and said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if it is true or not, but my father once told me that the spirits of one\u2019s loved ones are in the clouds and stars, looking down on those they care about, and giving them the help that they need. At least, that was what his mother, a human, told him before, well, whatever it was that happened to her, because my father never told me her fate, same with my mother about her human father. But, they would always say that they could hear them, even when I knew that they had to be dead. Now come on, let\u2019s take you to my place. I don\u2019t think that your place would do you any good anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut John, how are we going to get there?\" Janelle asked. \"Your leg seems to be broken, or something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John just chuckled and said, \u201cJust hold on tight, I\u2019m going to call up my brother in-law. If nothing else, my sister can persuade him to help us out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, who\u2019s your brother in-law?\u201d Janelle asked, as she didn't know much about John's extended relations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLet\u2019s just say that the only thing that scares him is my sister, when she is angry and going through her period,\" John said, with a chuckle. \"Now hold on tight, it\u2019s about to get very hot around you and I.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The guy had some very large feet.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he chuckled and looked at Janelle, who was smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks John,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause you have been there, for me, during the time I\u2019ve been mourning.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then placed a hand on her cheek, catching a tear that had been threatening to fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father trusted me to take care of you,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, me and the school, the two most important things in his life,\u201d Janelle said, as she placed her head on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I know this much,\u201d John said. \u201cI certainly have a new respect for him. Less than a week on the job and I\u2019ve already parents threatening to pull their children out of school.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and convince them otherwise?\u201d Janelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn what manner do you suggest?\" John asked, with a sigh. \"Threatening to eat them would do me no good, because their children have probably told them that I\u2019m a vegetarian. I can\u2019t force the students to stay in school. There isn\u2019t much that I can do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you could use blackmail,\u201d Janelle said, with a sheepish look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, father kept a folder in the bottom drawer of the desk,\" Janelle said, as she pointed at the large desk. \"He told me that, before he passed on.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid he tell you what was in it?\u201d John asked, curious about this folder he had never heard of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Janelle said, \u201cHe said that it had information that you may want to know about.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John chuckled, and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019d be right,\u201d he said. \u201cI would want to know about it, especially if it keeps students from being taken out of the school.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then walked around to the other side of the desk and grew to the same height Jeff had been, thirty feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when he sat down in the chair, something didn\u2019t feel quite right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis chair was defiantly not made for me in mind,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Janelle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John pulled a skull from a hole in the cushion, looked at it, and said, placing the skull in his pocket, \u201cI don\u2019t think you need to know what your father\u2019s personal preference in seat cushions was. Needless to say, I won\u2019t be using his seat after today, at any rate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then looked at the drawers, both inside and out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite finding plenty of bones, and placing them in his pockets, he couldn\u2019t find any hidden folders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything seems to be accounted for,\u201d he said out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncluding a bunch of bones the guy had,\u201d he thought. \u201cRemind me to give them a decent burial.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard a voice say, \u201cThanks for putting my remains in one spot buddy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John stiffened. The voice was coming from next to his leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looked down, he saw the spirit of a young man sitting on the leg that had the pocket containing the bones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked, in a voice that Janelle couldn\u2019t hear, but a ghost would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I used to be Mrs. Snapjaw\u2019s personal sex toy, until about twenty-five years ago, when she got pregnant,\u201d the spirit said. \u201cAfter that, her husband had me turned into a seat cushion, which I was, until I died, staring up at his ass. Not the way I wanted to go. After that, he placed my remains in different drawers in his desk, except for my skull. He left it in that damn cushion, which has caused me nothing but suffering. So thank you buddy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d John said, still using a voice that Janelle couldn\u2019t hear. \u201cI\u2019ll see to it that you will get a proper burial.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the ghost said. \u201cIs there something that I can do to repay you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d John said, rubbing his chin, as if deep in thought. \u201cDo you happen to know where Mr. Snapjaw kept any hidden folders at?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d the ghost said, with a smile on his face, which seemed very familiar to John. \u201cThat bastard had a hidden drawer installed under the desk. I hope that you deal with him, in the manner that he deserves.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to worry about him anymore,\u201d John said, reaching under the desk. \u201cHe was murdered last week, protecting someone that I think that you should know about.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho was it, my former master? That bitch was nice and all but she shouldn\u2019t have given me up. I hope she died to,\u201d the ghost said, angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d John said, as he bumped the desk, in a way that caused a picture to fall on the floor next to them. \u201cIt was your daughter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then reached down and turned it face up, showing Janelle\u2019s picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the ghost gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA daughter,\u201d he said, with excitement, and worry in his voice. \u201cIs she alright?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John nodded and said, \u201cYes, thanks to him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe protected my daughter?\u201d the ghost asked, looking at the man who had found his remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, at the cost of his life,\" John said, with a light smile. \"Oh, and congratulations, in six months, you\u2019ll be a grandfather, to two fine wonderful babies.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, can you tell me, my daughter\u2019s name?\u201d the ghost asked, as he placed his hand on the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John smiled and said, in a voice that Janelle could hear, as he grabbed a loose panel under the desk, \u201cJanelle.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the ghost smiled, and vanished, crossing over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he vanished, Janelle came over, looking at John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou found something?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d John said, pulling on the panel. \u201cI think your father placed a drawer under the top of his desk. Explains why he\u2019d tell you that the folder was in a drawer on the bottom of the desk, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he made a final pull, and took the panel off of the desk, and pulled it out, for them to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there wasn\u2019t just one folder in the drawer, but several dozen. On top of each folder was a set of letters, A-Cc, Cd-Fe, and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, on top of the stack was a note, addressed to John. He picked it up, and set the drawer down, so Janelle could search the files. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, John looked at the note, and felt his throat start to dry. With a nervous gulp, he tentatively extended a claw, and carefully removed the seal from the note, as it was Jeff\u2019s personal way of marking important documents, using some wax from a blue candle, and a weight, which had the symbol of the school on it, his face, as he had started the school himself, with the help of certain wealthy families. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When John opened the note, he saw what Jeff had written him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe note said, \u201cJohn, if you are reading this, Congratulations. I know that you may think that you may not ready to fill my shoes. But know this, you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The files in these folders tell you everything you need to know about the families that these students come from, how much money that they make, any criminal records that they want to keep quiet, scandalous information, legitimacy, if they were born of a relationship between a slave and its master, and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Use this to provide leverage against those who try to pull your students out of the school. I know that you will keep the students safe, as well as keep the school running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'P.S. Take good care of Janelle for me. I raised her because I felt bad about what I did to her father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'P.P.S. Could you give Danny, Janelle\u2019s father, a decent burial? He didn\u2019t deserve that I did to him, though I will say this, he did make one hell of a nice seat cushion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John gave a slight grimace, as he folded the note back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there were two things that he hated, beyond making humans one\u2019s meal, or sex slave, it was the practices of using them as living furniture and jewelry, or as part of one\u2019s under garments. Those people were stuck in a pose, and sprayed with something, that kept those parts sprayed from moving, or feeling any pain. They were kept alive only by the courtesy of those who bought them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuddered at the memory of his one step-brother, who was nothing more than a living chair, which his father had bought. Despite his parents\u2019 best efforts at trying to restore his mobility, he was stuck like that. The only things that helped alleviate his pain were the facts that he married a loving wife, who currently took care of him, and the children he had with her, as only his head, and another part of his body, hadn\u2019t been sprayed with the stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn also remembered a sister of his. She had been turned into a living piece of jewelry, with a diamond pierced through each of her butt cheeks, and a ruby pierced through each of her breasts, and a length of gold chain wrapped around her arms and legs, as she had been made being made into a necklace, when his mother placed a higher amount of money on the table, than the woman who had tried to buy her first. Needless to say, the storekeeper accepted her offer, which was three times the amount that the other woman had offered. After that, John\u2019s mother took special care of her, giving her a comfortable place to rest, the first plate at every meal, with the one who was a living chair being served second, and many more things. However, despite his parents\u2019 best efforts to remove the gems and the chain, she was stuck the way John\u2019s mother had bought her as. However, a giant girlfriend of hers, as they were lesbians, was currently taking care of her, treating her as a person, instead of as a piece of jewelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs John cleared those thoughts from his mind, he got out of the seat, and shrank down, shrinking the bones as well, until he was his \u2018normal\u2019 size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle looked at him and asked, \u201cJohn, are you alright.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d John said, slightly lying, as he wiped a tear or two from his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just going to miss him. He may have been, to me, a bit of a blood-thirsty hard-ass, but, where it counted, your father was a good man. I\u2019ll admit that he and I argued over everything, but, I won\u2019t even try to deny that he only did, what he thought, was right for the school, as well as, for you, Janelle.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, he walked over to Janelle and wrapped his arms around her, and placed his head on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father truly was a good man,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is something that no one can deny. I know that I won\u2019t. The only thing that I wonder about is which thing did he cared more for, you, or the school. But I guess that, that really doesn\u2019t matter. All we need to figure out now is this, what did he leave us to help us keep our students in the school.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let us get started John,\u201d Janelle said, as she started to open up one of the folders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Janelle, not us, me,\" John said, as he carefully closed the folder, and gently took it out of her hands, after giving her a gentle kiss. \"You need to get to your class. I\u2019ll get to work on checking out these folders and files.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay John,\" Janelle said, as she kissed him back. \"Just don\u2019t forget about the meeting in the auditorium at one o\u2019clock.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for anything,\" John said, as he looked into her eyes, betraying nothing about what he had found out about both Jeff and her biological father. \"After all, someone has to unveil a statue to your father\u2019s memory.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few hours later, in a packed auditorium, John stood on the stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in his Mr. Wolfstone guise, with a cold look, facing everyone, from the various staff members, and from the youngest of students, to the oldest of students. This meant that the room was so silent, that even a human could have heard a pin land on a carpet, and located the spot where it was, without error. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked out at the auditorium and saw that smaller students and teachers were in the front, and the taller ones were in the back. This was so everyone could see him, and he could see everyone, in turn. He drummed his fingers on the podium, watching everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStudents and staff, we are here to remember a great man,\" he said. \"A man who was so great, no one person could say how great he was. I\u2019ve known Jefferson Johnson Snapjaw ever since I started school, back when I was six years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When I first saw him, at the school meeting held in the auditorium, which is held during the first week of the school year, I was so scared, I\u2019ll admit that I both wet, and soiled, my pants. Needless to say, I had the first couple of front rows to myself, so he defiantly saw me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Over the next few years, I avoided him as best as I could, until I was sent to his office, for hitting the teacher, when I was in the second grade. Considering it was close to lunchtime, I\u2019ll admit that I was scared. Thankfully, my mother was there, reminding him of something that he had done when he was my age, which convinced him not to punish me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The next year, it was the same thing; I hit a teacher and got sent to the office. This time, my father was there, showing him some pictures he had taken. I never found out what they were about, though I can make a few guesses, but he didn\u2019t punish me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'However, the next year, I broke his nose, when he tried to discipline another troublesome student, by trying to eat him. Needless to say, he started choking, and well, I felt bad for him, so I did the Heimlich maneuver on him, saving his life, and that of the other student as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Given how I had nearly caused him to die, and in turn save his life, he forced me to choose between being failed, or, on the other hand, taking the other student to be my pet. Well obviously, I took the other student to be my pet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Needless to say, while my parents knew why I hit my teachers, they were a little upset that I had gotten myself a pet without them knowing, until I told them why. It was then that they told me what it was that I should do next time it happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'After that, I got myself a few more pets, until it happened. I had killed my fifth grade teacher, in a manner that I shall not speak of, saving a fellow student\u2019s life. After that, everyone, including Mr. Snapjaw, feared me. They feared the very thing that I was, which happens to be a giant-werewolf hybrid. Before that day, everyone assumed that I was just a werewolf that preferred to remain in his human form, until the right moment. After that day, they realized that I could also turn myself into a giant, and even, a giant werewolf.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John smiled, wickedly, as everyone else, with the exception of a few, seemed to pale in fear, after all, size-changers were very rare, especially those who were werewolves, and all had a reputation of being very dangerous, and highly unpredictable. Even regular giants, and wizards, were afraid of them, and they themselves could be quite dangerous to be around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John continued his speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, that sort of thing caused the wrong person to have an unhealthy interest in me. He offered me some things if I helped him take over the school, and this was when I was in the seventh grade mind you, and he was in the twelfth. I told him that I wasn\u2019t interested, and that all I wanted to do was get through school without any further trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Unfortunately, trouble had found me, in the form of a vampire from the Redblood family. He attacked me, and a teacher who tried to protect me from him. Well, the teacher, Mrs. Janus Clawfoot, was severally injured by the time I pulled him off of her. I told him that he\u2019d have to go through me to get to her. Well, he tried, and ended up in the hospital because of it, literally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Needless to say, I was in even more trouble than I thought possible. Instead of my parents facing him, Mr. Snapjaw had to face the head of the Redblood family. The man tried to force him to turn me over to them, or they would cut all funding to the school. Well do you want to know what Mr. Snapjaw told him? He said, \u2018Go ahead and cut your funding, Redblood. You\u2019re just upset that a weak \u201cvegetarian\u201d beat the heir to your family\u2019s fortune. You want him because of what it would mean between your family and his. Try and take him, if you dare.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, Mr. Redblood was about to fight him then and there, for possession of me, when my mother, father, brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, and everyone else related to my brothers and sisters, showed up. Well, as the saying goes, \u2018When one is faced with overwhelming odds, it is best to rethink your strategy.\u2019 Well, I don\u2019t know if Mr. Redblood ever heard about it before, but he certainly realized it that day. He settled for my parents paying for the younger Redblood\u2019s hospital bills, and me being put under the supervision of a teacher for a month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'After that, the school was, more or less, run my way. While I hadn\u2019t set out to take control of the school, after that fight, teachers, and students, didn\u2019t do anything that would set me off. However, Mr. Snapjaw struck up a sort of friendship with me, that if he had a troublesome student, that I would take care of him or her.\u201d At this, John paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was then,\u201d he said. \u201cThat I began to see a different side of him. It is a side that few show, their true selves. I soon realized that, behind his rock hard scales, was a warm, beating heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course, those times were few and far between each of them. For some reason, they always reminded me of when my mother and father got good news about me and my siblings. It wasn\u2019t until recently that I found out why they seemed to look like it, but that\u2019s for later on in my speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'However, for the most part, he was still a grouchy old lizard who\u2019d rather bite your head off than give you the time of day, especially around mealtimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When I went to Harmony University, I thought that that was the last I\u2019d see of him, and this school. I was planning to be a chef, and cook vegetarian meals in a vegetarian restaurant, much like the one my parents first met in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'However, I received some news that changed my life forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A young woman, who told me, and I also felt the same way, that she wanted to marry me after we graduated from our respective collages, was murdered, all because someone wouldn\u2019t eat something other than another person.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John gave a low, angry growl, which frightened everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I heard about it, I was devastated. I, more or less, disappeared from the collage scene. In fact, I considered killing myself. I was about to carry it out, when it hit me. I could use the pain that I felt to teach others, so that they would never feel the pain that I felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, I went to my advisors, and had my classes changed from cooking, to teaching. When I graduated, with high honors, I came here, looking for a job. Of course, I found out that there were some legal matters I had to take care of first, as my mother and father had passed away and there were some problems over who was going to get their inheritance, which I am not going to talk about here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When those matters were dealt with, I received a call from a friend of mine, Janus Clawfoot, who retired at the end of last year, that there was an opening for a philosophy teacher here, as the previous one left without even giving his two week notice to Mr. Snapjaw. Needless to say, I was the only one who applied for the job, as most other people were quitting, because the school had fallen on hard times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When he saw me walk into his office, he nearly had a heart attack, and practically hired me then and there. Now, those of you who have had me for these last few years, you know what I am like, how I keep you from eating others and such. You know that I do things to protect others, even to the point that people fear me because of what I could do to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, unknown to the rest of you, Mr. Snapjaw was of a similar nature. Here, he was a cold-hearted bastard, but, at home, he was a devoted husband to his wife, and a loving father, to his only daughter, who was born as a human, whom many of you know as Miss Abigail, as she didn\u2019t want her students to see a connection between her, and her father.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, everyone gasps, and looks towards Janelle, who was quietly sniffling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d John said. \u201cIt came as a shock to me when I found out that Mr. Snapjaw was a father, and that Janelle was his daughter. That was the reason why, when I had seen him with smile on his face back when I was in school, he was happy during those few times, because he had received good news about her, like on her grades or projects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'However, there is more, especially about the way he died. He had received some very important news about Janelle, which I\u2019ll let her say when she wants to. Anyways, after he received the news, and was most likely looking for ways to deal with what it would mean for him, someone broke into their home. Mr. Snapjaw\u2019s wife was killed instantly. Jeff though, tried to hide his daughter, to protect her from the intruders, and went to fight them off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'However, despite his best efforts, one of the intruders got her, and just as Jeff was trying to get her back, he was struck with a mortal blow to the back of his head. He was helpless to rescue his daughter, so he limped to the one person he knew who would save her, me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At the time, I had just dealt with some intruders of my own, who told me that they had kidnapped Janelle. Jeff asked me to go and save his daughter, before he died. He also told me that I was the best man to take on his job, and well, I\u2019m not one to argue with the dead. I went, saved his daughter, and told her the news that he had told me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, tears threatened to fall from John\u2019s eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a moment guys,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got something in my eyes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took a tissue from a box next to him, wiped his eyes, and then, blew his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn seasonal allergies,\u201d he said, tossing the tissue into the trash. \u201cAlways occurs around this time of the year.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, no one argued that he didn\u2019t have allergies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways,\u201d he said. \u201cJeff, I hope that you accept this small token of my appreciation of you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John walked outside, grew fifty feet, and took the canvas off of the statue, and smiled, as he shrank back down. There, in all its glory, was a granite statue of Jeff, sitting at his desk, looking at the school he loved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unlike how he normally looked, the statue had a slight sparkle in its eyes, and a light smile on its face, though one had to look carefully to see them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, the statue was the same Mr. Snapjaw everyone knew, and dreaded to meet up with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs John walked away from it, he saw Janelle looking at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s him alright, cold on the outside, yet warm on the inside.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think your father would like it?\u201d John asked, as he looked back at the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\" Janelle said, causing John to look at her, and noticed a smile, as she looked at him, and hug him. \"He\u2019d LOVE it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a feeling that you\u2019d say something like that,\u201d John said, kissing her on the cheek. \u201cNow let\u2019s get back inside. I still have the rest of the meeting to go through.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In it, he says that I am the one who is best qualified to take on the role of school principal. Now obviously, he intended that I was to get the job when he either retired or died of natural causes. However, he placed his faith in me, in that I can do the job. So, this is what I have to ask the teachers: Is there any of you to dispute the claim of Jefferson Johnson Snapjaw, and if so, explain the reason as to why I should not be the principal of the school?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re too young,\u201d shouted an elderly male naga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how long have you worked here?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver forty years,\u201d the naga said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what have you done to try and improve the school during that time?\u201d John asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the naga said, \u201cI guess I best rest my case, though I still say you\u2019re too young.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll say this,\u201d John said, as the naga sat back down. \u201cHe does bring up a good point, I am young. However, even the most elderly of people were young at one point, and prone to making mistakes. I, myself, will probably many several of my own, before I get on my feet, as it were. Now, besides my age, are there any other reasons as to why I should not be principal?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about the fact, that, you are of human blood?\u201d asked a two hundred foot tall giant, who was the gym teacher, who was the successor of the one John had permanently crippled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was speaking through a hole in the ceiling, which was a sun roof. Also, for the most part, his classes were either taught outside, or in a special building with a glass ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked up at him and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, Jonny Tootall, I am of human blood. In fact, I embrace it, which is why I am usually in this form, this weak, human, form. However, did you know that in proportion to their body weight and size, humans are stronger than giants?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpossible,\" the man said. \"I can carry ten thousand pounds.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, but you are what, at the very least, twenty thousand pounds,\u201d John said, with a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I am close to that weight,\" the giant said. \"What is your point?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, when I went to collage, I saw a three hundred foot tall, thirty thousand pound, giant, and six foot, two hundred pound human challenge the other to a contest using weights,\u201d John said, still looking at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess,\" the giant said, crossing his arms. \"The giant won.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even close,\" John said, with a chuckle. \"That giant lifted a mere weight of twenty thousand pounds. That human though, he lifted an impressive three hundred fifty pounds worth of weight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill sounds like the giant won to me,\u201d the man said, giving John something of a nasty grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, the human lifted less weight over all,\" John said, as he returned the man's grin, with one of his own. \"But, that giant lifted two pounds of weight to every three pounds of his body. The human lifted three and a half pounds to every two pounds in his body. Now, when I last checked, I think that a ratio of 2:3 was less than a ratio of 3.5:2, or in another way, 4/6 is less than 6/6 which is less than 10.5/6. Now, unless you plan on going on a diet, Mr. Tootall, wouldn\u2019t grabbing a second plate of food that was three-fourths of the way full sound a lot better than just having only one plate that was only two-thirds of the way full?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\" the man said, after a bit of thinking. \"It would.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that means that you just admitted that humans are, proportionally, stronger than giants,\u201d John said, with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Mr. Tootall became very quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen John said, with a strange smile on his face, \u201cOf course, if having human blood is a reason for me to not be principal, than by that reasoning alone, you cannot be in the running. After all, I have a very credible source that tells me that your mother is a human.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo she isn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Tootall said, angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, are you trying to tell to tell me that, Maria Tootall-Bigone is not your birth mother?\u201d John asked, seeming to be puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\" the man said. \"She is my birth mother.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThan why is it that, in the city\u2019s records, she is listed as a human?\u201d John asked, as he looked at the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d the man asked, as his eyes started to widen, wondering how anyone could get that information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple really,\" John said, in a conversational manner. \"I know someone in the accounting office at city hall. She is very helpful, especially since, she\u2019s one of my nieces.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s against the law to give out someone\u2019s personal information,\u201d Mr. Tootall said, with a bit of anger in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, then in that case, you, and many others, should be arrested for multiple rapes and murders,\" John said, looking straight into his eyes. \"However, people like you seem to get away with it, while humans are executed for them, in the same way that you murder others.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John growls, loudly, causing Mr. Tootall to back up, and trip, falling into the middle of the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Jonny boy,\u201d John said, loudly. \u201cDo get back here, so we can finish this discussion.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mr. Tootall crawled back to the schoolyard, he sat on his knees, and didn\u2019t bother trying to stand at his full height. He was scared, because he had seen John Wolfstone\u2019s eyes, which were filled with a cold, burning, hatred, as if he despised something about him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let\u2019s see here,\u201d John said. \u201cYou say that your mother is not a human, while the city says she is. Well the funny thing is, both you, and the city, are right. Your mother\u2019s birth parents are indeed giants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'However, she was born the size of a human baby, and grew at the same rate as a human. By the time she stopped growing, she was only six feet tall, a snack to someone of your size. However, despite the fact that your grandparents were several times larger than her, at four hundred feet, they still gave her the greatest of care, probably hoping that she\u2019d grow, at least, to the size of a small giant, say fifty feet. Of course, she was still only the size of a tall human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'However, she met your father, probably early on in life, and married him. Now, there is the question of how she got pregnant with you. I have four possible ideas, two of them dangerous for her, with one of them being somewhat annoying for your father, a third involving your father giving her a shower, as it were, and using a towel to help her out, and the fourth, which is the most probable one, a doctor helped them out, with him placing some of your father\u2019s sperm in a container, held onto your mother, in such a way, as to cause your father\u2019s sperm to enter her fallopian tubes, and become pregnant with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then, there was the pregnancy itself. At some point, you had to be removed from her, and placed inside of a surrogate, probably one of your aunts. After all, any giant woman can give birth to a baby weighing several hundred pounds, but a human woman would have trouble giving birth to a fully developed child weighing twenty pounds, let alone giving birth to one several times her own size and weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, let\u2019s talk about my mother. My father and her, they had trouble having children, after all, it took them almost forty years before they were blessed with me, so, they did the next best thing, they adopted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'By the time I came along, my mother and father, had adopted over seven hundred children, and were still adopting them by the time I left for collage. I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if they had died while adopting a child, though, from what my siblings told me, they died at home, though they still adopted until that point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, my mother and father had their work cut out for them, rising that many children is no easy feat mind you. I can recall my brothers arguing over things like, who stole who\u2019s toy, who was to help with the dishes, take out the trash, and my sisters complaining about their clothes not being right for the outing, that they had to use this type of makeup, and both of my parents running hither and dale, getting everyone to their appointments, activities, making sure everything was good. Talk about devotion, it was only during the school year that my parents could have any time to themselves, after, of course, my mother retired from being a teacher, and my father hung up his medical license, when I was ten years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, now that you know about the devotion my parents had for me and my siblings, let\u2019s talk about yours. Your mother, at the very least, had to clean you, feed you, clothe you, sing lullabies so that you would sleep, and several other things. Given the fact that you are here, she must have done a good job, though it seems she forgot to teach you to respect others. My mother and father made sure that I would, especially after I found out about my size-changing abilities, and helped me out, so that I wouldn\u2019t bust the bed every night at least. They also taught me how to control myself, even if I am hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Something tells me that if you got hungry, you\u2019d just murder someone, to fulfill that need, or, should I say, desire. Me, I\u2019d just wait, until I was home, warm up some left over venison or beef, from non-sentient animals, and eat that. In fact, I had given my class a very high risk challenge, a pass or fail one, depending on whether or not one of the students could control his hunger for the class period, especially since, he didn\u2019t have breakfast. Well, he did, and so, I passed the class. Heck, I gave them extra credit to do the work that they would have had to do otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don\u2019t think that you, or most others, have even that level of control. Care to say otherwise, Mr. Tootall? Can you honestly say that you wouldn\u2019t eat someone, who was the size of your mother, if you were hungry?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Mr. Tootall gave a nervous gulp, and shook his head no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d John said. \u201cAt least you\u2019re honest about it. Now, is there anything else that you think makes me unsuitable for the job?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d said a man, who just came in. \u201cI hear that two of your grandparents were slaves, and slaves can\u2019t own property, same with their offspring, and so forth. In fact, your family is nothing more than a group of outlaws that managed to slip through the cracks of the law, because their respective son, or daughter, was a non-human.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re a slave-catcher, looking for runaways,\u201d John said, with a deep level of anger in his words.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have that right,\u201d the man said, with contempt in his voice. \u201cIn fact, I hear that you took over the families of your masters, as well as that of the main branch of the Redblood family.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! You give me too much credit,\u201d John said. \u201cAll I did was beat the three who had the biggest grudges against me. Everything else was just a nice bonus. Besides, I had a little bit of help from my friends, including, a member of the Royal House of Demons of Hell, as well as, a very powerful dark wizard.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, two deep and powerful, voices, one with fire and brimstone, and the other with an overwhelming amount of darkness, said, \u201cSomeone called/summoned me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the right side of the stage, a dark black cloud appears, and when it vanished, a man wearing the clothes of a dark wizard emerges, carrying a paper bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the left, a portal of fire opens, and out of it emerges, a ten foot tall red demon, with black horns, with a smaller five foot tall demon, with similar features, next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey James,\u201d John said, looking at the wizard. \u201cAre you here to deliver Julia her lunch? I forgot to grab it on our way out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a problem John,\u201d the wizard said, lifting the bag. \u201cI had gotten it when I heard the call.\u201d The wizard then used a teleportation spell to send the bag to a young girl near the front of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the demon said, \u201cHey John, your sister wants to know if we can enroll Junior in this school. He won\u2019t behave in the one we have in Hell.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing Steve,\u201d John said. \u201cI had a feeling he\u2019d take after his mother when it came to paying attention and following the rules. She always did, because I had to get her out of many situations while we were in school.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks John. I owe you one,\u201d the demon said. \u201cBy the way, I heard the summons, just as I was about to make a trip here. Is there some sort of trouble?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was about to ask the same thing,\u201d the wizard said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing too serious,\u201d John said, with a chuckle. \u201cMe and the others were discussing as to whether or not I should be principal of this school, when that slave-catcher over there showed up, claiming that I am nothing more than an outlaw slave. Can you believe the nerve of some people? I mean, here I am, going about my job, seeing as to whether or not I would be fit to be a principal, when a little cockroach like him shows up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant me to roast him?\u201d the demon asked, a fireball forming in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I could always use another test subject,\u201d the wizard said, getting a wand out of his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I could use a good meal,\u201d a feminine voice said, coming from the wizard\u2019s shirt\u2019s collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to see you to Clara,\u201d John said, with a smile. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t think any of that stuff is needed, right, buddy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then faced the slave-catcher, shifted into his werewolf form, and grew until his head touched the glass ceiling, which was seventy feet above the stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the mouth of the slaver dropped, and his skin turned pale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all sir,\u201d the man said, walking backwards, forcing himself to smile, widely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he ran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, get him you three,\u201d John said. \u201cI want to know why he came after me. When you catch him, take him to my place. Besides, I think the Highmans could use a new pleasure toy. They wore the last salesman out the other day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, wizard looked at the demon and said, \u201cRace yah.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLoser buys the winner a drink!\u201d the demon said, jumping into a portal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re on!\u201d the wizard said, vanishing into a cloud of smoke.</span></div></div>",

He was always causing me trouble,\u201d John said, with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, where were we?\u201d he said, looking back at the audience. \u201cAh, yes. Reasons as to why I shouldn\u2019t be a principal. Now, excluding that slaver\u2019s claim, and the excitement that showed up after, are there any other concerns, or reasons as to why I shouldn\u2019t be principal?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, are you going to get rid of the hunting courses?\u201d said a large, and powerful, werewolf, who was one of the hunting instructors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr the Sexual Education courses?\u201d asked a very attractive female were-fox, who was one of the sexual education teachers, who then laid a kiss on the werewolf\u2019s cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good questions,\u201d John said. \u201cThe answer of course is\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, John paused, causing everyone to lean forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, I thought that, as a vegetarian, you would want to get rid of my hunting classes,\u201d the werewolf said, bewildered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd given how you never seem to appreciate my course, and all that it entails, a person like you would want to be rid of that as well,\u201d the were-fox said, also puzzled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just smiled and said, \u201cWell to be honest, I know that it is necessary for carnivores to know how to hunt effectively, and for people to be educated in sexual matters. I should know, I use the skills I learned to hunt animals near my place, and Janelle and I recently did the other, some time back. However, there are some limitations that I will impose on those courses. Of course, I will talk to you two, as well as any of the other teachers that have any concerns concerning their classes, after this meeting is over, at my office. Now, are there any other concerns or objections?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about disciplining problem students?\u201d An elderly sounding female voice, coming from the roof, said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked up and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Janus,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that you retired.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd miss seeing how you run the school?\" Janus said, with a chuckle. \"You can\u2019t keep me away from that, not for long.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the elderly harpy swooped down, and took a seat near Tawna and Justian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d John said. \u201cJanus brings up a good point. How will you discipline problematic students, given how I feel about the use of certain punishments? Well, first off, when you have a problem student, and you are at your wits end, take that student, and take him, or her, to my office and talk to me about the problems that you have. If the problem is something like tardiness or poor grades, we\u2019ll see what sort of help there is to offer them, like tutors and the like. If the problem is something more serious, like fighting in the classroom, threatening, or endangering others, well, just because Janelle has tamed me down, somewhat, that doesn\u2019t mean that I can\u2019t be a cold hearted bastard when I need to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John just gave an evil smile and laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter all, I have a wizard friend who could always use a volunteer, some giant friends of mine could use a new pleasure toy, every so often, and, a nephew of mine could always wish for a new pet,\" he said, causing many of the more troublesome students, especially ones that he concidered trouble makers, to become nervous. \"And of course, there is always spending some quality time with me. I know that there are two former problematic students that turned out quite nicely under my personal tutelage, or should I say, three?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the door opened, and in came Samual Redblood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you\u2019re late to school,\u201d John said, with a knowing smile. \u201cDid it take you a while to get something to eat?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d Samual said, panting for breath. \u201cThose deer of yours, they are a little hard to catch.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d John said. \u201cA lot more challenging than hunting down a human.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, it\u2019s a whole lot more,\u201d Samual said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long did it take you to catch one?\u201d John asked, as he took a quick glance at the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI kind of lost track,\" Samual said, still panting. \"Maybe three hours before the one I was chasing broke its leg and I could feed on it. However, you seem to have some rather large bears on your land. One chased me away from it before I could even take a sip.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\" John said. \"Perhaps I can offer you a cup to tie you over.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Samual said, as John rolled up one of his sleeves, and waited, as Samual bit down and feed off of some of his blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks again,\u201d Samual said, as he took his mouth off the spot, and wiped his lips of any remaining blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem Samual,\u201d John said. \u201cJust remember what I told you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, whatever, vegetarian,\u201d Samual said, giving him a sly smile, as he walked off of the stage, and mingled with the audience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can clearly see,\u201d John said, grabbing some tape and tissues, to put them on the bite. \u201cUnder my tutelage, even the most difficult of students will see things in a different way, and won\u2019t be nearly as much of a problem in the future.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is it that you managed to get Samual there to behave?\u201d a dragon asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had always had problems with Samual, and had almost threatened to roast him once, except he was afraid of retaliation from the Redbloods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Jake,\u201d John said. \u201cThe best way I can describe it is that I gave him, and the other two students, a bit of a moral dilemma. With the first two, they didn\u2019t really have any arrogance in them, so making them figure out what it meant, was a little bit easier. With Samual though, I\u2019ll admit that I had my work cut out for me. His fear of me, especially after a certain incident, was what kept him in control, at first. However, I needed him to not fear me, so he could properly think about what it was that I was telling him, so, I asked a wizard friend of mine to help me out. Needless to say, I won\u2019t discuss his methods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, I had been planning to make him see the ghosts that followed him, as there were many of them. However, his uncle showed up and complicated things a bit, but, he also sped things up as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because of him, Samual had to face the ghosts of those his family had murdered over the years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He also saw just how selfish his family was, how greedy, how manipulative, how corrupt, every single thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He saw the reasons as to why I fought his uncle, and the reasons that he fought me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He also saw how merciful I was to his uncle, after I paralyzed the man from the neck down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He also knows that, while I do control the main branch of his family, as well as those who are my blood relatives, I am not that bad of a person to listen to, or to come to for advice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then again, I have seen more things than most ever do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have seen those who try to be as peaceful, and helpful as possible, I have seen great cruelties, in all races, including humans themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know of those out there who would, and do, sell their flesh and blood for money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know of those who, despite their fierce natures, would, and do, adopt those, who are not even of their race, and care for them, as if they were their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know of those who wouldn\u2019t lift a finger to help another who was in danger, and they know the person, except to cause the person suffering themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I also know of those who would risk everything, to save someone, which they don\u2019t even know a thing about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, if wisdom is what one knows, and has seen, heard, felt, smelled, and tasted over the course of ones lifetime, then one might say that I am very wise indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'However, I will say this; there are areas that I do not know a thing about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'For instance, I could give you a list of the methods as to how something like a bird, or a harpy, or a dragon can fly through the air, but I don\u2019t know what it is like to fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can tell you the function of every part in someone\u2019s body, but I can\u2019t tell you why those parts came to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Everyone knows something that the person next to them doesn\u2019t. A werewolf, for instance, can know how tasty raw meat can be; however, he will never know how tasty a raw carrot can be, because, even in his human form, his body is not made to handle vegetation well. A human, on the other hand, could know how tasty a raw carrot can be, but he may never taste raw meat, because his body would have trouble digesting it. Someone, like Mr. Tootall for instance, may be able to see for hundreds of miles, on a clear sunny day, but, it would be very difficult for him to read the handwriting of a small fairy. A fairy, on the other hand, could call a model house that a giant makes a mansion; however, they wouldn\u2019t be able to see more than a few hundred yards, if they were standing on the ground of course. Of course, a fairy can fly higher than any giant can be tall, meaning that they could see further than the tallest of giants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, back to my point, I simply taught Samual a new way of thinking, in which he had to think about each consequence of his actions. In fact, seeing as to how he knew that if he killed someone, for a quick drink, it would cause a ghost to come after him, he went after a non-sentient deer, most likely one on my land. But, even with the fact that he had to retreat from a bear, his hunt was safer than if he went after a human. After all, sentient beings can plan, lead one into a trap, and kill the pursuer. Also, humans are quite powerful in their own right, especially when the adrenaline is flowing. That supposedly weak human, who normally only lifts his briefcase, may, all of a sudden, be strong enough to kill even the strongest of giants. After all, wasn\u2019t Jack \u201cThe Giant Killer\u201d just a normal human who killed well over a dozen rouge giants in his career, without any magic, except for his wits, and a good weapon? Also, there are plenty of humans that have non-human friends who protect them, for one reason or another. And of course, there is always things like the decoy tactic, in which a human, or a weaker non-human, acts as bait for their stronger non-human friend, and a supposed hunter, suddenly becomes the hunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, to get back to what I was saying, I simply showed them better ways of doing things. In fact, during their stay with me, Justian and Tawna more or less did the sorts of things they would have done if they were home, with a few exceptions of course. Under my guidance, they started to see things differently, on the first night even. In fact, they know the reason as to why I am a vegetarian.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Mr. Tootall asked, nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John smiled and said, \u201cWell, if you are afraid of me now, and more so when I am in my combined form, to say that you\u2019d mess you pants when the urge for me to kill takes over me is an understatement. As for actually eating others, well, I bet that you, and every other giant, would get everyone that you could and run as fast as you could to the other side of the country. Also, if you think that this version of me is scary, I know that there are people who would prefer me to be a cold hearted bastard, as oppose to a blood thirsty creature.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you say, blood thirsty?\u201d Mister Tootall asked, with a nervous gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you can take the truth buddy?\u201d John asked, with a wicked smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tootall nodded, nervously, as did everyone else in the room, also nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple, pal,\u201d John said. \u201cThere is nothing quite like the flesh of a screaming sentient being digesting in my stomach, especially that that of a human. Oh, then there is also the act of taking one\u2019s life, holding it in your hands and then crushing it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, virtually everyone leaned back, causing a few people in the back to nearly fall over. It was at this moment, that John saw that everyone, with a few exceptions, were more afraid of him then ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, my friend,\u201d John said. \u201cIs the very reason I am a vegetarian. After all, if I weren\u2019t, then giants three times your size, at the very least, would be on my menu of things that I could eat. Also, given how people of different races rarely work together, in a cohesive force, there would be nothing out there to stop my reign of destruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'However, while I still have the three primal urges, of seeking out a mate, killing my rivals, and eating substantial amounts of food, I am in control. I choose who I want to mate with, I choose whether or not I should kill someone that makes me angry, and I choose what it is that I eat. As my dearly departed father, may he rest in peace, once told me, a person makes his own choices in life, and in turn, those choices make him. I choose not to eat other people for food, I choose to mate with only willing partners, and I choose to kill only if I have to. These choices have affected me as well, as well as those around me. People, for the most part, are safe from the fact that I won\u2019t rape them, kill them, or, and this is the biggest one, eat them. Oh I\u2019ll admit that there have been a few close calls, in which I had, or nearly, lost control of myself, but, it seems that someone is watching out for me and those that I care about. I don\u2019t know if it is an angle who wants to protect the innocent from me, or a demon who wants me to commit evil of my own free will and volition, or what, but, it does seem that someone likes to watch me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John looked at the audience, with a smile, and began to chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, back to the main point of this meeting,\" he said. \"Are there any other reasons as to why I shouldn\u2019t be the principal of this school?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The project was to last the whole year, and any non-human that ate us would be failed, immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Obviously, I saw this to be a good insurance policy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course, I got the place with the most ghosts, one hundred of them. Now, my professor theorized that the more ghosts that a place had, the more money one would spend on the heating bill. Imagine his surprise when I had a lower heating bill than the guy with the control place, which had no ghosts, and the heating bill for everyone else was higher, with the guys with more than fifty ghosts wearing winter clothing during the middle of summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When he asked me why I wasn\u2019t an ice cube, I told him that I didn\u2019t know way, because I never felt the need to adjust the temperature. Well, as it turns out, the reason that I had the lowest heating bill was because I treated the ghosts as if they were people, while everyone else ignored them, until they decided to adjust the thermostat, because the ghosts generated a level of coldness, because they were upset at being ignored, as everyone was told to act as if the ghosts were not even there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'However, I just didn\u2019t like how they seemed to look, as if no one really cared about them. I saw one, who could have been no more than five years old, before she died, crying her eyes out, sitting on my bed. I felt pity for her, so I sat down, and talked to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, after that, I talked with all of them, and got their stories. Given how unhappy many of them were, I did things to cheer them up, like, if it was the date of their birthday, to throw them a party. If one liked porn, well, I smuggled a magazine in. If one liked video games, I bought them video games, and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Needless to say, I passed the class and gave the professor another plausible explanation as to how ghosts could affect the temperature in one\u2019s home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well anyways, John prefers to see others as equals. He also prefers those who see things in the same, or a similar, manner as he does. I\u2019ve seen the way he looks at the rest of you, with hatred and anger, and looks at Julia, and a few of the students, as well as myself, with hope and friendship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My father once told me that the eyes are the windows to one\u2019s soul, and his eyes tell me that he hates unnecessary killings, and that he wants others to work together, as equals, and in real harmony. These eyes show me that he knows real pain, and guilt, sadness, loneliness, and much more. If anything, his eyes are more human than my own.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, one of the teachers chuckled and said, \u201cNo wonder he asked that you take his place. You probably remind him of that girl he cares for. I once heard her say that he was more human than a human was. Of course, this was also after Janelle there called him a monster and slapped him across the face. Of course, the next day, he kissed her, and she kissed him back, and they\u2019ve been doing it ever since. To be honest, I\u2019ve never learned why, or how, they made up so quickly. Well guys, given how passionate his little speech was, I say we let Randy speak for us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, every other teacher nodded as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs John watched the group huddle, he had a feeling of uneasiness in his stomach, because he was worried about what the teachers would say. Normally, in most schools, one had to have been a vice-principal for five years, or a teacher for ten, before being considered being eligible for a principal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he remembered that the last vice-principal had left a month before he had been hired, and Jeff had never bothered to fill the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, given the fact that he had been patrolling the halls for signs of trouble, maybe his promotion to vice-principal was something that validated what he really had been for the last five years, just without the name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he saw the group open up, and out stepped Randy Timberstein, the man who had replaced him. The man was an even weirder oddity than John, or even Mr. Tootall\u2019s \u201chuman, but not human\u201d mother, as he was the son of a werewolf and a neko, a catlike creature, which was similar in build to a rakshasa, like Justian, but more benevolent in nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Randy, while he looked like his father, when the man was in his human form, and had his mother\u2019s eye and hair colors, was not a werewolf or a neko. All that really set him apart from other humans were his eyes, which were green, his hair, which was spotted like a leopard\u2019s fur, as his mother was a leopard-like neko, his longer than average canines, and his diamond hard nails, which could extend up to two inches, which was the length that most werewolves could extend them, in emergencies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if he was about to change into some sort of carnivorous were-creature, but was unable to. He was both a human and a non-human. He was a non-human, due to the things that made him stand out from humans, but he was a human because he couldn\u2019t transform, and was incapable of using magic in any shape or form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy looked at John, and saw a man that everyone feared, but who was trying to make things better for all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy cleared his throat, and said, \u201cJohn Wolfstone, the teachers of Snapjaw Central School have made their decision. We say that you are\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Randy paused, much as John had earlier when he had decided to allow the hunting and sexual education classes to continue, which caused everyone, including John, to lean forward towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuitable to be this school\u2019s principal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, those who had been in John\u2019s morning philosophy class the previous year started cheering and saying things like, \u201cextra credit, here we come\u201d, and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just smiled and said, \u201cThank you for your approval, teachers of Snapjaw Central School. I will do my best to live up to your expectations.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he looked up at the sky and smiled, as if he had caught sight of someone watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you approve of the statue that I had built for you, Jeff,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he chuckled, as if he heard something funny, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Jeff. I\u2019ll take good care of them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a thin ray of light, which was what had caused him to look up, vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell guys,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you heard that or not, but it seems Jeff likes the statue I had built for him, and that he really does want me in charge of this school, so, let\u2019s look at his statue, in his honor.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when John and everyone else looked at the statue, everyone was in shocked, and fear, except for John, who merely said, sarcastically, \u201cThat\u2019s real cute Jeff. Now, get rid of the illusion.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statue of Jeff, which had been sitting at its desk, as if passing judgment upon a student, was now standing at the door, as if he was about to grab someone there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep chuckle is heard, and felt, by everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright John,\u201d said a deep voice, eerily similar to Jeff\u2019s. \u201cI just needed to make sure that these students were paying attention is all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah well next time, do it when they fall asleep in class, not when they are awake,\u201d John said, with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the illusion disappeared and the statue of Jeff was back sitting at its desk, where it had been all along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d John said. \u201cEven in death, it seems that Jeff Snapjaw likes to keep an eye on things. So teachers, if you have a student who wakes up, looking like they\u2019ve just seen a ghost, well, they just might have. Okay students, head to the class that you would be taking now, starting with the back rows first and the front rows last. Also, if your teachers are not there when you get there, behave yourselves. After all, it seems that Mr. Snapjaw is still here, in this very school, which he built, in spirit. Teachers, if you wish to meet with me, I\u2019ll be in my office, which is, also, still the teachers\u2019 lounge. That is all, dismissed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the students began to leave the room, with John, and the teachers that wanted to meet with him, leaving through a side exit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A little while later, John was sitting in a chair in the room that was his office and the teachers\u2019 lounge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of him were the two teachers whose classes he had allowed to continue, as long as they followed his limitations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students of their classes had had to be really careful in how they did their courses, as Mr. Wolfstone tended to hit students, which used hunting methods that would leave one\u2019s prey dead, or injured, when it came to hunting class, or those who just forced themselves upon their fellow classmates, when it came to Sexual Education class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, if they used tactics that left their prey alive, and unharmed, or had sex with a willing partner, John wouldn\u2019t interfere too much, beyond to see what it was that they were doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at them and said, \u201cMr. and Mrs. Blackcoat (as the pair were married). The two of you know that I don\u2019t like your classes too much. I believe that student predation is an inefficient waste of the students that get eaten, as their parents will no longer need to pay for them to come here. As for students that get raped by their classmates, in one form or another, they would be afraid to have sex in the future, which means that they won\u2019t have children that could have come and attended this school. These things would eventually mean that fewer and fewer students would come here, and all of us would be out of a job. However, if you two, and every other teacher, didn\u2019t eat, or rape, the students, even those who cause trouble, or are doing poorly in class, parents would have to keep paying for their kids to attend, and, when those students grow up and have children of their own, those children will attend this school, and so on. Now, I have a few personal questions to ask of you. Jackie, how long have you and Rodger been married?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTen years, next week,\u201d the were-fox said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let me congratulate you two then,\u201d John said. \u201cDo you have any children?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we have four of them,\" the were-fox, Jackie, said, with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One is a werewolf, one is a were-fox, and the third seems to be a combination of both a werewolf and a were-fox,\" the werewolf, Rodger, said. \"As for the fourth, well, he hasn\u2019t done any shifting at all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh ha, so, your youngest could be classified as a human,\" John said, as he looked at the couple. \"Of course, given how the two of you have children, you two must have had sex together.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jackie said. \u201cRodger and I have sex almost every night.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo both of you enjoy it?\u201d John asked with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the pair seemed to blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes,\u201d John said. \u201cHowever, how would the two of you feel if someone, all of a sudden, decided to rape one of you, like say if someone tried to rape you, Jackie?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jackie said. \u201cThough my husband and I would try to kill and eat him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, you would,\" John said, with a nod. \"But, what if someone had beaten your husband, and tied him so tightly, and forced him to watch, in horror, as the man beat you, tied you to the bed, tore your clothes off, and raped you, and left without a trace, not even a scent? I know this much, I would be angry if someone did that to Janelle, maybe even to the point that I might sell something that I hold dear to me, in order to find that person, and kill them. As for Janelle, the shame she would feel, that alone might drive her to commit suicide, which could leave me with nothing to lose really. Also, let\u2019s talk about that child of yours, the one who could be classified as a human. What if, someday, he is walking home from school, and now let the three of us use our imagination, and say that he is a human, even to the point that he can\u2019t extend his fingernails, like Mr. Timberstein can. Let\u2019s say that some unscrupulous person gets it into his head to eat him, and does. How would you feel about the sudden loss of your child, whom you\u2019ve spent so much time caring for, in the hopes that someday, he would grow up, get a job, get married, and have children of his own?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the pair fell silent, with Jackie\u2019s eyes threatening to tear up, and Rodger\u2019s face getting red with anger, and gripping onto the arms of the chair, his claws putting holes in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at them and said, \u201cEvery true parent would do what you are doing now. It doesn\u2019t matter if the child is yours or not, whether the child is yours by adoption, by blood, or just some kid that you are fond of, because there is that small part of them that reminds you of yourself at that age. The moment that you find out that that kid will never be coming home again, you feel an urge to track down the person that took his life and make them suffer for it. I should know, I feel it, every time a student of mine wouldn\u2019t be showing up any more because someone out there murdered him or her. I felt it when I found out that Julia had been raped by the monster who had bought her for his son\u2019s meal. When I found him, I took great pleasure in tearing him to pieces, and killing his friends, who had been trying to rape and/or murder Janelle at the time. I left him alive, so that he would suffer more, though that ended when the scavengers showed up as I was leaving. I even gave them an anonymous donation to keep my name off of their records.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, the reason that you and Janelle have been going out with each other is because you saved her life?\u201d Jackie asked, as she looked at her new boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, if you believe it or not,\" John said, with a smile. \"In fact, when I told Jeff that I had saved his precious treasure, well; to say that he approved of our relationship was an understatement. After all, he may have hated me, but, at the same time, he liked, and respected, me, and knew that I wouldn\u2019t purposely try to harm his child.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Rodger said. \u201cAnd here I thought that I had it rough when I asked Jackie\u2019s step-father if I could marry her. After all, the guy\u2019s a fire-breathing dragon.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well, enough of our personal lives,\" John said, as he clasped his hands. \"Let\u2019s get to talking about how your classes will be run, okay.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>John then got out a briefcase and said, \u201cYou know, I was planning to discuss something like this with Jeff. I knew that he had approved of my idea about no student predation being allowed. The guy said it had helped out the school\u2019s finances because I kept the faculty and staff, as were as the students, from preying on those who came here. He said that I was a good influence for the school. God, I am going to miss that man. I mean there were times that I wanted to rip his head off and shove it up his ass. But, when it came to this school, if someone was threatening it, I\u2019d probably be the first person to be at his side, to protect it, as well as the students. I mean, I truly love teaching them, even if I have to be harsh at times, but I would give up my life for them in a heartbeat, if it would keep them safe from harm.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he sighed, as he got out a couple of sheets of paper and handed one to each of the two teachers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I know that these are a little rough,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they are still well thought out and give plenty of explanations. For instance, Jackie, I will allow all the forms of sexually behavior to be taught, from normal and conventional sex, all the way up to those methods that I personally find a little, disturbing, as long as two things are followed, the first is, the minimal age of the student, or the other that they do it with, is sixteen, and that they have the other\u2019s permission, and if that person changes their mind, to respect it. If you find out that the partner was under sixteen, or raped, fail that student, promptly, and send him or her to me. When the class starts up again, allow them to attend it, but, if they do it again, well, that person just became your personal sex toy, to do whatever you want to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, what if they don\u2019t have sex with someone?\u201d Jackie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in that case,\" John said, with a smile. \"Find out the reason. If it is because they couldn\u2019t find a willing partner, well, if you, and/or your husband, don\u2019t mind, one of you can help them out with that. If it is because of a religious belief, in which they should not have sex before marriage, or something like that, have them do an essay about the ways that one can have sex, and describe them, and that will do, because the point of sexual education is to educate one on sexual practices and methods, and writing a report will show you what they know, although they should list references as to where they got the information.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what about the age and the permission parts?\" Jackie asked. \"What do I do to make sure that the students will listen?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple,\" John said, with a grin. \"Tell them that it is more, pleasurable, when one\u2019s partner is willing, as they are not trying to fight the person off. As for the age, tell them that if they get an underage student pregnant, then it is their personal responsibility to make sure the baby grows to adulthood. If anything, I believe that that last one will make sure that they will listen, if only because of that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what about my class, and how is it that I am to teach them things like rending and tearing their prey to pieces?\u201d Rodger asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s like this Rodger,\" John said \"If you\u2019ve noticed, I don\u2019t interfere when students are using techniques to capture live prey, as it were. While on school grounds, or when hunting those of school age, I will allow those techniques, even those that I personally find even more, disturbing, than some the sexual methods that your wife teachers as part of her class. As for those that involve prey being torn and whatnot, well, let me know ahead of time so that I can arrange a field trip to my land. Trust me when I say that there are more than enough things for them to kill, which are not sentient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'However, they best keep an eye on each other. There are animals out there, which could kill them, if they fail to watch out. Even I, myself, have to watch out for those animals. There have been numerous times that I\u2019ve had to fight wolves or bears that tried to hunt me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'However, hunting a non-sentient animal is both safer, and far more difficult, than hunting a sentient being. One way it is safer is because the animals won\u2019t be trying to lead one into an ambush, at least not on purpose, however, it is more difficult because you\u2019d be competing with animals that kill other creatures, as well as even sentient beings, for food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course, I expect each kill to be turned over to me, so that I can make sure that those who work in the cafeteria will make them into lunches for the next day. Seriously, some of those cooks would be better off as the meal. Why, Jeff himself always suspected them of keeping the best cuts of meat for themselves. I mean, a pig-man wouldn\u2019t eat the stuff that they make, and they will eat anything, including the table that held the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'However, if the students were given good tasting food, for breakfast, lunch, and even an early supper before they left school, it would give them a good reason to not go after their peers as if they were food. After all, if one eats food that has been prepared, as if it was for someone of royalty, and tastes unbelievable, they won\u2019t bother to go after something that costs them more energy to capture and prepare, than it is to wait for a professional chef to serve a meal that tastes better than that person would have anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, let me get this straight,\" Rodger said, as he collected his thoughts. \"You will let my students use live capture techniques on the other students, as long as they use the killing techniques on animals on your land, while at the same time, getting food for the students to eat the next day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I\u2019d just have to let my renters and construction workers that you are there to hunt for the class, as they tend to capture trespassers on my land,\u201d John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do they do to them?\u201d Rodger asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, nothing much, just hand them over to me, and, if they are young, and could learn not to repeat that mistake again, I whip them, and let them go. If it is someone older, with plenty of experience, at breaking and entry, I give them two choices, become a test subject for my wizard friend, or work for me, as a security consultant and tester,\" John said, with a smile. \"The rule is this, if they get out of the house that they test, they tell me any flaws and they get paid extra, if they get caught, well, they have to be a servant of the renter, or renters, of that house, for the week, and do whatever it is that they tell them. About the only things that the renters are not allowed to do to them is to kill or eat them, but everything else goes, and I mean everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course, I may give the workers and renters a few incentives to try and capture your students, so that they will work on their stealth capabilities, but not to worry, they won\u2019t harm them, as those who work or live on my land have to sign a contract stating that they won\u2019t eat other sentient beings, unless they want to get fired or kicked off of my land. Of course, there are some exceptions in which I will allow them to, like if their lives, or those of their loved ones, were in danger. Heck, I even allowed them to eat traveling salesmen and priests that don\u2019t seem to realize that \u2018No\u2019 means \u2018Leave before I decide to eat you\u2019, but they don\u2019t even do that even. If anything, they use them for personal reasons, and the next time that I see that person, they are running away, naked as the day that they were born.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, your proposal is understandable,\u201d Rodger said, after some thinking. \u201cAnd believe it or not, but I find it to be a very acceptable compromise, even though there are some things that need to be worked out further.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s understandable,\u201d John said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I also like the proposal you have for my class as well,\u201d Jackie said. \u201cIf anything, it actually may increase the average grade for the class. Then again, I don\u2019t like to fail students that didn\u2019t have sex for some reason. I mean, it gets a little difficult to keep them after a while, and you won\u2019t let us eat them, especially if they are in your class.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that,\u201d John said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have another proposal, which I\u2019d like you to tell the other teachers about. It is about your pay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the pair began to breathe a little uneasily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you planning to cut our wages?\u201d Rodger asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d John said. \u201cMy proposal is far from it. I may actually increase your pay, as well as that of the other teachers, if they do two things.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what are those?\u201d Jackie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne, they are not to eat the students, for any reason. And two, they are not to rape them either,\u201d John said, holding up two fingers. \u201cNow, if they listen to those two things, they will have a bonus of eight percent added into their paychecks. If they keep it up for the entire year, that bonus becomes a permanent pay raise for them. They don\u2019t follow those guidelines; they will not get a chance to get it again until this time next year. However, and, this one may be a little difficult for many to get, I will also add on an additional eight percent to those that don\u2019t rape, or, as I call it, murder others, even if they don\u2019t come to or work at this school. In fact, I may even add on a little extra here and there, if they protect others from those things.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t that upset people if our teachers started doing that?\u201d Rodger asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John smiled and asked, \u201cHave you been watching the news lately?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Jackie said. \u201cAll that\u2019s been in it is you, your blood relatives, the Redbloods, how you beat them in a fight, and Jeff\u2019s murder.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then you may not have heard,\" John said. \"But I hear that city hall is working on whether or not to pass a new law.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat law is that?\u201d the couple asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019d call it a vegetarian\u2019s dream come true,\" John said, with a smile. \"A no predation allowed law.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by a no predation law?\u201d the pair asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple,\" John said, as he leaned foreward. \"In exchange for lower taxes, people will be encouraged to not prey on others. Those who do, or eat the meat of sentient beings, as opposed to non-sentient ones, will find themselves with higher taxes, to make up for the ones that the other would have paid.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jackie and Rodger\u2019s eyes bulged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d they asked in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yah,\u201d John said. \u201cI saved a bunch of those guys\u2019 relatives, as well as them themselves, last week. Well, one simple economics lesson later, I asked them if they would try to pass something like that into law. Since they are not under the control of a single family any more, they can actually see about doing things that help people out, like this law.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would this law help people out?\u201d the couple asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat child of yours, the one that could be a human, would be able to walk down the streets, heading home from school, and not have to worry about getting eaten,\" John said, giving them something that they could posible relate to. \"That means that eventually, your child will have a job, get married, and have children. Now, wouldn\u2019t you support a law that could make that happen, even though you realized that you might have to give up eating what used to be your favorite food?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jackie and Rodger looked at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t want to pay higher taxes,\u201d Rodger said, scratching his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019d want to make sure that our baby would grow up,\u201d Jackie said, lowering her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the pair said, \u201cYes, we would.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d John said, \u201cThe law won\u2019t make predation illegal, but it will discourage it, if it is passed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch like how most places don\u2019t like it when people have hats on their heads,\u201d Rodger said, with a light smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d John said. \u201cThough, I would appreciate it if you, and the other teachers, made sure that others were not wearing those hats, as it were.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John gave a light chuckle, and smile. \u201cNow, make sure you tell the others, both about the ways the hunting and sexual education classes are to be handled from now on, and about the bonuses that they could get. Take care.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you sir,\u201d Rodger said, getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you as well,\u201d Jackie said, kissing John on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better get going,\u201d John said. \u201cJeff would kill me if he thought that I was cheating on his daughter. Oh, and congratulations on your anniversary next week. I hope that you guys have a lot of fun then.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the pair left, and John laid down to relax for a bit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a day like today, I feel like taking a nap myself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really do love her,\u201d said Julia, who was walking beside John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d John said, leaning a little heavily on a cane James had just given him, causing it to whimper, as if in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanelle looked at it and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, he\u2019s that slave-catcher from earlier.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d John said. \u201cThe little cockroach thought that he could get away from James and Steve. Well, he didn\u2019t. The two were trying to decide between placing him in molten lava or, burning him with the stomach acid of a dragon, when Clara reminded them of my predicament. Well, those two boys got the bright idea to pour an invulnerability potion down his throat, another all over his body, pour the stomach acid of a dragon down his throat, place him in molten lava, and then, turn him into a cane for me. However, even with the potions protecting him, he was still badly burned, both internally and externally. Well let me say this, if he wants to get healed up, and survive, he best hope that I don\u2019t accidently say the words that will turn him back to human, because that would end the spell that is helping him to heal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, he has no choice but to rely on you,\u201d Janelle said, as she shaked her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\" John said, as he looked at her. \"But he made the choice to come after me and the choice to tangle with those two, instead of surrendering. It\u2019s like what my father said, he made his choices, and his choices made him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd those made him into a cane for you,\u201d Janelle said, as she gave him a certain accusing look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s better than what Steve, or James, alone would have done,\" John said. \"Clara though, is the reason he\u2019s still alive, even if he\u2019s stuck as a cane for the next few months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Janelle asked, \u201cSo what was it that you talked to the Blackcoats about?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing much,\u201d John said. \u201cIt was really just about how they were to run their classes from now on.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, just how will they run their classes?\u201d Janelle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t really tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, if your students show up smelly, with their clothing looking as if they had been in a hurry to redress, or something like that, well know this, at least they made it to class. Also, when Mr. Blackcoat starts teaching his students certain hunting methods, they\u2019ll be coming to our place to do that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that John?\u201d Janell asked, with her arms crossed across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the moment they do that, you and I just might decide to try the cafeteria food,\" John said. \"Because that is something that has to change.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John gave Janelle a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a scream is heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John sighed and said, \u201cHold Julia for me. It seems that someone hasn\u2019t been watching the news recently. People should know that this is my town.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John handed Julia and started limping as fast as he could to be where he had heard the scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got there, John saw a twenty foot dragon holding a young boy by his feet, about to drop him into its mouth, when John said, \u201cHey buddy, are you okay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m all right,\u201d said the dragon. \u201cJust let me enjoy my snack first and then I\u2019ll talk to you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, it was the kid that I was talking to,\u201d John said. \u201cAs for you, I\u2019d advise that you place the kid on the ground and let him go.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just who do you think you are to tell me what to do?\u201d the dragon asked, turning around to face him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just smile evilly and said, \u201cYour worst nightmare come to life.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d The dragon laughed. \u201cLike a dragon like me is going to be afraid of a weak and crippled human.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho said that I was a human?\u201d asked John, as he grew a few feet taller than the dragon, and shifted into his werewolf form. \u201cI know that I didn\u2019t. However, know this, that boy is my student, which means, you are about to die, unless you let go, right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Well, That's John's story, for now. Now, now that you have read the whole story, go back to the begining and write the story from the point of another person. I hope that you have enjoyed this story.)</span></div></div>",

He is a very good student and looks up to Mister Wolfstone. Not only the fact that he saves humans but he has saved him from two cases of rape/vore. Just recently a lot of the senior males and females are eyeing him. This worries both Johnny and Mister Wolfstone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You take a sigh, in fact you shouldn\u2019t even be the way you are now, in fact you should be a human but due to some DNA problem, you\u2019re..... different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look at your schedule. First philosophy. \"With mister Wolfstone.\" you say looking at the page. \"Most just call me john.\" says a voice from behind you. You jump 3 feet in the air. You turn around to see a man standing a foot away from your body. \"Oh my, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t mean to startle you!\" he said \"I\u2019m alright. Say can you direct me to room....136.\" you ask \"sure do you have a school map? *pulls out map* we are right here you go this way and up the stairs right here.\" \"Thank you. You said your name was John right.\" \"Yes I was just on my way over to teach.\" you look confused. \"Pardon?\" \"I said I was on my way there to teach.\" he replied. \"B-but I thought only monsters were teachers.\" Now john looks confused, then his expression changes. \"Oh you must be the new kid. Well I\u2019m not a human.\" \"Oh come on you really expect me to believe that.\" \"Yes and I can prove it.\" John took a step back then he started to grow. He started to shift into a wolf thing. This happened until he was 20 feet tall and a full werewolf. \"Oh you\u2019re not human.\" \"Nope.\" he said as he shrank back down. \"Now lets get to class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every one I would like you to meet the human foreign exchange student fro...\" \"Actually sir I\u2019m not human.\" \"Oh really, then care to show the class what you are.\" \"Well I guess but.\" you take a few steps back and start to shift, you sprout wings and grow a beak, your grow feathers. When your done you are a giant thunder bird. You change again this time a T-Rex again you do the same thing with different creatures. Eventually you turn back human and the class is in aw.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, he is not like other monsters, as he will not eat humans, as he is what is known as a vegetarian, someone who will not eat a human just because he could. He is a philosophy teacher at a school, and is one of the harshest teachers that the school has, as he will not hesitate to hit his students, especially those who try to eat or rape others. He is also cold-hearted towards them, and never gives out extra credit, unlike other teachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, underneath all of this, is a man who cares for others, and he will go to great lengths to protect people from harm, even when he doesn't even know them. He could easily be the most powerful, and feared, monster out there, but he chooses to help others out, and tries to befriend them. He also wants his students to see the painful truth that he has seen. He feels the lose of his girlfriend, who was eaten by a monster at the collage that she had gone to, as they had went to separate places. He also struggles with his addiction to human flesh on a daily basis, doing his best to never take life needlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the rules that I'd like my fellow writers to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Only I am allowed to add to the section dealing with John directly. After all, the story for him is on my personal computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you may be someone who knows John, like a fellow teacher, perhaps one who hates or fears him, a student who has him for a teacher, or someone else entirely, like one of those who rents a place from him, or someone he has hired to construct houses for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. If you rent from, or work for John, if you wish to stay on his land, which is a third of the price most landlords charge, and have him sign your paychecks, which are three times the normal wage, you must follow the rules that he has in his contract for both workers and renters, namely the rule stating that they cannot eat someone for non-survival reasons, with the exception of traveling salesmen and priests, especially those  that can't take the hint that \"No\" means \"Leave, or I will add you to my supper tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. If you are a student, or teacher, who tries to eat or rape those who go to John's philosophy class, which is almost all of the students, he will not hesitate to run to you, and beat you to a pulp, to protect his student from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. John Wolfstone turns into MR. Wolfstone, a cold-hearted bastard, when he is teaching his students. His eyes seem to say, \"Don't even mess with me.\" when people see them, along with the rest of his face and personality. He will not hesitate to hit or threaten students who break his rules, which include, \"No cheating, no talking when I'm talking, and No eating of your classmates, Ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, here is a list of things I've made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"90%\" style=\"position:relative;\" class=\"norm\"><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\" width=\"56\" style=\"position:relative;\"><div style=\"position:relative;\"><a rel=\"awardlightbox\" title=\"...
