There are times when you don\u2019t know why you are dating or even putting up with her. If it wasn\u2019t for her good body fitting nicely and how well she gives head, you wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with her. *Sigh* Here. Audrey said. She hands you a shake. The right kind this time. You take it under a cautious eye. Look\u2026\u2026 I know I can be, at SOME times, a bitch\u2026.. She said. Your eyes shoot open from surprise of her admission. Yeah, yeah. Even I can admit it at some point. But you\u2019re my boyfriend. I\u2019m the only one you should be gawking at. Not some two cent cow whose chest are fake as her hair. So, and don\u2019t tell ANY one I said this! \u2026\u2026I\u2019m.....sorry. She said. You must be in a different universe. Audrey. The bitch queen. Just apologized for how she acted. You wanted to shout, but didn\u2019t want to make a scene like earlier. Ok\u2026. Now that\u2019s over with\u2026.. I got a bitch\u2019s head to bite off! She said. Audrey storms off. You finish your shake in one go and toss it into the trash. After that, you get a searing headache. You close your eyes and blackout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the headache subsides and you open your eyes. You look around to see you\u2019re on the ground. As your senses come back to you, you notice that everything is big. You\u2019re wondering what\u2019s going on when the ground starts to violently shake to the sound of clacking heels. You stable yourself as the shaking intensifies. When you feel over, you came face to face with a red high heel. You know those heels anywhere. You look up to see Audrey. \u2026\u2026Did it work? It was suppose to work after a few minutes. If that science geek lied to me\u2026.. She said. Did you just hear that right? Audrey did this to you? He\u2019s not here. Maybe it did work. He shouldn\u2019t be any bigger than my toe. She said. That\u2019s when Audrey looks down.</span></div></div>",

You see barbells, treadmills, bicycles, and so on. You realize you\u2019re in the local gym. You don\u2019t see anyone working out, so it must have just open. Just then, you see someone enter. It\u2019s your girlfriend Kyanna in her workout outfit. You know she loves to be in the gym, but first thing in the morning? You joked with her once that she might as well live here. Ok. Time for an early morning workout! A few reps of sit-ups, crunches, pushups, and treadmill will do for today. She said. Kyanna stretches first then starts to do pushups. Kyanna is sweet as they come. You don't think there is a mean bone in her body. The only time you ever saw her mad was when some redhead gave her a hardass time over the way she did her hair. Other than that time, she's a sweet person. With her so low to the ground, she\u2019ll be able to see you easily. You make your way to her as she does her reps. As you get to her, you wave and jump up and down. Kyanna,doing her pushups, had notice something jumping up and down close to her face. What the? Is that\u2026..</span></div></div>",

If you live through it. You stare wide eyed as Kyanna stands up at her full height. I won\u2019t have filthy pest infesting my gym! She said. Kyanna hovers her sneaker clad foot over you. You run and jump out the way as her foot hits the ground. Hey! Stay still! She said. You get to your feet just as her foot comes down. With all your might, you jump out the way. Damnit! She said. You can\u2019t keep dodging her forever. You\u2019ll run out of energy before she does. When her foot hits the ground again, you jump onto her shoe. Get off my shoe! She said. She shakes her foot violently and knocks you off. You fall off and watch her foot raise into the air. Just die! She said. You roll out the way just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyanna has never come across this before. Her baby boy didn\u2019t like bugs, so she became accustom to crushing them when one got into her house. They all ended up becoming mush under her manicured foot, but this one\u2026.. This one wouldn\u2019t stay still and accept its death. Kyanna wasn\u2019t going to be outdone by something that is no bigger than her toe. Ok, bug. You\u2019re not like the rest of them, but you\u2019re going to end up like them. She said. You know that tone in her voice. She\u2019s serious. And when Kyanna gets serious, things get done. And to her, you\u2019re the thing. Kyanna lifts her foot in the air and you move out the way, but before you could even get to your feet, her foot was already coming down again. You roll out the way and manage to get to your feet. You dodge multiple of her stomps, but it\u2019s like each time she misses you, she gets faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyanna was determined to end you. She pushed herself day in and day out with her exercise routine and she wasn't going to let some insect ruin her self esteem. Even though she wanted to smash you under her shoe, she was getting quite the workout of doing so. She had worked up a little sweat too. You dodge her foot again and quickly get to your feet. After doing all that dodging and rolling, you were out of breath and energy. You were so exhausted that you fell on one knee. Kyanna saw that the bug at her feet wasn\u2019t moving as much and smiled. Run out of gas already? Well you gave me quite a sweat for it, but I think I\u2019ll\u2026\u2026.</span></div></div>",

You balance yourself as the shaking gets more violent. As you fall over, you see the cause of the violent shaking. You\u2019re girlfriend, Lola, in her white panties and bra. You watch in awe as she strides all the way to her living room with her breast bouncing with each step and sits on the sofa to relax. Ahhhhh\u2026\u2026 I need this two week vacation. Just what I need to work out the stress. She said. You need to get her attention. You make your way to her and stop when you get to her freshly painted aqua toes. What to do? Maybe I\u2019ll give him a call. See if he wants to hang out and have some fun together. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to get her to notice you.

In a lucid, wet dream, this would be different. You\u2019d tug one out right now. But since this is actually real, you aren\u2019t excited one bit. You jump out of the way as her foot lands close to you. Damnit. Hold still. She said. As you get to your feet, you see a shadow cast over you. Again, you jump out of the way. You scramble to your feet and run. Oh, no you don\u2019t. She said. Lola comes after you. Before her foot lands on you, you dive under her coach. You take a moment to catch your breath. As you do, you see Lola kneel down and look right at you. You have to come out sooner or later. She said before walking away. You wait a few minutes before peaking out. You don\u2019t see her anywhere, so you creep out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re starting to have second thoughts about this now. You thought Lola was a sweet, nice lady. But when you looked into her eyes a few minutes ago, she looked like an ice cold killer. You could just leave, but the chances of you surviving out there at your current state is minimal. Or you could try again with Lola. If you could make her see you as a person, she won\u2019t have a desire to kill you.

You turn around to see Lola staring right down at you. Now I got you. She said. As she makes her way to you, you fall over from the intense vibration. Nowhere to run now. She said. You get up quickly and jump out of the way before she could crush you. Damnit\u2026. Hold still! She said. As she stomps down again, you jump onto her foot and latch on. Ew! Get off, you pest!! She said.  You are thrown off from the shaking. You slowly regain your senses as you see something coming. You lunge out the way just in time to avoid being killed. You\u2019re only making this worse on yourself! When she stomps down again, you jump on her foot and hold on tightly as she tries to shake you off again. When she stops, you start to claw your way up, but you are suddenly plucked upward and brought to eye level. What kind of insect are you?!

Try running away now. She said as she dropped you. You hit the ground hard and have your sense knocked around. When your sense came back to you, you catch a glimpse of her foot looming over you before she stomps you. You push yourself into a roll to get out of the way just before her foot got to you. Damnit! Why don\u2019t you just die!? She said. Lola pins you with one of her fingers. As you try to squirm free, you see her hand come to you and pulls your legs and arms off. The pain was unbearable; causing you to shout as loud as you could. There. Try running away with no limbs. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe this. You thought Lola was sweet as candy, but this\u2026..it was like she was an entirely different person. All you could do was look up at her smiling victoriously. Go on. Run. I\u2019ll give you a chance. She said. She\u2019s only mocking you. You can do anything at all. Not going to move? *Gasp* You must want to die. Well I\u2019ll be glad to help! She said. Lola raises her foot above you slowly; enjoying the moment. It wasn\u2019t the time, but you had a raging hard on looking at her from this angle. One last chance? \u2026\u2026No? Alright then. She said. Lola descends and rubs her foot all over you. Your boner was getting stiffer as she rub her soft foot all over you. Then she raises it again, holds up her middle finger and stomps you to death. She grinds you into her carpet with a satisfied look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sigh* Finally killed it.

Last night, you had sex with Kyu not once, but four times. The sex is great, but she is insatiable. She even did it with you once when you were asleep. You don\u2019t even know how that was even possible. Slowly, you drag yourself out of bed. Your eyes were hanging low from the lack of sleep. You didn\u2019t have work today, but you had some things to do. You make it to your dresser before just passing back out from lack of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4 hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake back up on the floor. You were going to have to draw a line with Kyu. The sex is great, but there is a limit, even for you. You get back up and notice everything is huge. You wonder why that is. You think you\u2019re just dreaming, but it doesn\u2019t feel like a dream. You pinch yourself and it hurts. That\u2019s when you knew you weren\u2019t dreaming. That\u2019s when your door is open and you see Kyu fly in and she was giant. You take a second to put the situation together. That\u2019s when you figured it out. Things weren\u2019t big, you were small. Hey! Are you in here? Her voice booms. She looks around but doesn\u2019t find you. I guess he left. That leave me all alone. Which means\u2026. She said with a lustful smile. She flies to your bed and grabs your remote and turns it to one of the many porn channels. Ohhh! Hot mamas bang neighbor. My favorite. She said. So that\u2019s why your tv bill has skyrocketed. 5 minutes into the show, Kyu has started to masturbate on your bed. You told her multiple times not to, but she never listens. You just hope she would stop for a few minutes and helps you. With her sexual moans burning into your skull, you climb up the bed sheet and see Kyu vigorously fingering herself. Yes! Yes! Harder, playa! She said. She must be talking about you. Her toes were curled, so you were able to climb up her foot and her leg. Yes! Touch me there! She said. You make it up to her knee and slide down her leg. Faster! Deeper! She said. The word nymph doesn\u2019t even begin to describe her sex drive. Yes! YES! Don\u2019t stop! She said. Kyu threw her head back from her masturbation. You know she was nowhere near close to climax yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reach her midsection, you were thrown down from her rapid movement. You couldn\u2019t get back up, so you had to crawl. Yes! Touch me there! I love it when you touch me there!!! She said. During sex, Kyu loved having you touch her breast. She was squeezing her left breast with her free hand. You got to her bellybutton and took a small breather before continuing. Kyu could feel something moving on her stomach. She didn't bring one of her toys or threaten a pixie to enhance her experience. Kyu stopped to see what was on her stomach and see you. When kyu's giant, green eyes fell onto you, you stop. P\u2026.Playa?! Is that you!? She said. You give her a nervous wave. Oh my god\u2026.. This is\u2026..</span></div></div>",

You wanted to say what you were thinking, but the angry look in her eyes makes you clam up. It\u2019s not like I wasn\u2019t going to help you. I just wanted to finish first, but you were too damn selfish! She said. Kyu looks at you then turns her head. Ugh! I can\u2019t even look at you right now! She said. Kyu gets off your bed. Why should I even help you if you won\u2019t help me? She said. She obviously doesn\u2019t understand the situation you\u2019re in. Or at this point, she just doesn\u2019t care. Nothing? I thought so. You know you\u2019re living the dream of so many guys right now. You should be seeing this as a good thing, but no. All you see is bad situation. She said. Does she know how much of a risk this is? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s something you could do. If you could grow and shrink, then yeah, it\u2019d be good. But you can\u2019t. You said. You were going to say something, but Kyu cuts you off. I don\u2019t want to hear it! She said. It\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t been selfish before. Why is it a problem this time? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe I should just leave you here to fend for yourself. She said. Ok. Now she\u2019s just being emotional. A day or two among the bugs and dirt would teach you some humility. She said.</span></div></div>",

You shake your head in frustration. You knew Kyu could act like a baby sometimes, but not in a situation like this. Maybe this is a good thing. It\u2019ll give her a chance to cool down. But that leaves you alone in your room. Good thing you cleaned it so there wouldn\u2019t be any roaches or spiders around. You jump down and have a look around. You did keep food like chips and small snacks under your bed in case you were too lazy to go to the refrigerator. Climbing up to your bed is no problem. And Kyu did leave the tv on, although it was a porn channel, but it\u2019s not like you watch anything else. So maybe you just might survive until Kyu calms down. So you get to work, and within the hour, you had a perfect set up. Food within reach and all the porn you can watch. Now you just have to wait until Kyu comes back.<br>\r\nThe day goes by smoothly and at night, it\u2019s a little hard to sleep with the moaning coming the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up to the sound of the doorknob turning. When it opens, you see Kyu come hovering in. She looks over to the bed to the tv first and looks on intently. She told you she watched porn in her free time. She starts rubbing her breast, but quickly shook out off her lust. You face palm at what you just saw. She couldn't restrain herself before, but now she does. Oh. Still alive. She said. She sounded a little disappointed. Like she was expecting you to get killed somehow. She makes her way over to you and stares at you. So you're not bug food after all. She said. You open your mouth, but close it when you see that sharp stare. Best if you don't say anything. She said. Kyu grabs you and holds you in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas she calmed down or is still mad?</span></div></div>",

As you\u2019re rubbing your head to sooth the pain, you feel the ground shake. At first, you thought it was sense vertigo, but you see a blue boot land next to you. You wonder what it is until you look up to see it\u2019s Celeste walking on the beach. You wonder why she is so big until the rumbling was caused by her walk. Then it hit you. She wasn\u2019t huge, you are shrunken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to get her attention. You won\u2019t last a day on this beach. Not with the crabs, seagulls, and other things looking for a meal. You run over to her as she works on her ship. I think I finally fix the problem. I should be able to get home now. But\u2026..should I leave him behind? He has been wonderfully kind and his knowledge of his planet is vast. She said. You blush a little at hearing those words. You were a know it all in science. I know! There\u2019s enough room in here for two. I can bring him with me! He showed me his world, I can show him mine. It\u2019s the least I can do. She said. But I have to get clearance from the elders. They\u2026..aren\u2019t welcoming to outsiders. She said. Just before she jump into her ship, you latch onto her leg. Ok. Engines are green, weapons are go, nav system is on. Time to go home. She said. With you as an unknown stowaway, Celeste flies her ship into space. The vastness of space\u2026. I rarely have time to enjoy it. I hope the elders will see he is no danger\u2026.. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb up her leg as she flies the ship to a distant, ice blue planet. You reach up to her shoulder and near her ear. Just as you were about to shout, the ship starts to shake. Entering the atmosphere. Decreasing speed now. She said. With the shaking of the ship, you lose your balance and fall into her lap. I\u2019ll land outside the area. Don\u2019t want to scare anyone. She said. Celeste lands the ship on the hard ice. The ice didn\u2019t give way to the weight of the ship. Ah. Home sweet ice. I wonder how much has changed? It\u2019s been a few years since last been home. She said. As Celeste got out of the ship, you quickly grab hold of the fabric end of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh. The cold winds of Tendricide. Feels good to be home again. She said. While Celeste was enjoying the cold winds of her planet, you were turning into an icicle. The cold winds of Tendrice were 5x colder than the wind on earth. The cold wind numb the feeling in your hands and you lose your grip and fall onto the hard ice. Not only are you freezing, but now you\u2019re in severe pain. With the cold winds chilling your bones, it felt like all your bones were broken. You wanted to call out to Celeste, but the pain and cold winds stole your breath. All you could do was stare up at her magnificent body. There was little light at the time she arrived, but even in low light, she was beautiful. You hoped she would by chance look down and see you. </span></div></div>",

Strange\u2026. You aren\u2019t native to my planet. What are you? She said. With her gloved hand, She pokes you a few times. You couldn\u2019t even feel pain anymore. You weren\u2019t dead yet, but you couldn\u2019t feel pain from being exposed to the wind. Celeste brings her face closer. W\u2026.wait\u2026. You\u2019re not a creature. You\u2019re\u2026..! She said. Celeste eyes widen in fear as she recognized you. You were happy she found you, but you can feel your eyes getting heavy. At least you saw Celeste beautiful face one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you did close your eyes, Celeste had reach for you. H\u2026.His body! Little to no warmth! She said. She had to take action quickly or loss you to the cold. Her village wasn\u2019t far away, but you\u2019d be dead by then. You needed immediate warmth. Celeste quickly removed her glove from her hand and cupped you in her bare hand. Celeste thought it would work, but the heat from her hand wasn\u2019t enough. No! She said. Celeste had compared the winds on her planet to the winds on earth. Even on the coldest day on earth, it wouldn\u2019t compare to a day on her planet. A human would need insulated clothes combined with thermals to survive on her planet. Celeste was racking her brain as how to keep you warm. At this rate, he\u2019s\u2026..! No! I will not accept this outcome! She said determined. She was going to find you warmth, even if it meant any unpleasantries. Keeping you in her pockets weren\u2019t good enough. Her boots were out of the question. You might get warm, but between the hard ice and her walking, you\u2019d splatter. That only left two places. Her undergarments could provide you warmth, but you might get pushed into her womanhood on her way to her village. That only left one place. Her breast. Celeste had double D breast. More than enough to provide you with warmth. Celeste had blushed at the thought. The one person she liked between her breast sent a tingle through her body. But she quickly shocks that off. No! No time for that! She said. She knew this was a life or death situation. Celeste brings you to her breast and puts you deep between them. She could feel your ice-cold body between her breast. Celeste\u2019s kind were use to the cold winds. They are able to retain their body heat no matter how cold it got on the planet. Please\u2026.. Don\u2019t die\u2026. Please\u2026. She said. Celeste starts going to her village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleste moved quickly to her village. Along the way, she was hoping you would be ok. Her thoughts were of you. She heard about how untrusting humans are. She\u2019d expect her first encounter to be hostile, but instead, she met a nice human who didn\u2019t freak out or run from her appearance. Celeste wouldn\u2019t forgive herself if you didn\u2019t make it. She could see her village was not too far away. We\u2019re almost there. Just stay with me some more. She said.</span></div></div>",

After spending all the last night trying to get with many of the girls, you simply find that you struck out with everyone of them. It's disappointing to put in effort on these girl's who you've already banged before, only to fail at taking them to bed another time... but just to truly show the universe hates you, you awaken to the sun glaring into your eyes and a horrible headache causing pain throughout your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This horrible situation would only seem to get worse for you. As you open your eyes you look about, only to find yourself blinded by the direct stream of light blasted onto your body. After your vision adjusts and fades in you get a full chance to take in your surroundings. At first it seems you're in some strange new place. Long rolling hills.. but as you keep looking off into the distance past all the hills.. it all starts to click. the oddly colored ground and sky. The large slit of light instead of a sun. The strange objects that seemed so distant and huge.. this was your room at a much greater scale. Panic sets in. You weren't even sure how this happened to you, or even if you would get an explanation. It took a minute of freaking out then some breathing to steady yourself, reassuring yourself that perhaps Kyu or someone knew what was up, that they could fix you. This calmed you for a moment.. but a new danger seemed to approach. A large booming sound. repeating itself, getting closer. You turn, body shaking as you lay witness to the giant form of your own pet.. the now giant cat girl Momo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Momo walked into the room, a large and bright smile on her face as normal. She opened up her mouth, calling out into the open room <br>\r\n\"Master~! It's morning~! It's time o get up so you can play with Momo~!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 She ended her words with her usual childish giggle, unaware of her tiny master sitting on the bed who stared up at her in awe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Now, you could simply jump down to the floor, and either get noticed quickly, or even sneak away if you'd rather find someone else... this does create the problem where Momo wouldn't notice you at all, doing all sorts of things to you by accident, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Master!! stop playing hide and seek!! Momo doesn't wanna play this game!! I wanan play those other games you always have me play!!\"  The cat girl whined in distress, searching around the room and throwing about all sorts of things in the hopes to find you. This of course brings the other option.. simply wait for her to find you. Of course it was unclear what she would even do to you, but some help was better then no help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Wasting no more time on considering your options you decide to......</span></div></div>",
