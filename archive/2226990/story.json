You are obliged to compete until you either win the prize, or are deemed mentally or physically incapable of continuing.<br>\r\n7.  \"Extras\" will be used during your run.

A buzzer goes off, and from your experience watching the show, you know the game has officially begun.  You notice a small wooden chest placed in the center of the room.  On the left side of the chest is a plastic chair with cameras positioned around it.  On the other side is a similar chair, but this one is occupied by a tightly bound, petite young woman with a blindfold over her eyes and a gag in her mouth.  You can hear her whimpering pathetically, and can see her petite body struggling against the tight bonds, her perky little breasts heaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the far side of the room, a t.v. screen flickers to life with instructions for the first task.  It reads \"Open the box.  You must either sit in the empty chair and use the item inside on yourself until you climax, or use the same item on the occupant of the other chair until she climaxes.  If you use the item on yourself, you may use your free hand to help you climax, but the item must be fully utilized at all times during the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart hammering in your chest, you open the box to reveal a modestly sized vibrating dildo and a small tube of lubricant.</span></div></div>",

Your ashamed to see that you have a half erection at the thought of what you're about to do.  You've used toys on yourself before, but never in front of all these cameras.  You sit down in the chair, your heart racing as you slather lube on the toy, then on your tight asshole.  You position the toy and close your eyes, slowly inserting it.  A muffled whimper escapes your mouth as it pushes past your outer ring and slowly slides home.  <br>\r\nYou click the button on the end of the device and it buzzed to life, making you gasp in pleasure.  Your free hand begins to stroke your erect cock as you slowly piston the toy in and out if your slick boy pussy.  You put the thought of the cameras watching you out of your mind and resolve to enjoy yourself.<br>\r\nYou click the button again, moaning as the vibrations intensify.  A spurt of precum dribbles down your hand as you stroke yourself, edging closer to your orgasm.<br>\r\nYou click the button a third time, and let out a loud, gasping groan as the toy presses against your prostate.  Your body bucks against the toy as you finally spray your hot load into the floor in front of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and withdraw the toy, turning it off, then put your boxers back on.  You blush furiously as you look at the cameras, and can feel lube dribbling down your ass crack.  You look up at the monitor screen and see that it has changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations!

There's no way you're using this thing on yourself in front of all those cameras!  <br>\r\nYou grab the toy and the lube and approach the nude, bound girl.  She stops struggling as she hears you approach, whimpering softly into her gag.  Your cock stirs in your boxers as you look her over.<br>\r\nYou lean in and run a hand across her bare breasts, causing her to recoil in fear.  You feel a pang of guilt for eliciting this kind of reaction from her, but push the feeling to the back of your mind.  She's an extra; she knew what kinds of things would be required of her when she signed up.<br>\r\nYou trace your hand down her smooth, soft body until you reach her tight pussy.  You trace it with one finger, watching her tremble in anticipation.  You withdraw and apply lube to the toy, then place it against her pussy lips.  She lets out a sound not unlike a sob into her gag, and then you push the toy in with one quick motion.<br>\r\nThe woman's back arches and she begins to pull against her bonds again.  You turn the toy to its highest setting and begin to pound her pussy with it.  You can hear her sobbing and moaning into the gag as you work.<br>\r\nSoon, her pussy is soaking wet, and her juices are making the seat of the chair slick.  You feel a tremor of sadistic glee run thru your body, and you pull the toy out for a few moments, waiting until you're sure the woman thinks it's all over before plunging it back in.  You repeat the process several times, until she's crying from under her blindfold.  Her juices are running freely, creating a small drip puddle on the floor.  Finally, you decide she's had enough.<br>\r\nYou force the toy into her faster and harder, her body writhing as she hears climax.  Suddenly, she screams into the gag and squirts, her cum spraying across your hand and onto the floor.  You can't help but laugh as you step back, her exhausted body slumping into the chair as she sobs quietly.  <br>\r\nYou leave her there, sitting in the puddle of her own juices, and look up at the monitor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations!  You've completed your task!  Please choose a door to proceed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the far end of the room, a red door, blue door and green door illuminate.</span></div></div>",

As anarchy began to take hold, it was decided that a new form of entertainment was needed to calm and placate the populace.  Thus, Doors of Fate was born. <br>\r\nThis dark, twisted and highly pornographic game show puts contestants into situations that test their fortitude and sanity.  The prize for winning is a free ride for the rest of your life; living in absolute comfort while the rest of the world drowns in misery.  This new age blood sport also employs \"extras\", people who, for a reasonable paycheck, have given their bodies and minds to the show's creators to be used in any way necessary.<br>\r\nWill you be able to beat this twisted form of entertainment and earn your life of luxury?  Or will it consume your soul and your sanity?</td>",
