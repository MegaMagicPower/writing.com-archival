It was like this for most of the time you had been in the force. Your father had been a police officer, so of course when you got older that's what you wanted to do.  You always wonder if you were destined for greater things in life. However just as you contemplate these thoughts you soon get a call over the radio that all units are needed to the UNL campus immediately. You quickly begin to turn on your squad car and begin heading toward a nearby off ramp into the city. As you get closer to the city center, you start to notice smoke plumes rise from all across town. Getting to an intersection, you watch as 3 S.W.A.T. vans speed past, as the do you pull in behind them and follow as more squad cars follow as well. Upon arriving near the campus you proceed to put you car in park and get out. As you get out you watch as S.W.A.T. teams as well as a few riot units begin dismounting their vans. You now also begin to hear gun fire ringing out at the campus and city. You spot the Sheriff and run up and ask whats the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chemical Leak on the campus, we need all units here to help contain the students.\" he finishes before running forward to brief more officers on the situation. What do the students have to do with a chemical leak? You begin to wonder, looking back to this morning you had seen news reports of similar Chemical leaks across the US, you wonder if they had anything in common. Soon you become detracted by near by gun shots, as you turn to inspect the source, you gun drawn. You spot two officers running out of a near by school building, firing rounds behind them. This all didn't make sense, and even less at what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You watch as a cougar and wolf come running out and tackling the officers. However these were no normal animals, that looked half animal and half human. They seemed to walk upright and had a figure of a normal human, but now were covered in fur and had many feature of their respective animals. They also had remains of clothing on them as well. You watch as the two officers are mulled in front of you. Hearing more commotion you look around and see more half human animals running out of the campus attack police forces. They ranged in types of animals and sizes. To detracted you soon hear a loud growl near you. Looking behind you see the wolf hybrid from earlier running at you ready to attack. Thinking fast you quickly fire a round into its leg forcing it to the ground in pain. You see more of these things are begin to notice you. Thinking fast you quickly jump back into your squad car and begin pulling away. As you begin to drive away suddenly you end up hitting something or someone. Peering out the side window you see what looks like a deer like human think laying on the ground quickly struggling to get back up and continuing to run away. You don't know what the hell is going on, but you.</span></div></div>",

You thought it best not to leave her behind since you had enjoyed having her, plus she could also help carry the load of your bags. Grabbing a saddle you take her out of the barn and begin rigging her up to go. After a few minutes of prep you manage to load your bags and rifle onto her. Patting her contently you, quickly run over to your squad car and open the trunk and take out the mossenberg shotgun inside and sling it onto your back. Walking back over to Lynda, you swiftly mange to mount onto the saddle and begin to lead you and her away from the farm and off into the wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... 2 weeks later ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, shit didn't get any better, it got worse, way worse. The entire country was under a national emergency. These anthro animals as people had started to call them, were the result of some kind of virus experimentation done by the US government. Turns out some of the samples they had got mixed up and sent to universities across the nation. There it quickly spreed into the local population, turning people into animal human hybrids, melding their minds as well. Luckily it looked that a good chunk of the population is immune to the virus, though that didn't stop the anthros from reeking havoc and chaos with their new forms. You had heard that some of these anthros still acted like their normal selves, while others embraced their animal nature. Though you were still not willing to try and meet one up close, after what happened on the campus 2 weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CRACK!!\", the loud sound of thunder could be head overhead, as you calmly rode your horse through the wooded mountains where you now called home. You had managed to survive of the land well enough, and you still had some rations left as well. Lynda to awhile to get adjusted to her new life here as well. Though with it getting closer to winter, you worried about how hard it was going to be to continue to stay out here. Stopping for a break you get off Lynda and lead her to a nearby stream for water. As you sit down and rest you watch the storm clouds rolling over the distant mountains, lightning occasionally striking the ground. Looking back over to Lynda drinking the water, you can help but notice something looks off about the water. Looking over a bit closer you spot weird coloration in the water. As your about to pull her away you soon hear a massive roar behind you and a chuckle?! Spinning around quickly you spot a massive bear, though this isn't your normal grizzly, no it looked like it was....anthro...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck! you curse under your breath as the bear walks closer laughing . \"Well well well, look what we have here, some fresh meat. You look like the perfect size to fill me up for the winter!\" It says in a low growly voice. The bear begins to run at you, though you manage to dodge and begin to run over the Lynda, who still had your shotgun strapped on her. Running to pull it out, you startle her as you begin to struggle to pull out your gun. As you almost free the gun a large shadow forms over you, looking behind you and Lynda are quickly tossed by the massive bear. As Lynda falls into the stream. You find yourself up against a nearby tree, and see the bear begin to lick his lips as he moves over towards you growling. As he moves closer towards you, you see the shotgun laying right next to you. As the bear gets ready to begin tearing you apart, you manage to grab and raise the shotgun at him, firing 4 shots in quick succession, you watch the bear anthro topple over. Getting up and rubbing your back you move closer and see the bear anthro is no longer moving or breathing. Sighing in re-leaf over the ordeal you quickly remember about Lynda. Going to the stream, you see her moving out of the water, as you run up and check on her. Everything seems to befine, tho she does look a bit tired from the ordeal as well. Rubbing her mane, you begin to walk back towards your camp nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the camp, the sun begins to sink behind the mountains. Seeing this you begin to start the campfire and settle Lynda down for the night. After eating a can of heated baked beans you decide to turn in for the night, and slump up in a near by alcove in the mountain side...</span></div></div>",

Instead of you horse laying on the ground was what looked to be a human horse hybrid. It had the figure, hands and feet of a human, but its head shared a similar shape and features of a horses mixed with some of that of a humans facial features. It also looked to have long hair and as well a tail sticking out of it. though the most shocking part of it was it shared the same brown/white fur color and black mane color as did Lynda. Not to mention the figure looked very feminine and was way larger than you were. You mind slowly begins to try and comprehend that you horse now looked like the anthros you had seen before. Think back you realize the color you saw in the water must be why she changed and may also be why there was the massive anthro bear from yesterday! However as you continue to inspect the laying figure in front of you, she begins to slowly move and awaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her eyes open, noticing they look bigger and more human like. You hear her yawn and neigh at the same time as she begins to lift her form of the ground. You freeze as your horse look up and stare you in the face, not knowing what was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, master\" you hear Lynda say to you in a nonchalant manner, as she gets up see begins to notice her changes and show a look of shock as well. \"Wha.. What happened to me?\" she says as she begins to inspect her hand and new body. As she inspects you only have one though on your mind. HOLY S*&amp;% MY HORSE IS FUCKING TALKING!!! Internally you a freaking out. However you notice Lynda is now looking at you in worry. \"Don't worry master, its me your favorite mare, don't you recognize me?\" Still in shock you stand an carefully move closer, keeping eye contact with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha..,why, how....\" you mumble under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but please know that I'm not going to hurt you...\" She says worryingly towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell this morning just go a whole lot more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...15 Minutes Later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after a long talk, with.... you horse, you begin to settle down. As far as you and her could figure out the virus or what ever, must have infected the local water supplies and must effect normal animals as well. Standing there, you continue to stare awkwardly at Lynda unsure what to do next. See then decide to stand all the way up and soon you get a good idea of her size. You being close to 6' tall, she towered over you at least at double you height. With her standing you begin to notice that she has the frame of a supermodel, which just make this more awkward. Looking away, she questions you whats wrong. You then explain to her about here being naked and courtesy and what not, which causes her to blush and quickly try and cover her areas with her arms. Trying to make this less awkward you, go to you bag and pull out one of your larger t-shirts and nylon shorts and hand them to her. After a minute of struggling and manipulation she manages to put on the shirt and pants, though the shirts arms are torn to shreds and the bottom of the shirt only goes to right below her chest; and the shorts are stretched to their max, looking more like booty shorts. At least it was better than nothing. We now here you were in the woods, now with you anthro horse, who was twice your size. You..</span></div></div>",

Making up your mind, you begin to pack up you items scattered around you. After filling your bag with your belongings, you look up towards Lynda. You see her sitting on the ground, still inspecting her new anthro form and the new assets it come with. With her sitting down she still had a good foot over you in height. Slinging your bag over your back, you walk over towards Lynda, who soon notices you walking towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello master, where are we off to now?\" She asks with a bit of excitement in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're heading back towards civilization. Have a bad feeling this coming winter is not going to be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Well what ever say master!\" See responded, though you were beginning to find it awkward of her to call you master, again must be some remnants of her animal mindset of being you horse. Seeing that your ready to go, Lynda proceeds to stand up and begins to look around confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuhh, so how are you going to ride on me now? Don't really feel comfortable moving on all fours anymore..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess we'll just walk together then.\" You say. After saying this you help Lynda get the rest of the supplies. Luckily she was still big enough to easily carry the two duffel bags on her back. You though of lending her one of your guns, though decided against it as her hands were a bit too big to fit the triggers and you also still felt a tiny bit nervous of her now that see was a anthro twice your size. Soon you both begin walking, head down and out of the mountains back towards your farm. As you continue to walk, Lynda looks down at you seeing you burden with carrying your rifle, shotgun, and pistol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, you sure, you don't want me to carry any of your weapons? I can easily do so for you?\" She says looking down at you with concern on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, its find Lynda, Rather have them on me encase we run into something like yesterday.\" You say, sowing a bit of exhaustion in your voice,\"And by the way, you don't have to keep calling me 'Master' Lynda, just Tim...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Mas... Tim, if you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough out the day you make good progress down the mountain, you start to see basic signs of civilization, roads, signs, power lines. You</span></div></div>",

You squad car still parked in front of your house, and as far as you could see, no obvious sign of break in. As you begin to cross the field, you start to see snow begin to fall from the gray skies above. Even with your jacket and warm clothing you brought with you it still felt freezing. Looking at Lynda, you see that the cold has little effect on her, even with her minimum amount of clothing you gave her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making it to the house, you begin to unload all your things into your living room. Checking your lights you confirm that there is no power at all. Needing some warmth you collect some firewood that you had stashed outside your home for your fireplace in your living room. After a few minutes you manage to light the fireplace and warm up a bit, though it still fells a bit chilly. Finishing setting your stuff back up in your home, you walk back outside to find Lynda inspecting the barn. She almost bumps her head on the large door frame going inside. From where you could see and memory, she would have a hard time getting comfortable in the barn. As she walks back out she sees you and quickly walks over to you and bends down to talk to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright Tim?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, though its a bit cold, everything is fine, just though to check up with you before I head in and call it a night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah i'm fine. Still find this new body so strange, and weird being so bigger than you.\" You both chuckle at those remarks, before you begin to slowly walk back inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll good night Lynda, Let me know if you need anything...\" you say as you walk in. However before you are halfway through the door, you here the porch creak behind you. Looking back you find Lynda bended down supporting herself with her hands pressed on the porch roof, looking at you with a bit of nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Tim, I saw you were cold and were wondering if maybe....\" she says nervously, \"I could sleep with you tonight in the house... Since its so cold out I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, now your horse turned anthro, was now asking if she could sleep with you, You didn't know if this day could have been anymore weirder. Though she had acted nice towards you all day and still showed loyalty towards you, plus she didn't look half bad....what the hell were you thinking, but, no.....mmm you..</span></div></div>",

You had gained a bit more trust with how shes handled turning into anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK...Sure...\" You nervously say before you are suddenly grabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH THANK YOU MASTER..... Oh Tim, sorry!\" Lynda gleefully yells as she picks you up and pulls you into a tight embrace. Well she defiantly still had the muscle of a horse as you began to feel a bit crushed. After a few seconds, she looks down and notices you struggling to breath and quickly sets you back down and begins to apologies profusely towards you. Getting your breath back you begin to lead her inside. The first obstetrical faced is the door, turning around you see Lynda inspect the doorway meant for people half her size. You watch as she bends down to her knees and begins to push and squeeze herself into the house, her amazonian frame not helping her fit smoothly through the door frame. After a minute she manages to get herself all the way through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house, Lynda is forced to stay crouched, not able to stand at her full height. You awkwardly tell her to make herself at home as she begins to inspect your house and rooms. You show her to the living room with the burning fireplace, as you quickly go into the kitchen to grab a drink. Leaving her be you walk into the kitchen and pull out your canteen and take a sip, looking out the windows at the falling snow. Suddenly you begin to hear commotion and a loud crash sound back in the living room. Quickly putting down the drink you dash to the living to see what the commotion is. Getting there you see Lynda has defiantly tried to make herself at home in your living room. She looked to have inadvertently pushed you furniture around trying to move around. She also looked to have taken a liking to your favorite couch. You watch as she begins to shift her large form onto the couch behind her. Plopping down onto it causes it to strain, right before just completely breaking under her heavy weight. Surprised by the couch collapsing, Lynda jumps a bit, before looking over her shoulder and spotting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He He, Sorry.....\" she says embarrassingly towards you. Rubbing your head, you begin to walk towards the fireplace. Inspecting it to make sure that its still burning well. After ensuring the fire won't go out anytime tonight, you turn around to look for a resting spot in the room. Looking around you see that its in disarray and not many options for places to sit and rest. You see Lynda is still laying on the remains of your couch facing towards you and the fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about your furniture, kind of accidentally bumped into some of it. Hope your not to upset...\" Lynda says in a worrying tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no its fine. You can't help it, plus it was my decision to let you come inside anyways...\" you say looking around for a place to sit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, If you need a place to rest, you could lay right here next to me? So you also have me to keep you warm..if you want, I mean.\" Lynda says casually. Well looks like you were out of options, as well as a little part of you did want to lay next to Lynda. Walking over you manage to lift some pillows around and sit down in front of Lynda. You kind of were forced on the floor, since all the couch was taken and broken under Lynda's body. Sitting down, you lay back and end of leaning onto Lynda stomach. Her fur did warm you up a bit and felt nice as you began to relax. Looking around you still can't believe that you were doing this, she was still your normal horse a day ago, now a large amazonian horse anthro! It didn't help that she had G size breast and a nice figure to her new form. The more you though about it, the more and more you began to have lewd feeling for Lynda, Though you tried to push them back into the rest of your mind. Looking to your right you see Lynda just calmly breathing and starring into the fireplace as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you begin to drift to sleep. Before fully doing so you manage to tell Lynda goodnight. As you do so, you soon find yourself wrapped by one of arms, as she began to hug you slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight to you to Tim, and thanks for trusting me...\" Lynda says softly as you both slowly begin to drift to sleep in front of the fire as snow gently falls outside.</span></div></div>",

You think back to three months ago, when this all started, you were a buck sergeant in the Army, only one year out of Ranger school. You had been stationed at a Nation Guard base out in Illinois to help train some of the guardsmen, one day you got a call to help evacuate part Chicago, they said it was a chemical spill, but there weren't any type of chemical plants in that part of the city, but they still made you wear protective gear anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your unit got set up, evacuation went smoothly....at least for the first six hours, then panic suddenly erupted and thats when you saw the first ones. The first creature you saw had tackled someone and was about to attack them if two guardsmen hadn't dropped it first. At first glance you thought the creature was just some lion that had escaped from the zoo during all this confusion, but you noticed this animal had distinctive human features like, hands, and wore some articles of clothing, but was covered from head to toe in fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you saw them all, hidden in the dark were multiple sets of glowing eyes, staring at you and then at their fallen comrade, then back at you.

You felt a tingle of fear creep down your spine, \"Gunny!\" you yell down the hall followed by sounds of people running toward you, you take your eyes off the male and see Aaron, Joshua and Robert running towards you followed by the two scientists, you point into the room, he looks in opens the door more, to your surprise you spot at least ten more people, all acting the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron looks back at the scientist with the lab coast, \"what's wrong with them?\" he asks, \"<i>It</i> did this\" he says, \"ok we'll do this the hard way\" Aaron says to himself as he walks toward the scientist, he grabs him by his coat and slams him into the wall. \"No more 'it' did this, 'it' did that, tell me what happened here NOW!\" he orders.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of talking the room finally goes quiet, \"ok so let me just recap, you guys captured a one of these creatures and brought it here to study\" says Robert, the scientist in the lab coat named Richard, nodded. \"But you underestimated its...um...um mind powers\" you struggle to remember what Richard said, \"psychic abilities\" Richard corrected, \"right, anyway it managed to escape, but you confined it in the building that we almost entered\" you continue. Again, Richard nodded, you sigh and lean back in your seat, rereading the file that Richard gave each of you, it was only a partial file as the rest of the research was lock next door with the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the folder was a transcript version of the video logs on the day the anthro creature escaped its confinement,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>(Star of Transcript)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVideo log number 21:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject has shown a great fear of being returned into solitary confinement, on that note, subject's food and water intake take a dramatic turn when isolated or threatened with isolation. Subject's anatomy consists of---wait a minute....WE HAVE A CONTAINMENT BREACH, I REPEAT WE HAVE A-----------<br>\r\n(End of Transcript)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set the file back on the table and rub your eyes, \"not much to go on\" you say to yourself. \"Why don't you go get some sleep\" says Joshua, looking up from his folder, you nod and leave the room to the small single make-shift bedroom for some sleep.......</span></div></div>",

Your eyes adjusted to the light and you could make out Joshua standing there with a flashlight and his sidearm pointed at you. As soon as he saw it was you he quickly lowered his gun, \"Jeez dude, I almost shot you\" he says, \"what are you doing out here?\" you ask. \"I heard whispering outside my door\" he says, \"same\" you say, just then you hear the sound of giggling coming from the other end of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Joshua aim down the hallway, \"the hell was that?\" says Joshua in a confused and afraid voice, the two of you slowly make your way down the hallway.

Aaron looks over his shoulder and spots you and Joshua with your sidearms drawn, \"yeah we're fine, are you?\" he asks cautiously, \"yeah its just that......we heard--\" \"Voices?\" Robert interrupted you. \"Yeah\" Joshua says, the four of you go over what has happened so far and one thing is clear, something was trying to draw you towards the second building..........</span></div></div>",

The whole time the conversation was going on you saw Robert and Joshua looking at Alese and then at you and then back at her, trying to figure out what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok how do we get Richard?\" you finally ask after the last of the coldness left you, \"All his 'soldiers' are out looking for me in another part of the building, so for the most part they shouldn't be a problem.\" says Alese \"So what, we're just going to walk right in there?\" asks Joshua, \"pretty simple right?\" she says, \"how do you know where to go?\" you ask, she turns and looks at you, \"I can read minds remember?\" she says to you with a smile. \"Alright lets get moving, we might not have long before they realize we're not where we're supposed to be\" says Aaron, The four of you grab body armor, ammo and an M240B each before setting out for Richard's office.......</span></div></div>",

Aaron tightened his girp on the trigger, \"or this one?\" he asks, pointing at Joshua, \"or maybe this one?\" Richard says as he point the gun at you, Allie visibly flinched, which Richard noticed, \"ah so its this one\" he says with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you care?\" Allie says, \"well its the final part of my project\" he says, \"what project?\" Aaron asks, \"In case you haven't noticed Sergeant, humanity is nearing extinction, but the completion of this project will put a end to that\" he says, \"you know what, I'm getting sick of hearing your voice, Allie, help me out here\" you say, suddenly Richards face is smashed into his desk by an invisible hand, knocking him out.

You sigh as you look at her, she stared at you with tear soaked, puppy eyes, \"ok I trust you, but no more leaving out the tiny details again ok?\" you say, setting you hands on her shoulders, she nods and surprises you with one of her hugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you head outside where everyone else was waiting for the choppers to arrive, \"hey sarge, I have to take off on you\" you say to Aaron. He looks at you confused, you point your thumb at Allie, \"some unfinished business\" you say, \"does this have to do with the whole 'possession thing' that happened in the armory?\" he asks, you nod. Joshua hears you and walks over, \"why don't you stay with us, I'm sure our people could help you\" he suggests, \"yeah and once they found out a human and an anthro shared the same body or whatever, then I would be the one in the cell, being experimented on, and we'd be back where we started\" you tell him. \"Ok then I guess we'll be seeing you around then huh?\" says Aaron, \"I guess so\" you say, shaking his hand, \"here, this is the best way to get in contact with me if you need to\" he says, handing you a piece of paper with map coordinates and radio frequency numbers on it. He turns to Allie, \"you know, you not that bad I guess\" he says, holding out his hand, she smiles and shakes his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you say your goodbyes and leave before the BlackHawks arrived, \"so where exactly are we going?\" you ask, \"a friend of mine, he knows how to reverse this\" she says. The two of you walk in complete silence for a little more that three hours before you decide to break the ice again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Question\" you say, \"since we technically share souls, does that make us soul mates?\" you ask, Allie looked at you and though about if for a second, \"Umm...yeah I guess it does, doesn't it\" she says with a small grin. Soon the  two of you find an abandon house and decide it was best to stop for the night as it was starting to get dark out. As you start setting up a bed for the two of you to sleep in, you notice Allie had disappeared and after a quick search you found her on the roof, staring at the stars, you carefully climb out and sit next to her, \"I'm sorry, its just that I've been locked away so long I sort of forgot how beautiful this is\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you stay out of the roof for a little over four hours at which point you notice Allie had fallen asleep, leaning on you, you run your hand up and down her back, causing her tails to wrap around you.

She looked back at you with tear soaked eyes, \"you really mean it?\" she says, you reach up and wipe away her tears, \"of course I do\" you say, she leans in and gives you the sweetest kiss of your life, time seemed to grind to a halt, minutes seemed to turned to hours and before you knew it you lost track of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she breaks the kiss and rest her head aganst your chest, her tails wrapping lovingly around you, \"I guess we don't need to go see my friend do we\" she says, \"we can still visit him if you want, you know give him the good news\" you say, \"later, I'm more concerned as to where we will live that we won't be..uh <i>distracted</i>\" she says. \"Well there is my uncles cabin, he left it to me when he passed, its secluded and no one else besides me and my brother knows where it is\" you say, Allie looks up at you, \"I think thats a great idea, but what about your brother?\" she asks, you sigh, \"ever since this whole thing started, I've been trying to find him, you know to make sure he's ok and all, but I don't know where he is\" you say in a sad voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie nudges you chin with her muzzle, \"I can help you find him, do you have a picture of him?\" she asks, you nod and get up to retrieve his photo out of your vest where you always kept it.

She directs your hands to her hip and impales herself, at first you are hit with a wave of pleasure that almost sent you over the edge, it has been a long time since you had sex with anyone and doing it someone like Allie was much more arousing and exciting. For what felt like hours the two of you continue for most of the night, moaning and panting, switching positions, and finally as if planned, the two of you climax at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both lay back down, panting, the sun started to rise over the horizon, \"I could use a few more minutes of sleep, but I guess its time to get up\" you say. \"I could fix that\" she Allie, with a wave of her paw, the sun disappears back below the horizon, you look at her in shock, \"thats kind of cool\" you chuckle. As you lay down to sleep you feel the skin over your left breast, start to itch, but you ignore it and fall asleep. You are woken up to Allie licking your face like a dog, \"what are you doing\" you ask, \"cleaning you\" she answers, you grab her cheeks lightly and plant a kiss on her nose, \"I think I'm clean enough\" you say letting her go, she smiles at you. Suddenly she stops something on your chest, \"Oh!\" she says in surprise, \"what is is?\" you ask, looking at what she saw. On your chest, right where your heart would be was what looked like a tattoo outline of a five tailed fox that looked just like Allie that was the size of your hand, \"What the...?\" you say. \"Its the seal\" says Allie, \"the seal?\" you ask, \"yes the seal, it marks that you and I are mates, you have gotten your's which means it is only a matter of time before I get mine\" she says excitedly. \"So this seal is sort of like a wedding ring?\" you ask, \"exactly, except it takes time for them to appear, most likely I will have mine by the end of the day today\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a finger and starts 'petting' the fox tattoo, to your complete surprise, the fox symbol responded when Allie touched it, it moved as if it was a real fox. After laying around for a while, playing with your new 'pet' the two of you get cleaned up and dressed, \"So where should we go now?\" Allie asked over an MRE ration breakfast, \"well I want to make sure my brother is ok, but I also want to make sure my cabin is still there so we have a place to go\" you say............</span></div></div>",

She returns wearing a pair of jeans and a t-shirt with a zip up hoodie in her paws, her tails poking out from under the shirt, you look down and see she was barefoot, \"guess they didn't have any shoes that fit her\" you think to yourself.

She nods and starts scanning the surrounding area, after a tense twenty minutes of fighting with the rusted lug nuts, expecting someone or something to sneak up on you, you finally get the tire changed and head out.

The fox's ears were drooped as it looks in the direction that the car drove off, the fox had yet to take notice of you until you started to make your way towards it. The fox spun around and struck a defensive posture and let out a warning growl at you, you made yourself as non-threatening as possible as you approached the fox, \"its ok, I'm not going to hurt you\" you say calmly as you neared the fox. Surprisingly the fox didn't try to bite or attack you in any way as you reached it, it only gave you small growls, you hold out one of your hands for it to smell and while it was distracted you reached for the collar to read the name tag. \"Lets find out your name shall we?\" you say to the fox, inscribed on the heart shaped tag was the name Sara, \"well Sara, would you like to come with me?\" you say to the fox, but the fox gave you another one of its growls. \"Well ok then, I'll be seeing you around then\" you say, giving the fox a small pet on the head and then you get up and walk away, leaving the fox standing there in the road alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter following the road for an hour you spot a farm so you make your way towards it, the front door and windows on the house were completely destroyed so you approach with your weapon raised. You decide to check out the barn first instead of the house, the barn was in better shape than the house. Inside you found the barn to be deserted with no sign of any animal having lived inside, \"ok I think I'll stay here for tonight\" you say to yourself. You turn back and enter the house with more caution than the barn, the front door was laying on the floor inside with claw marks on it, \"I hope whoever lived here got out ok\" you think to yourself. As you search the house you found no signs of a struggle, in fact it looked like a couple anthros broke in and found nobody home and left, you head to the second floor to get blankets so you could sleep in the barn for the night. As you enter a bedroom you hear what sounds like jingling and the sound of claws on wood, you freeze as you listen for the noise again, you peek over the banister at the first floor to try to find the source of the noise. You spot a bushy tail sticking out of the doorway that leads to the kitchen, \"what the...\" you say silently, the tail disappears into the kitchen followed by the jingling noise and the light scratching sound again, suddenly you hear a whimpering sound emanate from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put together everything and suddenly the answer to your question pops in your head, \"Sara?\" you yell, you hear a yip sound come from the kitchen. You climb down the stairs and stand in the doorway to the kitchen, \"Sara\" you say again, a familiar fox head pops around the corner and spots you, you drop to a knee, \"change your mind did ya?\" you say, she runs over and starts licking your face. You reach up with two hands and scratch her behind the ears causing her tail to go wild, \"I guess you're staying with me huh?\" you say to Sara, she responds with a small bark. You resume gathering supplies from the house and moving them into the barn, by the time you got set up in your new home for the night, the sun had started to drop below the horizon so you make dinner with the food you found for you and Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating you lock up the barn from the inside to keep any anthros out during the night, you and Sara head up to the upper loft where you had the pillow and blankets from the house laid out. You climb under the blankets and lay down, just before you drift off to sleep you feel movement under the covers, suddenly Sara's head pops out from the blanket and looks at you. \"Well this is interesting\" you say, she lets out a yawn and lays her head on your arm, \"good night\" you say, brushing her head, soon the two of you were asleep......</span></div></div>",

Your eyes shoot open, laying, cuddled up to you, was Sara, but she no longer looked like a normal fox, instead she had human qualities like all the anthro creatures you were running from in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara must have heard your heart rate increase because she lifted her head and looked at you, \"what's wrong?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your n-n-not a normal fox are you?\" you ask, fear slowing filling your voice, Sara's ears droop lower than when you first meet her, \"I'm sorry I thought you would be ok with me like this\" she says in a sad voice, she starts to get up to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach out and stop her, \"why are you leaving?\" you ask, \"because you don't feel safe around me, don't lie I can tell\" she says.

You start removing your jacket and shirt and Sara removes your pants and underwear, you didn't even finish getting your t-shirt off your head before Sara resumed kissing you. It wasn't long before your 'soldier' was standing at attention, she inserted it into her sex and began moving up and down. The two of you continue for what feel like hours of pure ecstasy before the both of you climax at the same time, \"how was your first time with someone like me?\" Sara pants as she lays her head on your chest. \"That.......was very interesting\" you say, running a hand through her matted fur, she gives you a small lick on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter laying around for a little, you both get cleaned up and eat a little breakfast before heading out on the road. \"So where were you going before you met me?\" Sara asks, \"heh....um nowhere in particular, I was just trying to get away from those creatures, no offense\" you say, she waves a dismissive paw, \"none taken\" she says. \"I have a suggestion, some of my friends and family are living in what you humans call Seattle\" she says. \"but what about me\" you ask, \"don't worry the furries, as we go by, live in harmony with the humans that still remain in the city\" she says. \"Well we're going to need to find some wheels unless you like walking\" you say, she nods her head in agreement. For hours the two of you walk along the barren road, no vehicles in sight, \"I hope you brought enough water for the two of us\" Sara says, just then you spot a building in the distance, using your rifle scope you can tell it is a gas station, but the best part was a car was outside. \"I think I just found our ride\" you say with a grin on your face, you both take of at a small jog towards the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you both make it and see that the car was a 1973 Hemi Barracuda and it was in a good condition, as you look inside you see it was packed full of useless items like golf clubs and electronics. You pop the trunk and see it was also filled with useless items, \"tsk tsk tsk, its sad how some people think they can just pack up their lives and take it with them\" you say quietly to yourself. You and Sara clean out the car and only repack anything of use, you gas up the car and fill up any gas cans you could find, you also salvage any food from inside the station before driving away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe previous owner left behind an interesting collection of music with the car, currently the two of you were listening to a Led Zeppelin song while you were driving. For most of the day the two of you listen to every song in the collection with you answering every question Sara had about the bands. Your favorite comment she made was about The Beatles, it went something along the lines of \"how can tiny bugs make music?\". Eventually it gets dark out so you pull over for the night because you didn't have any night vision goggles and you didn't want to be driving with the lights on and potentially attract unwanted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sara climb in the back seat and use it as a makeshift bed, \"hey I have to tell you something\" she says, \"sure what is it?\" you ask. \"Well I know I haven't known you for long, but I think I'm having feelings for you\" she says shyly. This catches you off guard a little, although Sara was very attractive and the two of you did have sex in the barn that morning, you were till unsure of your feeling towards her because like she said, you haven't known her that long. You must have been taking a while to answer because Sara brushed your face with her tail, \"did you hear me?\" she asks, \" yeah I think......\"</span></div></div>",

You close your eyes and soon your asleep too, you open your eyes and find yourself still in the backseat, but bound and gagged, you could feel the car was driving, \"that lying piece of.... she was just fooling me!\" you say to yourself. You begin struggling against your bindings, you must have made enough noise to grab Sara's attention because she looked back at you, \"oh your finally awake\" she says, she pulls over and hops in the back and sits you up. \"Let me go!\" you yell through the gag, \"hang on, just calm down first and let me explain\" she says as she frees your mouth, but you kept your mouth shut and refrained from yelling any expletives at her, giving her a chance to explain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a group of furs that liked to harm humans that came by earlier and I convinced them you were my slave by tying you up like that, honest\" she says with her ears lowered, expecting you to lash out at her, but you kept your calm. You sigh, \"can you untie me please?\" you ask in a calm voice, she nods and frees your arms and legs, \"are you mad at me?\" she asks in a quiet voice, her face looked that of a child who knew they did something wrong and were expecting to get punished. \"I'm not really mad at you, after all, you kind of saved me\" you say, setting your hands on her shoulders,\" really?\" she says, her ears perking up, you nod, she gave you a hug, but a gentler one compared to the one she gave you in the barn. After she releases you she pecks you on the lips and climbs back over into the front passenger seat, \"come on lazy bones\" she says patting the driver seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile to yourself and gracefully make your way over, soon the two of you were back on the road to Seattle, \"so I have to ask, how did you know how to drive a stick shift?' you ask. \"Easy, I watched you do it and I'm a quick learner\" she says, laying her head across your lap, \"but I'm not used to driving for long periods like you\" she says tiredly. \"How long were you driving?' you ask, \"umm I drove I think for about four or five hours while you slept\" she says, \"wow was I really out that long?\" you ask. \"Eh I got up early and drove because I couldn't sleep and I figured it was best to get a head start on today's drive\" she says, her eyes fluttering shut, she wrapped her arms around your mid section, \"do me one last favor\" she say sleepily, \"sure\" you say, \"try not to hit any pot holes while I'm asleep\" she says, \"you chuckle, \"ok, I promise\" you say petting her head as she finally drifts off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Her claws pop out and see reaches out towards you, you whimper and close your eyes, \"this is it I guess\" you say to yourself, suddenly you feel your arms being freed. You look at the cougar in surprise, \"why--\" before you could say anymore, she silences you with a paw over the mouth, she points above at the ceiling, \"when I say to, start screaming like we're tearing you apart ok?\" she whispers in your ear, you nod confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stand back up \"I guess dinner's server girls!\" she says out loud, suddenly you hear the sound of cloth tearing, and then the cougar points to you so you let out the loudest bloodcurdling scream you could manage. The wolf/leopard/fox cut you off abruptly with her paws, just then you hear voices coming from the first room, \"well I guess that's that\" you recognize as the female that threw you down here, then you hear the sounds of multiple footsteps leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cougar hugs you, squishing you in her large cleavage, \"you did well, now for part two\" she says setting you down, \"part two? hang on whats going on?!\" you say confused. You hear giggling behind you, \"aww look the human's all confused, explain it to him Sarah\" you look over your shoulder and see the golden retriever sitting behind you. The cougar sits in front of you, \"well lets start with introductions, I'm Sarah and that's Ramona hiding behind you\" she say pointing to the dog, \"this is Matilda and that bundle of joy over there is Arokh\" she says pointing to the jaguar and the hybrid, the jaguar waved to you, but the wolf/leopard just let out a light growl at Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait I saw six sets of eyes\" you say looking around the room and then you spot a tiger and a husky sitting away from you, \"ah yes, that is Mira and Fay\" says Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is part two?\" you ask, \"part two of our plan\" says Ramona, \"they feed us one human, once a week so our strength isn't great enough to escape\" Sarah explains, you look at her confused, \"how do I fit in with all this?\" you ask. \"We you se you are going to feed yourself to us and we will gain enough energy that we can break outta here\" she says, you look at her in horror, \"hang on hang on.....how am I going to 'feed' all six of you?\" you ask. \"Well after weeks of saving up energy I can reform you each time, so I can reform you after feeding you to whoever is number six and you can escape with us\" says Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there thinking, \"and if I refuse?\" you ask, \"well then we go through with the plan, but don't reform you in the end\" says Ramona. \"How do I know you will reform me in the end if I agree?\" you ask, Sarah shrugs, \"you'll just have to trust us then\" says Arohk..........</span></div></div>",

Like before with Ramona, Sarah ran her tongue over your face repeatedly, coating your face in her warm saliva, despite having razor sharp teeth, she took extra care not to draw blood. As soon as she got to your shoulders she copied Ramona and lifted you up, and used gravity to her advantage, but it took her five gulps until she got to your calves, she reached down and started to rub her gut as you entered your second stomach today. In one final gulp, she swallows the last of you, as you curl up again, you could hear her purring loudly, \"Ramona was right, you're not bad tasting\" she purrs, rubbing her enlarged belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, it was only a mater of time before you passed out from lack of oxygen, this time when you woke up, you were pressed up against Matilda, you look over and see Sarah with a bulging stomach like Ramona. \"So how exactly does this work?\" you ask, pointing to the bulges that were...well you. \"Well you see after a while my stomach starts to--\" \"no no no...I get that I meant was how do you keep reforming me. I mean am I a clone or something?\" you interrupt. Sarah makes a face as she tries to think of a way to explain this to you, \"sort of, but you're still the original you, I mean......its difficult to explain\" she says, you nod, that explanation was better than no explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the day the eating process was repeated for Matilda, Mira, and Fay, they would swallow you up to your shoulders before using gravity to assist them. You would curl up in their stomach and pass out before digestion really set in, but when it got to Arohk she wanted to do something different. \"Its a little something I always wanted to try, don't worry you'll still reform in the end like we promised\" she said, you look behind you, Ramona, Matilda, Mira, and Fay were laying down, sleeping off their meals, but Sarah stayed awake, probably to keep an eye on you, Sarah nodded, \"its ok, you'll be reformed again, a deals a deal\" she says. You turn to Arohk, \"ok what did you want to try?\" you ask, she didn't say anything, she grabbed you and hugged you tightly, her tails wrapping around you, you were completely surprised by the sudden change in events, you set you head on her shoulder, getting a good face-full of her fur, suddenly you feel yourself sinking into Arohk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it you were curled up in her stomach, \"well that was......odd\" you say, you settle into the most comfortable position and wait for oxygen depravation to take its toll. Soon you wake up laying next to Arohk and Sarah, \"see everything's back to normal...well almost normal\" says Sarah, Arohk hands your clothing to you, because of todays 'events' you are exhausted so as you get dressed, you only managed to get your pants and underwear on before you fall asleep............</span></div></div>",

You sit up and open your eyes fully and thats when you remembered where you were, \"sorry Ramona, you reminded me of...never mind\" you say, rubbing you eyes, Ramona tilts her head at you. You look around and see the others were still asleep, their stomaches no longer bulging from their 'meal', \"whats going on\" you say in a low whisper, \"I figured i'd wake you and give you a chance to finish getting dressed and all before the main event\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank her and start putting your clothes back on, as you tie up your boots you feel Ramona moving closer to you, you turn around and there she was, less than an arms length from you, \"yes?\" you ask. \"I was wondering, who is Roxy?\" she asks, you sigh, \"I'll tell you what, answer my question and I'll answer your's, deal?\" you say, ramona nods. \"Ok, mine's kind of a two-part: where did all you guys come from and why the hatred of humans?\" you ask, \"ok well the first answer is easy, we've been here on Earth the whole time, just living in secret and the second part is we are going after humans because they are destroying and polluting everything, your constant fighting with each other with war and crime and hate is too much\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the ground in silence while you digest the info she gave you, she must have though you forgot about your part of the deal because she nudged to and brought you out of your thoughts. \"Wha...oh sorry, anyways, Roxy was my pet retriever like you and you reminded me of her because she used to wake me up the same way\" you say, \"she was your pet?\" Ramona asks, confused and with a small trace of anger deep in her voice. \"Well more like a family member, she was a stray and I rescued her, slowly bringing her back to health and integrating her as a member of my family, so she was more than just a pet to me\" you say, \"oh well....where is she?\" Ramona asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day we were at the park like we usually did, I threw a tennis ball and she went through some bushes after it....and that was the last time I saw her, to this day I don't know what happened\" you say starting to tear up, \"about a week later a friend of mine found.........\" you stop, choking on your words, Ramona grabs you and pulls you into a hug and starts stroking the back of your head, \"...I told him it couldn't be her because there was no collar, but he told me I was suffering from grief...\" you say, full out sobbing. Surprisingly the others stayed asleep, after a good five minutes of crying you stop with a little help from Ramona, the sound of her heartbeat and being wrapped up in her fur helped calm you down. \"I'm sorry about Roxy and maybe I was wrong about all humans, there are those out there like you who aren't all evil I guess\" says Ramona, You reach up and scratch her behind the ears, causing her tail to go wild, she gives you a good lick across the face, \"still not bad tasting\" she says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh at her joke as she lets go of you and wakes up the others, as they stretch you notice they seem to be full of renewed energy from the meals and some 'extra additions' to certain areas. \"All good to go?\" asks Sarah, everyone nods, Arohk, Sarah, and Fay all grab at the large steel door and lift, little by little the door starts to raise, they lifted it about four feet in the air before Sarah starts waving for everyone to go under. You had to crouch down and do a mini summersault under, as soon as every one was under, Ramona, Mira, and Matilda grabbed the door so Sarah, Arohk, and Fay could slide under. Once they were under they slowly set the door back down as not to alert anyone that might be near by, \"ok this part might be better suited for you\" says Sarah, pointing at you, Arohk and Fay boost you up to the trap door that you fell down the previous day, you manage to get your fingers in between the two halves of the door and pry open the door, they set you down and Fay boosts Sarah up followed by Arohk, Matilda, Mira and finally Ramona, they turned around and pulled up Fay. You stood there waiting for them to pull you up, but nothing happened, \"they didn't just leave me did they?\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting ten minutes............</span></div></div>",

You turn the paper over and on the back was a set of numbers, they weren't latitude and longitude numbers and they weren't military grid coordinates, \"what could these be?\" you think to yourself., You spot a book on the table next to the note, when you open the book you see it was a book about supply depots in the United Stated, \"odd.....hang on\" you say, you look at the numbers and then the book and thats when it hits you. The first number a page number and the second one took you to a paragraph and the third one took you to a picture, soon you come up with the directions to a medium warehouse/ surplus store.

You chuckle to yourself as you carefully navigate the maze of bodies in search of a restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you locate an employee bathroom and relieve yourself, as you open the door to leave you see Mira standing in the doorway, \"jeez!...Mira you scared the crap out of me\" you say. The husky gave you a small smile, \"but I thought you just finished going\" she says, pointing to the stall, \"oh ha ha....anyways do you need something?\" you ask, \"yeah I need to go too\" she says, thats when you saw she was doing a small bathroom dance. You apologize and quickly leave, but as you return to the others yo hear the sound of glass clinking together, at first you thought it was one of the girls, but a quick head count proved that theory wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou draw your handgun and make your way toward the noise, you make your way into the food section of the store, again you hear the sound of clinking glass and grunting. You turn the corner with your flashlight and pistol raised and to your surprise, siting on the floor was a female fox with her back to you. She either didn't notice your flashlight or didn't care, as you neared her you saw she had something in her hands, as you look around her you see she had taken a jar of strawberry jam and it was giving her a hard time. \"Hello?\" you say with a cautious, but authoritative voice, the fox froze and slowly turned around, jar in her jaws, slowly she set the jar down and got to her feet, she didn't do or say anything, except stare at you, suddenly you feel yourself loose control of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox let out a cute laugh, \"why don't you put that gun down\" she says in an almost seductive voice, suddenly you find yourself setting your pistol on the ground and there was nothing you could do. It was if the fox in control of everything, but your thoughts, she made a curling motion with her finger, suddenly you found yourself walking towards the fox, you fight to stop your body from walking, but it wasn't working, \"its no use, you might as well stop resisting\" she said................</span></div></div>",

They all smiled when they saw you up, and Rena walked over and snuggled up to you. 'It's great that she is getting used to us.' You thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly their was a loud crash and everyone looked around for the source. Then out of the corner of your eye you spotted someone running away. \"THERE!!\" You shout and Sarah jumped up and ran as fast as she could to catch the person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of you followed her to find out who the person was. Then you hear a loud scream. 'That sounded like a young boys scream.' You thought. Then you find Sarah on the ground pinning someone under her. You look and see that you were right about them being a young boy. He looked roughly 15, maybe 16 years old, and he was scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't kill me! I-I-I don't want any trouble! I was just looking for food!\" He was on the verge of tears. You walked over to him and look him in the eyes. He was scared shitless. You walked away called for Sarah to come over too. She slowly got up and still held the boy in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch him.\" Sarah said to the others. She walked over to you. \"So, what do you think we should do with him?\" \"I think he is telling the truth about looking for food, but if that's true then he must be alone, which also means that he must have been separated from his family or something along the lines of that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked you then the boy he was acting just like how Rena was last night when she was caught. \"So you think he should stay?\" \"Yeah, unless you think he shouldn't.\" She thought for a moment and then looked at you. \"OK he can stay, but first we should ask him some questions.\" \"Agreed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walked over to the boy and he backed up only to run into a wall. He started to panic so you reassured him. \"Don't worry we just to ask you a few questions.\" He looked at you in fear. \"What k-k-kind of questions?\" He asked. \"Simple ones like what's your name and where are your parents or any family member, because let's face it you probably had some family member around, am I right?\" Said Sarah. He looked at her and his eyes started to water. \"My mom and Dad are dead...\" He said softly. He began to cry softly and said something else. \"Your kind killed them about a week ago...and...and...I...I've...\" He began to fully cry and Sarah felt really bad for unintentionally bring this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and everyone else looked at the boy with sympathy. He had his parents taken from him, and he had been alone for the past week and had possible been morning his loss. \"I'm sorry I didn't know.\" Sarah said. She suddenly walked over and hugged the boy. \"It's ok your safe now. I promise that nothing will happen to you, If you stay with us we will be able to protect you.\" She said and the boy continued to cry. After a few minutes the stopped crying and looked Sarah in the eyes. \"Thank you...I needed that...\" He said as he wiped a tear from his eye. \"So will you stay?\" Sarah asked, and almost instantly the boy answered. \"Yes I'll stay...As long as I don't get tackled again...That hurt.\" Sarah laughed a little. \"I promise you won't get tacked again.\" Sarah said and the boy hugged her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later everyone was relaxing and just talking. You found out more about the boy too. His name was Michael. He was from Canada, but once everything went to hell he came to the U.S. in hopes of a better chance at survival. He soon found that survival here was harder, due to more Anthros and bandits, but he learned how to survive quickly. He had to, if he wanted to live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Michael was comfortable around everyone he opened up quite a bit. Soon everyone was talking and laughing, just having a good time. It almost felt like everything was normal. It was almost as if the world was as it was before. It was the first time that any of them had peace in a long time.</span></div></div>",

As you grab for it you hear a voice, \"holy shit man are you ok?\", you look over and see a male dressed in faded cargo pants and a slightly torn shirt running toward you. Behind him you saw five other humans all armed with an assortment of weapons, you noticed a female with a high caliber sniper rifle slung over her shoulder, \" I'm sorry I thought that you were one of them\" she says lowering her head. \"Hey buddy are you ok?\" the first male asked again, \"I'll be ok\" you say as you get to your feet. \"My name is Johnny,\" says the male, \"this is Amber\" he says pointing to the female with the sniper rifle, \"and that is Anthony, Henry, Zak, and Sasha\" says Johnny pointing the the other four members of the group. \"Christopher\" you say holding out your hand for shaking, all of you talk about what happened and apologize are exchanged .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you can come with us if you want\" says Zak, \"where are you guys headed?\" you ask, \"well our plan was to head to the near by National Guard base and get some wheels and then head into Detroit, there''s supposedly refuge there\" he says. \"Sure you'll need help piloting any military vehicles we find\" you say, \"alright then we should get moving while there's still light out\" says Anthony. The seven of you head out towards the base that Zak was talking about, after about four hours of walking you come across what was left of the base, all the fencing around the base was trampled and bent, just about every door on all the buildings was either broken down or torn up with claw marks. Every now and then you would find the charred remains of vehicles or discarded weapons, every where you looked you saw spent shell casings littering the ground. \"I think its safe to say that we are the only ones here\" says Henry, \"at least the only humans here, remember those anthro creatures could still be here\" says Sasha. \"Alright lets find some transport and get out of here\" says Johnny, the group heads toward the motor pool or rather what was left of it, most the the vehicles were missing, most likely used during the evacuation of the nearby cities, but a few of the Humvees were just broken, charred hulls, there were however three untouched, but one had flat tires and would be no good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on lets take these two\" said Henry, \"they won't do, their range is too small and they aren't armored\" you say. \"why do they need to be armored?\" Henry asks, \"because I've seen those anthros rip off the doors and pull out the occupants\" you tell him. \"Hey what about this?\" says Amber you look at what she was pointing at, at the end of the motor pool sat a lone eight wheeled armored Stryker, \"that'll do\" you say. After a quick inspection you find that it only needed to be filled up and it was good to go, \"try to find any gas can and fill them up too, I don't want to stop any more than we need to\" says Johnny. You, Sasha, Zak, and Anthony head off into the main building to locate any gas cans, food, or weapons to take with you, the four of you come to a split in the hallway, \"ok if my time in the military has taught me anything, its that most bases are the same, so weapons and ammo should be this way and food, water should be that way\" you say. \"I hate to say it, but we need to split up if we want to do this quickly\" says Sasha, \"ok then you two get the weapons and any ammo while Anthony and I get food and water\" says Zak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sasha leave and head towards where you think the armory is, surprisingly the lights still worked inside which you liked, because the only think you hated more than dark corridors were dark corridors with anthros in them. As you walked down the hallway you saw more spent shells casings over the floor, broken glass and foot prints in what you assumed was dried blood, both human and animal. Sasha peeked in a random room, suddenly both your noses were assaulted with a horrid smell, \"oh god!\" Sasha said putting her hand up to her mouth and nose. You didn't need to look in to know that some anthros had turned the closet into their personal bathroom, \"come on lets go\" you say grabbing her arm and dragging her away from the closet. Soon the two of you locate the armory and start filling up on any ammo that you could use, you made sure to grab some .50 cal ammo for the Stryker's M2, you locate a new ceramic chest plate so you replace your's with that one, \"alright lets get out of here, we've been in here longer than I like to\" says Sasha, you nod and grab the duffle bags that you filled with ammo, weapons and some body armor and leave........</span></div></div>",

Just as you close the feed cover on the M2 you hear a noise, you look up and see a group of three anthros walking toward the base perimeter, \"uh guys get in and seal the rear hatch\" you say, \"why?\" asks Johnny, you point the the anthros that seemed to now notice you and were moving at a fast pace towards you, \"alright people move it\" he says.

Quickly the three of you sprint to the hotel door and head in, you hear the sound of the Stryker's rear hatch click and lock shut as you enter the hotel. \"Ok Johnny were to now?\" you ask, shining your flashlight around the dark hallway, \"second floor, that's where she said to meet her when I returned\" he says, \"she?\" you say, \"yeah, her name is Kikio, she's a Kitsune\" he says. You give him a confused look, \"you know, a nine tailed fox\" he says holding up nine fingers, \" doesn't matter, lets just go met this Kikio\" you say. The three of you reach the second floor which was just another dark corridor, \"really hate these\" you think to yourself as you shine you light over every nook and cranny in the hallway. The one thing that bugged you the most was the large hole in the ceiling, upon closer inspection you saw it lead into what you assumed were ventilation ducts. \"Hmm she said she would meet me here\" says Johnny, \"do you think she doesn't yet know you're here?\" says Anthony, he shakes his head, \"no Kikio told me she <i>definitely</i> would know when I was here\" he says. Suddenly you feel something wrap itself around you and drag you up toward the hole in the ceiling, causing you to drop your rifle. You manage to grasp onto the edge of the hole and stop yourself from being dragged away, \"hold on\" yelled Anthony, \"you better move quick\" you shout as the metal edges of the duct start to bend. \"No no no no no n-Hmph!\" suddenly you get silenced as something furry wrapped around your face and pulled down the ventilation shaft, you are dragged for what feels like miles through the ducts before coming to a stop face to face with a set of glowing emerald eyes.

Out of habit you check her out, even though she stood like a human her feet were more canine than human, beneath the kimono she boasted a bust that would make most female jealous, flowing behind her you saw nine furry tails that seemed inviting, and her face had a certain type of beauty to it, almost made you feel bad for yelling at her. She turned to Johnny, \"is this all?\" she asked, \"no there are four more waiting in a vehicle outside\" he says, \"well bring them in out of the rain and get them a decent place to sleep tonight\" Kikio says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better go, Zak might accidentally shoot at you if he sees you\" you say to Kikio, she nods understandingly. \"Here you dropped this earlier\" says Anthony as he hands you your rifle, you head back outside in the rain and wave to the Stryker, you hear the rear hatch unlock and lower, \"is it safe?\" you hear Sasha ask, \"yeah\" you answer. The other four come out of the Stryker and run inside out of the rain, standing in what used to be the main lobby of the hotel was Kikio, Johnny, another human, and a female anthro rabbit. \"My name is Kikio and this is Aaron and that is Maddy\" says Kikio, gesturing to the other human and the rabbit. The rabbit stepped forward, \"I will take you to your rooms, if you don't feel comfortable around me I understand and Aaron will show you to your rooms instead\" says Maddy. Soon the group moved off following the rabbit girl up the stairs, leaving you, Kikio, and Johnny alone, Johnny turns to you, \"still want to leave?\" he asks, \"oh at least stay the night, don't go out in this rain\" begs Kikio, you let out a long sigh, \"alright I'll stay for the night, who knows maybe I will change my mind\" you say. \"Excellent where would you like to stay?\" she asks....</span></div></div>",

Johnny explains to Kikio how your rib became broken, how Amber had mistaken you for a hostile fur, \"well if he's injured he's staying with me\" she says. \"No I'm fine I've had worse\" you tell her, \"nonsense, you are staying with me until its healed, end of story\" she says, helping you to your feet and directing you to a set of stairs, the two of you climb the stairs to the second floor, but it didn't look the same, for starters the hole in the ceiling was gone and the whole hallway looked clean and well kept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" you say noticing the change, \"I'll explain later,\" says Kikio as she walks you towards a room, inside, the hotel room looked more like a small apartment complete with a kitchen, bathroom, and living room/bedroom combo. She set you down on the large bed and proceeded to carefully remove your shirt and vest, \"what are you doing?\" you ask, \"I need to get a better look at your injuries\" she says as she pulls off your shirt. Having someone of her species starting to undress you unnerved you, you flinch at her touch and are hesitant with her removing your vest and weapons, \"whats wrong?\" she asks at your fidgeting. \"I'm sorry I'm just not used to--\" \"someone like me?\" she says, finishing your sentence, you nod, she gets up and turns off the lights, the room was dark except for the small amount of moonlight that came in through the window, \"is that better?\" she asks. All you could see of Kikio was her glowing emerald eyes in the dark, \"a little\" you say, suddenly you feel something thrown at you, you hold it up in the moonlight and see it was her kimono.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you ask, \"well I figured if I was seeing you without a shirt, it might make you feel better if I didn't have one on either\" she says walking over to you, the moonlight shining on her, revealing that she no longer was wearing her kimono. She ran her fox-like hands over your injured rib, \"well I have bad news and good news, the bad news is you have three broken ribs and two cracked\" she says. \"Well whats the good news?\" you ask, \"I can heal your ribs, but its going to take a couple of days of bed rest\" she says. You nod, she places a hand on your ribs and closes her eyes, you feel the area around your injuries go numb, but you could feel the broken ribs shift as they were moved back into place, \"how is she doing this?\" you think to yourself as the last bone was reset into its proper place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKikio open her eyes, her breathing sounded like she just ran a marathon, \"it must take a lot of energy to do that\" you think to yourself. Kikio crawls into the bed and lays next to you, soon she was asleep, snoring lightly, her tails swishing slowly over the bed. For you this was a new experience, sleeping next to a nude, nine tailed fox, in a hotel filled with more of these furry creatures and humans. You attempt to relax your mind and try to fall asleep, just before you drift off you feel one of Kikio's tails wrap itself around you waist and pulling you closer to her body. You were too tired to release yourself so you just roll over and fall asleep......</span></div></div>",

As you walk out of the bathroom you see Kikio sitting on the foot of the bed with the tray next to her, \"I thought you could use some breakfast\" she says gesturing to the tray. You sit on the bed and start eating some of the food, it was a huge change compared to the rations you've been eating, \"so some of our other guests wanted to know if they could stop by and check on you\" says Kikio. \"What other guests?\" you ask, \"well there are about ten other humans here besides you and there are about fifteen other anthros like me here and some of the anthros what to see you if it ok to visit you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....sure, how many want to see me?\" you ask, Kikio smiles and walks over to the door and opens it, standing out in the hallway are at least ten anthros, most were female. All the females were staring at you, giggling amongst themselves, a few waved to you, which you returned. You could see three of the anthros were males, a wolf, some type of lizard and a black panther were standing behind the females. Kikio gestured for them to enter, to your surprise you saw a couple anthros that you've never seen before, like one of the female was a shark and another female was a mix of a husky and a fox. Surprisingly all of them fit in to the room comfortably without any one bumping arms and stepping on tails, a couple of the females gathered around the floor near your feet, you look at Kikio with a concerned face, \"do you do this with every new person that stays here?\" you ask, \"sometimes, but not all the time\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKikio looks at the group, \"who wants to go first?\" she asks, almost instantly every hand...err..paw shot up in the air, you look around and point to.............</span></div></div>",

Carefully you sit up and move towards her, she turns away from you and hides her face,embarrassed, \"what is it?\" you ask, gently setting a hand on her furry shoulder, slowly she looks back at you and looks you right in the eyes \"well.....we are together, i found you about a two months ago, all hurt and dirtied up and i rescued you, took you in and nursed you back to health, and well...heh, i fell in love with you and you did too, we looked out for each other and such\" she says, getting all teary eyed as she spoke, placing a paw on your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this you look at her shocked, searching your memory, trying to find any trace of Kikio, but not remembering a thing \"why cant i remember you at all, i want to so bad, but i cant\" you say, upset at yourself, Kikio moves closer to you and puts her paw on your shoulder now \"i don't know, all i know is you went out for supplies one day and never returned, i searched for you everywhere and just when i was beginning to give up, i found you again\" she says, giving you a happy smile, which quickly disappeared \"but it seems you haven't found me again\" she says, looking at you sad like.......</span></div></div>",

She stopped and you hear her make a small gasp, looking at you with tears in her eye as she slowly smiled and accepted your hand \"of course i will\" she murred, moving closer to you, holding your hand close to her chest, nervously making a move to kiss you, \"Im really gonna do this\" you say to yourself as Kikio's soft lips pressed against yours, shocked at how human like this was, kissing a furry like her. Very slowly she straddled your waist and wrapped her arms around your head, pressing her large bust against your bare chest, as you close your eyes you feel her soft and inviting tails wrap around the two of you, holding you in a tight and warm embrace, gingerly you put your hands on her hips, running your fingers through her soft fur, hearing her murr happily in the kiss as you do that. For what feels like an eternity, the two of you stay like that, human and Kitsune, interlocked in an embrace before finally breaking off and looking at her, smiling as you starting to feel something towards her, \"Kikio... I think I'm starting to realize why i fell in love with you in the first place\" hearing this put a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you think thats good, i can always to better\" she says, smiling seductivly, moving closer and whispering in your ear something that makes you blush a bit and start to get you worked up enough that she felt your growing arousal through your pants. \"I'm sensing that it worked\" she says with a grin.............</span></div></div>",

Kikio nods, \"understandable, let me go get you something to sleep with at least\" she says, you look out at the Stryker, \"thank you but that won't be---\" as you turn around you saw Kikio had disappeared leaving Johnny standing there with his arms crossed, \"where'd she go?\" you ask Johnny. He turns to where Kikio was and drops his arms, \"she was here a second ago, I didn't hear her leave\" he says spinning around the room looking for her. You suddenly feel a tap on your shoulder making you jump, you turn and see Kikio standing there with a pillow and blanket tucked under her arm, \"sorry I didn't mean to scare you\" she says. You take the pillow and blanket, say your goodnights and run out into the rain to the Stryker, you get in and seal the ramp behind you, making sure it and all the other hatches were locked tight so no anthros could sneak in during the night. You set you gear down in a fashion so if someone tried to get in you could defend yourself, you lay out the pillow and blanket and after making sure everything was turned off, laid down and drifted off to sleep to the sound of the rain hitting the Stryker's hull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself face to face with a set of glowing green eyes, you struggle to get free of whatever had your arms pinned to your sides, \"let me go!' you bellow at the eyes. You see a set of glowing white teeth form in an evil smile beneath the eyes, \"I don't think so lunch\" a voice said in an evil tone, suddenly the teeth open and lunge forward as you scream. You jolt awake from your nightmare so fast that you smack your head on one of the benches in the Stryker. \"Ow...son of a...\" you whisper as you sit up rubbing your forehead, you look at your watch's glowing hands, \"wow only been asleep for an hour and the nightmares are already starting\" you whisper. Just then you hear the sound of the ramp unlocking and start to lower, you reach over and grab you sidearm and take aim as the ramp dropped on its own accord. As the ramp settled on the ground you saw a figure standing there with glowing emerald eyes, \"damn it Kikio, I just want you to know I almost shot you\" you say, \"mmm no you wouldn't have\" she says as she walks up the ramp and out of the rain. \"Come to convince me to stay?\" you ask as the ramp raises up and re-locks, \"no just to talk\" she says, you try to read her face, but it was too dark in the Stryker and the only source of light was from the FLIR monitor which only illuminated the front half of the interior so all you could see was Kikio's glowing eyes in the dark staring at you. \"And I brought you something hot to drink\" she say, \"what is it?\" you ask, \"what you humans call coffee, I think I finally figured how to make it\" she says, you turn on one of the electric camping lanterns that you acquired during your travels, sitting on the set of benched to your right was Kikio in her drenched kimono, \"here take my jacket and lets hang that up to dry\" you say as you remove you jacket and hand it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKikio gives you a small smile and accepts the jacket, you avert your gaze so she could remove the kimono and put on the jacket, you feel Kikio slide under the covers next you. \"Sorry I don't exactly wear pants under that kimono\" she says as you hang up the drenched clothing, \"but you're at least wearing underwear right?\" you say, \"oh of course, I may be an animal, but I'm still civilized\" she says making you chuckle, \"what does wearing underwear have to do with being civilized?\" you ask, \"actually on second thought don't answer that\" you add. You sit back down as Kikio was pouring you a cup of coffee from the thermos she brought with her, \"so what did you want to talk about?\" you ask, accepting the cup of coffee. \"Well..........\"</span></div></div>",

You shake your head, \"no I don't\" you say, Kikio reaches over and touches your right temple...........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Three months ago)<br>\r\n.....You pant heavily as you run down the road towards where you dismounted the Humvees and Strykers, the bulky chemical protection gear and gas mask you wore made it difficult to run. You look to your left and see your closet friend Nick Rivers following you, Nick had lost his mask when the situation turned south and his face was filled with pure fear as the two of you ran from the strange anthro creatures that seemed to have appeared out of thin air and overwhelmed your company. You round the corner just as a Stryker transport goes flying down the road in front of you, you spot an unoccupied Humvee so you and Nick climb in and take off after the Stryker. \"This is Rhino 6-3 is anyone out there?\" the radio squawked, \"roger Rhino 6-3 this is Corporal Rivers, was that you in the Stryker that we saw hauling ass?\" Nick says into the radio. \"Yeah, how many of you are there?\" was the response, \"just us two\" Nick responds, \"we got eight in here plus two crew\" said the radio, \"add another four to that count\" said a different voice on the radio. You look in the side mirror and see another Humvee behind you, \"ok Rhino 6-3 we're going to follow you to extraction point uuuhhh.....hang on......Point delta\" said the unknown voice, \"roger\" was Rhino's response. It amazed you that there were back up extraction points for everything, for half an hour your small convoy quickly navigated the abandoned streets of Chicago with your Humvee in the rear and the Stryker in lead, the whole time you were driving you were trying to wrap your head around the fact that out of about 200+ men in your company, only 16 were accounted for. Suddenly the Humvee in front of you had it's rear tire explode, \"crap we just lost a tire, we can continue like this, but its going to slow us down and its going to take too long to replace it with the spare.....How much room do you have in the Stryker?\" the driver of the Humvee asked over the radio, \"we can make room\" responded Rhino, the convoy pulled over and the four men in the Humvee got out and moved into the Stryker, all you could do was sit in the driver's seat and pray not to get ambushed, because your Humvee had no gun attached to it, in less than five minutes the convoy had resumed its drive without further incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you find yourself in some type of warehouse and factory section of the city, just then, without warning a large smoke stack from one of the factories came crashing down, blocking your route and again causing the even smaller convoy to halt. \"Ok.........hang on and try to stay close behind us\" said Rhino 6-3 from the radio, the Stryker made a hard right and was perpendicular to an office building of sorts, just then the Stryker took off straight at the building and crashed through the front wall and showed no sign of slowing, you had no choice but to follow it through the large hole it was creating in the building. As the Stryker finished its path of destruction it turned left and was back on the main road with you behind it, but the eight wheeled APC came to a halt for the third time, from your angle you saw one of those animal creatures standing in the middle of the intersection, but this one seemed different, it was a male fox with glowing yellow eyes and it wore some type of tunic, but the strange part was it had three tails behind it instead of the normal one tail. \"What the--\" Rhino started to say on the radio, but a voice in the background cut him off, \"KEEP GOING JUST PUSH THROUGH!\", the Stryker accelerated so fast that it left black streaks on the pavement, you stayed put and observed, \"holy crap he's toast\" said Nick. As the speeding Stryker neared the strange fox he didn't flinch, he just raised his left hand and to your shock so did the Stryker, it floated there with all eight wheels spinning in place, with a flick of his wrist the APC went flying into the nearby factory, smashing through the reinforced wall. You couldn't believe your eyes, a mere fox, just sent a 17 ton APC flying through a wall without breaking a sweat, just then the fox glared at you, at that point you threw the shifter in reverse and had the Humvee squealing backwards down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one quick motion you spun the Humvee around and had it flying down the road at about 70 MPH, \"holy shit man what do we do now?!?!\" panicked Nick. You stayed silent while you tried to think of a new plan, \"hey I said what do we do--\" Nick started again, but you cut him off, \"I don't know I'm working on it ok, you need to calm down!\" you yelled through your mask, since there was no 'chemical spill' you don't know why you still had it on. \"Sarge watch out!\" Nick shouted pointing out the windshield, standing in the road was another one of those multi-tailed foxes, you knew what they could do so you tried to make a hard left, but the Humvee was moving too fast to take the turn and you must have hit the curb or a fire hydrant, because the Humvee started to roll over,and it continued to roll, through a chain link fence and the side of a warehouse, before coming to a stop on it's roof. You lay on the roof of the upturned Humvee dazed and stunned, you look over and see the crash had knocked Nick unconscious, just then your door was ripped off its hinges and a clawed hand dragged you out, through the cracked lenses of the gas mask you saw a large female tigress grinning evilly at you, \"well well well look at what the kitty caught\" she said to herself. You mustered up your remaining energy and landed a solid punch on the tiger's nose, you knew you probably signed your life away, but you wanted to go out fighting even if it was a single punch. The tigress dropped you and clutched her now bleeding nose and let out a painful cry, when she dropped you you looked over and saw Nick being dragged out of the Humvee, \"why you little worm!\" she growled as she grabbed you again and swiped across your face, ripping off your mask and leaving three deep claw marks on your left cheek. Now it was your turn to grab your face and shout in pain, \"HE'S MINE\" another female voice bellowed, you turn and see it was the fox that caused you to crash, as she neared you could see she was wearing a brightly colored kimono with nine bushy tails coming out the back, she had emerald green eyes that burned with a fire behind them. Her and the tiger butted heads and proceeded to have a stare down, after what felt like forever the tiger backed down and dropped you at the fox's feet, \"fine you can have him, not really my type anyway\" she said as she turned to leave. The fox picked you up with one of her furry tails and lifted you to her face, \"you're not going to punch me too are you?' she asked in a surprisingly calm voice, \"please just don't eat me\" was all you could say in a tired voice, the fox let out a small giggle and touched a paw to your forehead, \"rest now\" she said as your world started to fade to black.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......You open your eyes and find yourself back in the rear of the Stryker with Kikio removing her hand from your temple, \"what did you just do?\" you ask, \"I merely dug through your memories\" she said. \"So you did meet me before the whole ventilation duct incident\" you say, Kikio nods, \"I'm sorry about the crash, I wasn't strong enough at the time to catch your vehicle\" she says, you reach over and set a hand on her shoulder, \" well a 5000 lbs truck going about 70 MPH wasn't meant to make tight turns at that speed so I guess technically it was mostly my fault for thinking I could take that turn\" you say as you take a sip of your coffee. \"do you remember what happened  after?\" Kikio asks, you shake your head no, \"would you like to know?\" she asks again.............</span></div></div>",

Despite the room being covered in snow there was still a resemblance to a normal hotel room, beds, bathroom, closets. You walk over to one of the bed and set your stuff on it, just then the bathroom door opened and out stepped a female snow leopard in just her underwear, the minute she saw you she tackled you, \"what are you doing in here?\" she demanded. \"Kikio said I could stay here\" you say hoping that this doesn't further anger her, but when she heard this a look of surprise and embarrassment rolled over her face, \"sorry I thought you were a peeping tom or something like that\" she says helping you to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways my name is Sara\" she says with a smile, revealing her sharp teeth which caught your attention. \"What is there something in my teeth, I just brushed them\" she says covering her mouth, \"no its...um well its just that this is the closest I've been to someone like you\" you tell her. \"Oh, well I hope I didn't scare you away with the whole tackling incident\" she says, \"no, but whats going to be the best way for me to sleep in here?' you say gesturing to all the snow. \" Well I have three ideas\" Sara says with a devilish grin, \"one you could sleep in my bed with me and let me keep you warm, two I can turn you into a snow leopard, temporary of course, and three you could just tough it out for the night\" she says</span></div></div>",

She fought against the hold as hard as possible, kicking and trying to claw your arm with her free hand, but that only used up her oxygen. Minutes later you feel her go limp from oxygen deprivation, you set her down on the porch, part of your mind was telling you to finish her, but you had some questions that only she knew the answers. After a brief search of the house you drag the unconscious wolf in and tied her up with some rope you found, after making sure she was properly bound you bandaged up her leg wound.

You walk in the room, \"so you're finally awake,\" you say, \"let me go now and I'll make your death quick and painless\" she snarls, \"mmmm...tempting, but I kind of like living right now\" you say. She struggled against the ropes, but you had her tied up too tight for her to easily escape, \"what do you want?\" she growls. \"I just want to ask you a few questions\" you tell her calmly, \"and if I don't cooperate, are you going to water-board me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over and see she was looking at the rag and bucket of water you used to clean her wound, \"no, I think you might enjoy that one too much\" you say. \"So then what, you're gonna pull out my teeth one by one?\" she snaps, \"no, I just want to know some simple things, like whats your name?\" you ask. The wolf simple growls at you, \"okay, how about why are you so hateful of humans?\" you ask, again she growls. You sigh and reach into one of your cargo pockets and pull out a tennis ball, instantly the wolf stopped growling and her eyes were glued to the ball. Over the course of your travels you found out that all these creatures hade the same type of minds like normal animals felines still chased after laser pointers and canines after balls and squeaky toys. You don't know why they do this, but its helped you out n the past to get out of tricky situations, but you've never used the technique in interrogations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou threw the ball an bounced it off the wall and made it come back to you, the wolf followed it with her eyes, panting like a dog, but she stopped herself and growled at you. Again you thew the ball and the same reaction, but this time she let out a small whimper, \"you know I can wait all day, just answer my questions\" you tell her, but she remained defiant. you continued the ball-throwing technique for four hours before she finally gave in, \"OK! *sigh* my name is Sheila,\" she says. \"See now was that so hard\" you say, Sheila shot you a mean look, \"now why does your species have a strong hatred against us?\" you ask, but Sheila just sits there quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and check your watch, it was around 7:15, you get up and head into the kitchen and prepare some food: some condensed soup with some bacon you found in the freezer. You brought your food back in to where the wolf was tied up, \"wants some?\" you offer, but she just turns her head away from you, \"not hungry\" she states, but you could tell that the smell of the bacon was getting to her. You sit in silence and eat your meal, after you finish you return to the kitchen to take care of your dishes and to make a meal for the wolf, even though you hated her guts, she was still a living creature. You return and set the bowl of soup and small plate of bacon on a table and dragged it toward her, \"I said I wasn't hungry\" she say, \"drop the act, you're not fooling me, now I'm going to untie you so you can eat deal?\" you say, the wolf nods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out one of your knifes and cut the rope keeping her bound, the minute she was free, she spin around with one hand over your throat and your knife in the other. \"Now I'm going to make your death as pain filled as possible\" she says as you feel your boots leave the floor, \"any last requests\" she sneers. \"Yeah, ask yourself this: 'why would the guy who is supposed to be my enemy, treat my wounds, give me food from his supply, and not torture me for information, but simple ask my name?\" you choked.

To you it felt completely different from any other kiss you ever had because of her long canine tongue wrestling with yours.

The only thing her kiss proved was that she was a good kisser nothing else, \"maybe I'm letting my paranoia get the best of me\" you think. \"I'll take that as a yes\" says Sheila as she sets you back down and walks over to the food you brought in for her, \"thank you for this, I haven't had anything all day\" she says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you make some small talk while Sheila eats, after she finished and the dishes taken care of you head upstairs to sleep and you find.....</span></div></div>",

In your head you knew it was a bad idea because you still didn't quite trust her even after her little kissing stunt she pulled earlier. \"Umm thats ok I'll be fine\" you say, \"please, I hate sleeping alone\" she whines. \"What kind of wolf are you?\" you ask, \"a nice one\" she answers, you sigh, \"fine, but I've got to clear some things up with my map first\" you lie, \"ok don't take too long\" Sheila says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk across the hall into the office/study and set your map on the desk and pretend to to be reading your map until you hear snoring coming from the bedroom.

You look at her confused, but you see she was fast asleep again, \"what kind of dream is she having about me and a store?\" you think to yourself.

You swing your feet over the edge of the bed and rub your face as look at the moonlight flooding through the window, if you had to guess it was a little past midnight out. Suddenly you hear a rattling sound coming from the kitchen area, you silently get up and retrieve your handgun from the office room across the hall and make your way down the stairs. You enter the kitchen with your pistol at the ready, but no one was there, in fact there were no signs of anyone ever being in the kitchen recently, you turn to leave and suddenly you get struck in the face by something. On reflex you squeeze the trigger and fire harmlessly into a wall as you fall to the ground, you lay there dazed as you feel blood from a wound on your head pour down your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look and see an anthro coyote standing in the doorway with the frying pan in his hands, \"well look at what I found\" he says with an evil grin on his face.

Suddenly, out of no where a gray blur of wolf fur come flying down the stairs and slams the coyote into the doorframe causing him to release you, \"where are you going with my slave!\" she yelled into one of his ears, \"I didn't re--\" he started, but Sheila cut him off, \"of course you didn't, did you even bother to check the scent by the door, hmm?, no\" she growled, before he could say anything, Sheila grabbed him by the tail and the scruff of his neck, and chucked him out and slammed the door shut, locking it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to you, for a minute you thought she was going to show her true colors and make you her slave, but what she did next was the total opposite. \"Are you ok?\" she asked in a concerned voice, you lay there silently, still trying to process what just happened, \"hey he didn't hurt you did he?\" she asked again, \"um yea..just...um a frying pan to the face thats all\" you finally say. She lets out a small whine and hugs your head, \"wait...you're bleeding\" she says, touching the cut on your forehead, \"I'll be fine\" you say, but as you try to stand, Sheila pushed you back down, \"stay\" was all she said before she disappeared into the kitchen. She returned with a damp towel and started to clean the cut, \"do you mind if I ask you a question?\" you say, \"sure\" says Sheila, \"what did you mean by 'the scent by the door' ?\"you ask, even in the dark you could still see the fur on Sheila's face flutter, the anthro version of blushing. \"While you were asleep, I marked the door to let others know this was my house or sleeping area\" she says, you reach up and brush the fur on her left side, \"listen I want to thank you for saving me and I want to come clean with you, I lied about my map because I was afraid to sleep in the same room with you because I still didn't know if you were still acting and--\" before you could finish Sheila kissed you on the lips, not like the first time with tongue and all, but just a simple kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you broke the kiss it left you speechless for a minute, \"you're not mad at me?\" you ask, \"mad? not really, I understand your hesitation around me, if fact I didn't expect you to sleep in the bed with me\" she says, you laugh. \"Yeah thats a story for later\" you say, \"speaking of bed, I think we should go back to it\" she says, \"yeah want to help me up?' you ask, you expected Sheila to help you to your feet, but instead she sling you over her shoulder like a sac of potatoes and proceeds to carry you up the stairs, \"ok this is officially weird\" you say, Sheila merely laughs.

Looking over your shoulder, you see Sheila laying next to you silently breathing, deep in sleep. Suddenly the events from the previous day come back to you. Listening closer you begin to hear the tell tale sounds of rain hitting the roof of the farmhouse. Must be a storm rolling in, you thought to yourself. You lay on your side for what feels like another hour embraced by this strange wolfess who for all you knew could still be hiding something. You definitely felt worried that this was all just a ploy to capture you or lead you to a trap of some kind, good kisser or not. If someone would have told yourself  4 months ago that you would be laying with a wolf woman in an abandoned home the middle of Illinois, you would have thought they\u2019d been high on PCP or some other bull crap; but no, Here you are separated from your unit and trusting this thing who\u2019s kind had just been trying to kill, convert or whatever they do to you. However the memory of her actions from last night saving you from that encounter with the coyote did naw at the back of your head. For all your grievances towards these anthros, Sheila showed not obvious signs of betraying the trust you two had. \t\t\t<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nRolling towards the edge of the bed, you manage to escape Sheila\u2019s arms, though the wolfess begins to quietly whine, however still out of it to do anything. After getting up and checking the time you see that it's around 10:34 am. Reaching into your bag you pull out a change of clothes you had managed to take with you during your escape from Springfield. \u201cGod have mercy on those who didn\u2019t make it out\u201d you quietly mumble to yourself as you put on your field jacket and pants. You decided to leave your rig next to your backpack at the foot of the bed. However, as to not have a repeat of last night, you took your handgun and rifle with you downstairs. Heading down the stairs you reached the kitchen and managed to flick on the light. Thank god for whatever backup power system this place had you noted as you went for the fridge and grabbed the rest of the bacon in the fridge and grabbed a few eggs to cook. Who ever owned this place must have left recently as even the eggs still seemed to be good to eat.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nTurning on the gas stove you begin to fry the bacon and eggs. Looking out the nearby window you see the gray storm clouds rolling across the sky with small pockets of light breaking through. Hopefully this would mean the storm would quickly roll on through so you could continue his journey east. As you began to plate the eggs and bacon you quickly realized you should probably make a plate for Sheila, since you knew damn well she smelt the bacon cook and would want it. Sure enough you began to hear commotion upstairs. Quickly dividing the food onto two plates, making sure hers had more of the bacon to compensate for the amount of food you had cooked for yourself. As you finished you soon saw a gray and white muzzle and yellow eyes pear around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChris? You're still here? I\u201d Sheila began to say as you put the plates of food on the small kitchen table in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf Course, my stuff was still upstairs wasn\u2019t it?\u201d you rhetorically ask. You see her face shift from surprise to relief. \u201cYeah\u2026. I just thought that maybe you had...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeft without saying goodbye?\u201d you replied as she came over the table and sat down at the table. You quickly notice that it's a tiny bit awkward for her to sit due to her digitigrade legs and size. Getting a better view from yesterday you guessed she was taller than you by at least a foot, which put her at about 7\u2019 , being 6\u2019 yourself. \u201cHow could I do that after your help last night?\u201d you retort with a light chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.. I\u2019m just glad you're alright\u201d Sheila replies before taking a bit of the food. \u201cThanks for the food, you didn\u2019t have to do this you know\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, you thought to return the favor again\u201d You replied as you continued to eat your food. You and Sheila begin talking about each other a bit more and about recent \u201cevents\u201d over the past few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you're not some wolf tuned human?\u201d You ask, just finding out that Sheila wasn\u2019t a normal wolf before she turned. Sheila looked down at her near empty plate, with a look of distraught before replying, \u201cNo, I know I must have been human before, I woke up in the middle of the street with stuff and people strewn all around me. I saw others turn as well, this one girl next to me turned into a wolf as well. It was something in the air doing it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPart of the terrorist attack I assume\u201d You quickly reply knowing all too well about how she turned. Sheila gave a quick questioning look, pushing you to describe it more. Sighing, you continue, \u201cAt first we thought this was some big chemical leak in Chicago, but after we pulled out we learned that this shit happened nationwide. Turns out somehow one of these radical animal rights groups managed to get into some government lab and take whatever the stuff is that turned you and others into these\u2026 creatures\u201d You say before quickly seeing Sheila take the last part of your sentence a bit harshly. \u201cOh shit, don\u2019t take that the wrong way, I just was trying to explain things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChris it's fine, I know what I am,\u201d She said trying to put on a tough smile, though her eyes betrayed her. \u201cI\u2019m some kind of science experiment gone wrong and now I am a freak\u201d She managed to say before breaking down completely. Quickly you get up and try to comfort her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY, Hey\u2026 Sheila it's alright. Look I'm sorry, you're not some kind of creature of freak\u201d You told her as she quickly buried her head into your neck and pulled you in close, continuing to cry. \u201cSheila you're more than that, I know because when you had the opportunity to act like one, you didn\u2019t, remember ?\u201d You continue to rub her head and fur, which thankfully calmed her down. She pulled away, giving you a view of her tear soaked eyes. God if this all a ploy from her this was very convincing. Deep down however you now could tell this girl wasn\u2019t trying to pull anything on you. You put up a small smile at her, before you both pull back in another hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Sniff.. Thanks Chris, that means a lot\u201d she said, her voice a lot less shaky than before. \u201cIt's just that I don\u2019t remember who I was before all this..\u201d She says still holding onto you. \u201cI know my name, but I don\u2019t remember anything from before the change. I was so lost and scared. I tried joining up with others like me, but I couldn\u2019t even hurt a human when they did so easily.\u201d She slowly began to calm down. \u201cChris, I don\u2019t want to be like them, I don\u2019t want to be an animal\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSheila you're not\u201d you quickly responded and pulled her from your chest and looked her dead in the eyes. \u201cSheila, I may only have known you for a day, but I can tell you aren't like the others. And when I come to who you were before, we can figure that out together.\u201d Sheila quickly stood up and lifted you into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Chris! I know we didn\u2019t get off on the best of terms, but knowing you're there for me means a lot. I\u2019ll be there for you as well\u201d She replied much more happier than before. After a few more seconds she sat you back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Having a big strong wolfess to watch your back could come in handy. You may be hesitant, but you sure do have the strength to do a number on anyone who wrongs you.\u201d You chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr anyone who hurts you.\u201d She quickly replied, still smiling looking at you. Maybe you were putting your guard down too fast and becoming too trusting of her, but screw it, You need the companionship after being alone for the past couple of weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning the table, you made your way upstairs to grab the remainder of your gear before leaving. Sheila followed you as well, filling the time between packing up with small talk and questions. After getting your rig and pack on and checking your weapons you turned to Sheila, now noticing an important detail; especially if she was to travel with you, She was naked. That was nothing surprising as most anthro wore little clothing from what you had seen, with many already having fur, they probably saw no need for the stuff. Bringing the point up to Sheila, she quickly realized the awkwardness and apologized. Thankfully there were some clothes in the room that managed to fit her. With a basic pair of shorts and shirt and jacket, your worry was resolved. With that you both went and did a last sweep of the house for anything useful to take with you. You managed to find some basic medical supplies in the bathroom as well as some matches and multitool in the garage. Sadly there wasn\u2019t a vehicle of any kind, so you\u2019d both be walking for some distance. Meeting up with Sheila outside the home you began to walk down the long driveway, heading eastward according to your compass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill don\u2019t understand how you can be comfortable in all that gear and clothing. This stuff is already feeling a bit stuffy\u201d Sheila began to complain as you both walked. You laughed a bit and saw her cute annoyance over the clothes she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, no fur remember?\u201d You say rubbing your arm at her. \u201cAnd plus, If we run into any humans I will have a much better time trying to explain that you're no threat if you at least don\u2019t look like others who don\u2019t wear a thing.\u201d With your explanation, Sheila rolled her eyes and went back to walking. Truth be told it was more so for your benefit, though she was a wolfess, her naked and well toned womanly figure wasn\u2019t something you wanted to be distracted by as you traveled together. Walking along the dirt road in between the fields of corn and grain as far as you could see. You hoped you\u2019d find a main road soon and hoped for a mode of transportation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Which began with making sure she was looking her very best, seated in front of the massive oaken dresser table, one of her half-dozen human slaves standing one step beside and behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight-brown scales with darker patterns cleaned and polished to a shine.  Needle-sharp teeth scrubbed free of unwanted bits of food and build-up.  Now it was time to set her jewellery.  A golden chain, many circled linked together to rest atop her shoulders and over her hefty breasts, their darker areola and nipples very smooth compared to her sleek scales.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatching gold ankle and wrist bracers, patterned with waves, adding to this was a metal waistband made to the same golden hue as the rest of what she wore, an emerald gem it in its front-centre to add contrast.  Same-coloured one-inch heels were slipped on next, barely enough to cover the toes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finished with a white silken headdress that sat on her bald head, thicker padding supporting it on the shoulders, while allowing the fabric to rest just beneath the shoulders plates along the back, and two small bangs to hang in front, gold patterns of snakes adorning it, with an emerald gem pattern etched into the top of the front.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me, do I not look beautiful?\u201d  Kareena queried her attendant slave, her preparation complete as she rose and turned to face her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mistress, you are beautiful.\u201d  She replied dutifully, eyes kept downwards.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d  Kareena cast her slitted eyes over her favoured slave, searching for any sign of imperfection on her body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cool scaled hand would run across parts of her during her inspection, checking for signs of growth of unwanted body hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll pass.\u201d  Kareena concluded her inspection and beckoned for her slave to follow her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at six feet, Kareena\u2019s appearance was about normal these days.  A mix of human and snake - in this instance a boa constrictor - with the body and build of a human, though the head and scales of a serpent.  Granted, she did have a nose, albeit one that was very wide and splayed relative to a human one, and was effectively fused to her upper jaw.  Massive FF Breasts standing out on her slim build that hid the strength of her sinewy body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other now-normal feature was her lack of any real clothing.  Since she and her others had come, few had taken to wearing them, though she was one of many who loved to accessorise - even if her evening plans required adding snap-points in her waistband to let it fly free when the time came.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Kareena herself really didn\u2019t like her slaves wearing more than herself, so it came as no surprise that the identifying slave-collar was all her attendant one had on herself, a chain attached to it to allow Kareena to keep her close.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the front doors of the twenty en-suite bedroom of her three-story mansion - a small perk of being the Governess of this Territory - she passed by the other slaves she held, three female, two male, all waiting for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I am gone, I expect you all to remain busy with your assigned duties.  They will all be complete when I return.\u201d  Karenna commended them, her tone alone enough for them to know she would broke no excuse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Mistress.\u201d  They answered in unison, which she acknowledged with a small nod before exiting the building.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for her was her only paid employee.  Laurenna, a thickly muscled black-furred wolf anthro clad in drivers\u2019 knee-high boots and elbow-length drivers\u2019 gloves, plus a drivers\u2019 cap that she tipped respectfully to her employer, the rear door of the vehicle held open for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSending her slave in first, Kareena followed, settling herself in the lush, smooth fabric seat while Laurenna jogged round to the drivers side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoverness Kareena,\u201d  Laurenna being in her employ allowing her to refer to Kareena by title and name.  \u201cWhere is it you\u2019re going?\u201d  </div></span></div></div>",
