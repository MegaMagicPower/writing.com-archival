You are about four-foot-eight inches tall, you have short black hair and brown eyes, and you're about average-looking. Your friends call you Jax for short. So far, your life has been very \"normal\" up till now. You always get up early, go to school, come home and you do your homework. You play soccer and tennis after school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning, things are different. You walk into the classroom where Ms. Vanderveld teaches third grade class. You sit all the way in the back of the room, next to your best friend, who is the same age as you, a short, blond boy who goes by the name of Zander Kane. You've known Zander since Kindergarten which is easy to explain since he lives right next door to you as well. Not only that, but Zander has been training karate since age six and he's gotten very good at it. He's your video game partner and protector in school, who always bails you out if you get in trouble. Nobody picks on you when Zander's around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou like to sit in the back of the classroom because that lets you look out the windows now and then. The classroom was facing the street and the playground, so it gives you a great view of what\u2019s going on outside. You just need to look outside when Mrs. Vanderveld isn\u2019t paying attention to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you glance outside, you spot two men walking on the playground outside. They are quite far way, but for some odd reason; you can hear their voices clearly. You hear their entire conversation. It seems like they are talking about the weather and the traffic being so heavy this morning. It just seemed odd to you that you can hear them so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother man in a nice suit approaches them. The man is carrying a black suitcase. As you stare at the suitcase, for a brief moment, the suitcase becomes transparent and you see papers and pens neatly stored inside of the suitcase, which the man is holding by its handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What the heck? I\u2019m seeing and hearing things?\u201d you  whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Jax!\u201d Zander says to you. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude\u2026 Can you hear what those guys are saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 They\u2019re too far away!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over and then you look back at your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird\u2026\u201d you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Zander asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can hear every word they\u2019re saying!\u201d you whisper back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares at you in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZander! Jaxxon! Please pay attention to class!\u201d Mrs. Vanderveld says to both you and Zander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly turn around and listen to the teacher, knowing that you\u2019ll have something to discuss with your friend during recess\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have a short brown hair with spikes at the front and you looked short at 4'2 and looked thin at 72lbs.  He had a thought like being small because of some people he had treated him like a small-fry if you will and he was upset by the ways it got to him in his life.  He was a normal 9 year old as anyone would see him, that is until one day of that morning when you decided to have some time in the park for some fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt down recently because of last year.  You was at the summer camp where he was with your friend for a five night camping at the lodge.  On the final night, everyone was asleep but you when you went to get some water, which is situated  from outside beside the lodge.  You was about to get back in when you saw a light shining thing brightened all over you, and you have no idea why he was targeted in the first place?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light disappeared from you, you started to feel tingling all over your body and you had no idea what was going on.  Despite this, it only stopped for a while and it continued to do the same feeling to this day.  You have absolute no idea why though and decided that despite it was an extraordinary experience, he kept this as a secret and you didn't want to tell the others, but act normal as you could to try and forget about the events it took place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you walked through to find a seat, you suddenly got bumped onto a person and looked up to realise it was his bullies they've treated you so badly and a smile from their faces, including a leader named, BJ Hicks, aged eleven will tell you the whole story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, look who's that shrimp looking brat that just comes out and bumped into me?\"  BJ asked with a smirk and looked down onto you in fear when you take your reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S..s..sorry, I didn't mean to do this to you.\"  You apologise, but an apology would mean nothing to neither one of those bullies and BJ wanted to take his task which he normally does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?  Well, I think we should teach that small fry a lesson, shall we lads?\"  BJ asked in command and his friends laughed quickly before they watch to see him taking a beating on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to put an anguish look on your face and tried to be a tough kid, but the size comparison would be impossible to match or bigger if he would wish to happen.  However, when BJ got close to you, you're getting the same feeling again and all of this wan't helping.  That is until when he feels his clothes were suddenly getting tighter than normal.  You don't know why, but the expression from BJ's face and the rest, turns from smirk to fear and BJ stepped to look of the horror as to wondering why they looked feared than he expected?  That's when he looked down and realised that he was actually getting bigger.  Not only if he was getting taller, but he was also getting fatter as well and he had no idea why is it happening to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shadow was then cast above the bullies as it only took for moments before he grew up to 10 feet tall and your body looked absolute obese.  Your belly was hanging over your mighty thighs that it and your butt was getting wider like a size of two pairs of beach volleyballs and the others have all grown fat as well and looking down at the bullies on horror for the first time, made him feel shocked, but then a big smirk have started to shown on his face and now, he wants to take this revenge at last.  But how does he wanted to treat a bully a lesson?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A smirk on his face as he stared down and two of the bullies BJ was with, decided to take a hike and ran off, leaving the leader all on his own in pretty much embarrass.  But you'll have no problem on having a go on him and BJ knows it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just you and me now, shorty!\"  You laughed to return the insult favour on him, as he quickly grabbed his shirt with two hands before he makes a strength by lifting him off the ground, so he wanted to teach him a lesson or two and that smirk was all the story you react from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, I getting sick of you insulting and beating me up all the time.  So I suggest you're going to apologise to me, right now!  Or else, I'll make a huge deal on you?\"  You said in tough words and that made BJ shaken in fear and with that, he quickly nodded his head and quickly tired to apologise everything he did was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm sorry!  All I did was wrong, I swear to death!  Just please, let me go for me!\"  He begged and an apology had been said,  you just smirked all the way through as now, he has to think weather or not should he let him go free or face a consequences? </span></div></div>",

Only - they weren't known. Nobody ever found the vault, and but for a highly secret passage in the obscure cave, even the outer concealed door was inaccessible. Though of course, the group's evil aims necessitated such security arrangements, especially on the occasion of their annual general meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Dark Alliance is stronger than ever\" hissed a man known only as the Agent \"We have now infiltrated the world's major economic and political systems, as well as most of the major social influencers. Operation codename 'take over the world' is going smoothly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Operation risks remain\" the Secretary reminded him \"We must be careful to stick to the plan and not become complacent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed\" replied the Agent \"I don't plan to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is not a man or woman, boy or girl in this world who can stop us now\" laughed the Chief softly, fingering a small stone in his hand \"Soon, the entire world shall be under my command!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in a small town some distance away, three girls, best friends, all aged 11, were walking home together after a Girl Guides meeting. The school year was almost at an end and holiday fever was already gripping the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keen to hang out at the mall this afternoon?\" asked Jessica.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're all going!\" chimed in Sophie \"Come on, it'll be fun.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry girls\" replied Eve \"I've got soccer practice.\"<br>\r\nJessica shrugged. \"Suit yourself\" she sighed.<br>\r\n\"Why do you even play soccer?\" asked Sophie \"It's such a boy's sport.\"<br>\r\n\"You're just jealous that I get all the boys\" laughed Eve.<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" replied Sophie, rolling her eyes \"You probably think you get all the boys just because you play in a mixed team.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you all about how it was when you get back from practice\" offered Jessica \"That way you won't need to miss out on anything.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds great, thanks!\" replied Eve cheerfully \"When will I next see you?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, we've got school tomorrow, but I can call you tonight\" added Jessica.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah - last week of school!\" cheered Sophie \"High five girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls high fived each other and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is my house\" said Eve.<br>\r\n\"You live in that run down old thing?\" asked Sophie.<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" said Eve \"It's a bit of a shack but my mom can't afford much else.\"<br>\r\nSophie shrugged. \"It's fine\" she winked \"You should have a sleepover at my house sometime though.\"<br>\r\nEve smiled. Sophie's family were known for being quite wealthy.<br>\r\n\"Best friend hug\" called Jessica, and the three girls engaged in their ritual hug that they always did when they left each other, before Eve left them to go inside her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the spare key under the rock where it always was, Eve walked inside and noticed that her single mother still wasn't home from work. She had to work several jobs to support the family, which left Eve alone around the house most of the time. Eve didn't mind though. It meant that she could always go off and have fun adventures that other girls couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDashing quickly to her bedroom as soon as she came inside, she drew the curtains and started to get changed into her soccer gear... a tattered old second-hand set of boots, shin guards and green uniform. Then, she went to the bathroom to tie up her long blonde hair, noticing that it felt unusually smooth. Looking in the mirror, she noticed not only that her hair was shinier than it was before, but her brilliant green eyes were too. She leaned up close to the small mirror that stood above the sink to try and get a better view of her eyes and how they seemed to gleam in the artificial bathroom light, when suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve found herself looking right through the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a brief scream of shock, Eve jumped backwards and fell on to the bathroom floor. For a moment, she had been sure, she had seen beyond the exterior wall of her house and to the lawn outside beyond the bathroom. Yet now, breathing heavily, the wall was solid as it ever was. She cautiously got up and tapped the wall to be sure. Indeed - no question about it - nothing was different about the wall at all. Eve looked around, wondering if it was some kind of a fluke. Once again, she cautiously tried to look beyond the wall, experimentally trying to focus just a little bit beyond where the mirror was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, but surely, the wall blurred away from her vision, and Eve found herself looking right through the wall. Eve put forward her hand again to feel that the wall was still solid - and it was. She was looking through the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...\" she whispered to herself as she considered how cool that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to test the power just a little bit further, she decided to try to look through other walls, doing a full scan of her house. Sure enough, she found herself able to look into any given room. She started to notice that faraway or thicker walls were more difficult for her to focus through, but it wasn't really a trouble at all. She even looked inside the walls and amused herself for a moment with following the plumbing and wiring of her house around. She tried looking through her own clothes, into a cactus plant that her mother had in the bathroom... going back to her room, she discovered she could even read pages from a book merely by looking at the cover with a bit of practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing\" she said as she refocused back on to her normal room \"I've got to tell Jess and Sophie about this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment she wasn't sure where she'd left her cellphone but, using her new power, quickly found it lying around in the living room after another quick scan around the house. She happily skipped to the living room, finding the cellphone exactly where she'd seen it. Picking it up, she relished the opportunity to take a look at all the little circuits inside her cellphone with a giggle, before refocusing to look at her screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the time!?\" she shouted as she looked at the little clock on her phone \"Looks like I must have gotten carried away with all this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning towards the park where she practiced, she squinted as hard as she could to see that her team mates had already started arriving. Wasting little time, she started to run out of the house, before remembering that she still had to put the key back and still do up her hair. With another quick scan to remind herself where she'd left it, she hid the key, did her hair, locked the door, and started running down the street to get to practice. \"Coach is going to be so annoyed at me when I'm late\" she said to herself as she ran.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eve arrived at the park and found that she wasn't actually as late as she thought she would be. In addition, even though she thought she had been running pretty fast, she didn't feel tired at all. In fact, she felt already warmed up and ready for practice. For the most part, though, Eve had been too distracted with playing with her new power to notice anything unusual about that. It had been fun seeing inside everybody's homes as she had run past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Bricks blew his whistle and all the nine boys and five girls stood to attention. \"Alright, we're all here, we can start now!\" he bellowed \"Warm up exercises everyone! Copy all these stretches as I do them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a collective groan, the whole team stood around and started copying the coach's stretches. Eve got bored quickly, as her body seemed already more than warmed up. Soon enough she'd looked through everything nearby, and as bursting as she was to tell everyone about her power, she also knew better than to interrupt the coach. Coach Bricks hated it when people interrupted him. He was a good coach though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, ball skills!\" yelled the coach, blowing his whistle again \"Everybody, I want you to get a ball out of that bag over there, and dribble it across the pitch and back, staying in line with the rest of the team. Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again all the kids got moving on the coach's command. As Eve dribbled her ball across the pitch, she noticed that her teammates seemed slower than she remembered them. Soon her mind was wandering again, as she wondered what Jess and Sophie were up to at the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, very softly at first but increasingly clearly, she heard some voices in the distance. It was Jessica and Sophie!<br>\r\n\"Wow, check out that shirt!\" Jessica was saying excitedly.<br>\r\n\"Told you this store was the best\" replied Sophie.<br>\r\n\"This shirt is totally rad. I wish I could buy it.\" continued Jessica, a little more sadly.<br>\r\n\"You want this shirt?\" said Sophie, and Eve could practically hear her pulling out her designer wallet.<br>\r\n\"Well, actually I was thinking this one will look good on Eve\" responded Jessica nervously.<br>\r\nSophie laughed. \"Yeah it would! I'll get it for her, no problem. She'll love it!\"<br>\r\n\"Must be nice to be able to walk around with a huge wad of cash like you always do...\" muttered Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve got excited. Was she really hearing what her friends were up to? There was no way that could be possible - could it? Because that would be amazing. Eve supposed there was only one way to check. Using her new vision powers, she turned her head in the direction of the store and focused really hard to see if she could catch a glimpse of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was snapped out of it in a flash by the blow of the coach's whistle. \"Eve!\" bellowed Coach Bricks \"Come back here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Eve realized that she'd lost her concentration, being too wrapped up in using her powers, and had jogged with the ball all the way to the other side of the field, far beyond the pitch. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!\" she repeated as she ran back to her teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, you're acting strange today. You're never usually late to practice and when I say you should run with the group, I mean that you should run with the group. Is that clear?\" asked the Coach.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, coach. I'm sorry coach.\" muffled Eve, a little dejectedly, and making a mental note to try not to use her new powers too much. Still, she was incredibly curious as to whether she had actually heard her friends or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Eve, you're usually good, so I'll let you off with a warning\" said the coach \"Don't let that happen again. In the game of soccer, you have to keep your eyes on the ball and know what's happening around you at all times.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry coach\" continued Eve \"I promise, this will really be the last time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agent and the secretary flew back together on a top-secret private jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The chief was looking chipper\" remarked the agent.<br>\r\n\"Don't get complacent\" warned the secretary \"who knows, a superhero could arise a wreck our plans.\"<br>\r\nThe agent laughed. \"You've been watching too many movies. Superheroes aren't real! They're scientifically impossible. In reality, we evildoers can do whatever we like, whenever we like. It's just one of the perks of being a bad guy.\"<br>\r\nThe secretary shrugged and turned a cold shoulder to the agent. \"Don't get complacent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as practice was over, Eve started going back home. She couldn't wait to see if she had super hearing now as well. Of course she no longer was sure where her friends were, as no matter how hard she listened she could no longer hear them, although she could hear other voices and other conversations quite clearly. In fact at one point she was even sure she could hear the radio waves in the air if she focused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued her walk home thinking that it might be weird if she moved her head around looking for her friends in all directions, but that she could practice looking through things a little bit again. She started practicing on mailboxes, trying to quickly read people's mail as she passed. She giggled as she read a love note from somebody's sweetheart. It started to annoy her reading all the junk mail around the neighbourhood though. For some reason she'd assumed that only her family got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she practiced her power, she noticed that she wasn't just focusing through things - she was actually instinctively focusing in on things. It dawned on her that her eyes actually had no problem seeing faraway things in minute detail, as though they were extremely powerful telescopes. She had no trouble zooming even further in, she realized, first seeing the individual ink drops on a certain letter, and then zooming in further to see individual bacteria crawling around on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she suddenly bumped into a lampost. It didn't hurt at all but it probably looked silly.<br>\r\n\"Watch where you're going!\" called an old lady across the street.<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Eve called back. She REALLY had to stop over-using her powers, difficult though that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived home, she rapidly found the hidden spare key and dashed inside, finding her cellphone where she'd left it. In a flash she called up Jessie.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jessie here\"<br>\r\n\"Hey Jessie, it's Eve. How was the shopping trip?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, you will NOT believe what we found!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah - well you won't believe what I've discovered either. Did you find me a new shirt?\"<br>\r\n\"What? How did you know?\"<br>\r\n\"Did Sophie pay for the shirt?\"<br>\r\n\"Well of course, yeah... but honestly, how did you know we got you a shirt?\"<br>\r\n\"I heard you as you bought it.\"<br>\r\n\"What? Were you stalking us in the store or something? That's so creepy!\"<br>\r\n\"No no! It isn't like that, see, I've been developing these powers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Eve started to explain to Jessica everything.</span></div></div>",

She was still wearing the same clothes as before, but Eve saw Jessica change her socks, from white socks to cute pink ones. Jessica then practically hopped into her bathroom, where she whispered \"Eve's powers are amazing\" and went back to the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still there?\" asked Jessica.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You said my powers were amazing, and you changed into your pink socks.\"<br>\r\n\"Woah! That's... unbelievable! You don't have cameras all around my house or something?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not. I'm amazed too. Want me to try again wearing a blindfold and earmuffs?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" said Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve ran to the garage where her mother kept various tools, and put on both a blindfold and earmuffs, adjusting each to fit her smaller head.<br>\r\n\"Go\" she said into her cellphone, having no problem at all focusing on Jessica.<br>\r\nJessica this time went to the other room first, whispered that the shirt she had gotten for Eve was in the upper drawer of her cabinet of her room, and went back to change. Eve, immediately distracted, looked at the drawer to find an awesome \"World's Best Friend\" shirt lying there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica!\" exclaimed Eve \"You told me where the shirt was, you put on your green hat, but wow, that shirt is amazing!\"<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" smiled Jessica \"I knew you'd like it. I'll bring it with me to school tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n\"I can't wait!\" replied Eve \"Thank you so, so, so, so, so, so much!\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll see you tomorrow then!\"<br>\r\n\"Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve removed her blindfold and earmuffs just as her mother pulled into the garage. \"Hi Mom!\" she said excitedly as her mother opened the car door.<br>\r\n\"Hey Eve\" was her mother's reply \"You look different.\"<br>\r\n\"Different? How?\"<br>\r\nHer mother paused for a moment. \"I can't really place it. You're more radiant, somehow. Like you've just had a makeover or at least a facial or something.\"<br>\r\n\"No\" smiled Eve, though she vaguely remembered how that had been what had alerted her to her powers in the first place \"But I've found something way cooler.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh really? What?\"<br>\r\n\"You're not going to believe this!\"<br>\r\n\"Try me.\"<br>\r\n\"Mom, I... I've got super powers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother's reaction was somewhat unexpected. She quickly picked Eve up and hugged her really tightly. Eve also needed no powers to see her mother let out a tear from her eye.<br>\r\n\"That's so cool\" whispered her mother.<br>\r\n\"I know\" whispered Eve back.<br>\r\n\"You're finally growing up\" replied her mother, letting her down out of the hug \"There's some grocery in the back seat, could you carry it in for me please sweetie?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" replied Eve, quick to go past her mother to get the shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me all about it!\" said her mother full of excitement, and she listened to Eve's story as Eve started putting away the groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eve was finished, her mother was still filled with joy. \"Do you know why you're getting these powers?\" she asked Eve.<br>\r\nEve crashed on the couch, taking off her shin guards. \"No. Do you?\"<br>\r\n\"Well - yes. I knew this would happen one day around now.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" replied Eve, sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You know, your father didn't really die. He was an alien. There was a great spaceship passing by and he fell in love and sort of ... abducted me. He was amazingly good looking though. Just like an impossibly hot guy. Got me pregnant instantly. Apparently he was also an alien scientist. Humans and aliens both have their individual weaknesses, but he theorized that when combined, the child would eventually develop basically unlimited power.\"<br>\r\n\"Unlimited?\"<br>\r\n\"That's right. You'll find your powers will naturally grow rapidly over the next few years. But with training you can get them faster and practice controlling them better. Your instinct is to use your powers all the time, and that's because your body is just getting used to them. Here - I got you this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother went down to the boot of her car to reveal a hidden compartment that Eve had never noticed before. Inside was a white and silver spandex costume with a giant silver E on the front.<br>\r\n\"A superhero costume?\" asked Eve.<br>\r\n\"Do you want it?\" asked her mother in reply \"You're going to be Eve - Protector of the Universe. You'll probably want a costume to match that. It's also really stretchy so it'll grow as you get older.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes please!\" replied Eve \"Can I try it on?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" replied her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve wasted no time in taking the costume and running to her room with it. She quickly disrobed out of her soccer gear and put on her new skin-tight costume. It felt great - light and comfortable. She also liked how it seemed to shine out in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels great\" she said as she modelled the costume for her mother back in the living room \"How do I look?\"<br>\r\n\"You look awesome\" said her mother, almost laughing with pride \"Here - there are some silver boots for your feet as well.\"<br>\r\n\"You're the best mom!\" replied Eve, running over and slipping on the boots, which fit her feet perfectly \"How did you afford all this?\"<br>\r\n\"I've been saving up for years. That's why I've never had enough money for the house and things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve smiled at her mother full of love, and she smiled back. Eve couldn't believe her mother would do something like that for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, mom - how come the costume stops right here on my chest?\" asked Eve.<br>\r\nHer mother laughed. \"That'll make more sense when you're older, sweetheart. Powers aren't the only thing you'll be developing over the next few years, but I'm sure you will have learnt all about puberty in school already. You'll probably be absurdly hot in no time, so you might as well show it off.\"<br>\r\n\"Eww\" replied Eve, to the further laughter of her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExperimentally, Eve decided to try some handstands and a few other gymnastic moves that she'd learnt in school in her new costume, to get used to the feeling. \"So mom\" she said as she tried a cartwheel, carefully not damaging anything \"Do my powers have any weaknesses? Like, Superman has Kryptonite or something.\"<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" said her mother nervously \"Well, yeah, one, but it's very rare.\"<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Eve, now doing a spider crawl.<br>\r\n\"Yttrium orthophosphate\"<br>\r\nEve stood up, looking quizzically at her mother. \"Come again?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"It's usually called Zenotime for short\" replied her mother \"It's a very rare kind of rock. Sometimes you can cut it into gemstones though. For some random reason that one specific compound is something you're allergic to, so you'll probably want to avoid it.\"<br>\r\n\"How does it affect my powers?\" asked Eve, bouncing back on to the couch in her shining new spandex costume.<br>\r\n\"Basically your powers get weaker as you get closer to it\" replied her mother again \"As I said, it's very rare, and nobody else knows about it. Your father told me just before he left, actually. Anyway, Xenotime sort of black, you'll feel it when you get near it. Like a sort of overall weakening feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve's ears perked up. \"Why did my father have to go away?\"<br>\r\nHer mother sighed. \"Other aliens didn't approve of the relationship. They didn't know I was pregnant though. He put me back to earth, sailed away in his starship, and I never saw or heard of him again.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh\" said Eve, fidgeting. She wasn't sure why she felt like moving around so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" said her mother \"I think it's just about time that I made dinner. After that, I think we should get started with your training!\"<br>\r\n\"Training?\"<br>\r\n\"For your powers, sweetie! I hear the crime rate is at an all time high, so we've got no time to lose.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eve went back to the bathroom to check herself out while her mother cooked up some dinner. She was sort of hungry after a really exciting day. When she got to the bathroom, she found that her mother wasn't lying - her appearance had changed again ever so slightly. She definitely looked a lot better now than she had before. She did a quick twirl to see how her costume looked from all sides and was suitably impressed. Of course she was extremely excited for school tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bored, Eve decided to see if she could use her super hearing to tune in to the radio again. With a little concentration, she soon managed to find one of the local news stations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chaos in the streets of the capital right now as reports are flooding in that the president has been assassinated. Authorities are urging civilians not to panic and to remain calm. We are yet to receive official confirmation of the president's condition but it is believed at least four shots were fired at point blank range while the president was apparently alone in his office. Officials were, however, able to rule out to us suicide as a possibility. No group has as yet claimed responsibility, and it is not believed there was prior warning of the attack at this stage. As investigations continue authorities are warning people against nonessential travel as roads have been full ever since the story first broke...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit\" whispered Eve to herself. She'd forgotten that being a hero and all would actually require her to be brave. The president was shot? He was the most guarded person in the world. If that could happen to him then... what could happen to her? For a moment, it seemed almost too risky a profession, even if she did develop practically unlimited powers eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraining her eyes, she decided to look at the capital to see if she could find where the president was killed. This took a lot of effort. Her eyes were quite painful when she finally did manage to focus on the room, but what was more painful was the shock. There was the president, surrounded by doctors and other medical staff, and around that were a bunch of secret service security guards carrying heavy weapons. She listened in and heard them say various medical words to each other that she didn't understand. The president was now in the foyer of his house, but from the trail of blood it looked like he had been moved there. Eve followed the trail to the president's office. She also looked around and saw an ambulance approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she suddenly saw something. It was a young man dressed in dark clothes, walking away from the direction of the scene and carrying a handily concealed gun. Eve looked inside the barrel and noted that the gun was loaded, but still looked hot, as if it had been fired recently...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's got to be the killer\" she whispered to herself again. She couldn't believe it, but it slowly dawned on her what her powers could do to help people. Suddenly all her lack of courage went right out of the window and she went down to her mother, determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! The president's been shot. I heard it on the radio!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh\" came her mother's reply, not as surprised as Eve would have thought \"Yeah, the crime rate is pretty bad.\"<br>\r\n\"Mom, I have to go to the capital immediately! I know who killed him!\"<br>\r\n\"Do you really know who killed him, or did you just see somebody with a gun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve stopped. \"How did you know?\"<br>\r\nHer mother smiled in response. \"You've been acting a bit impulsive today, so I just figured it out. You can't just use your powers to accuse just anybody of anything. You have to be a bit smarter about it. This is going to be an important lesson, ok? Don't assume that somebody is guilty. Look at all the evidence, and consider all the options. We're not going to the capital until your powers are a little more developed.\"<br>\r\nEve sighed but understood. Her mother was right, as usual.<br>\r\n\"In my opinion\" continued her mother \"It was probably one of the secret service, and he might have been chasing the killer himself. For all you know anyway. Perhaps reporting him would make things even worse. You're a superhero now, Eve. You have to take all of that into consideration. Focus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Eve sighed and strained her eyes in the direction of the capital, hoping to get a more holistic picture of the situation. Her mother snapped her back to attention by gently touching her shoulder.<br>\r\n\"But don't focus right now, ok?\" she said with a smile \"Right now dinner's ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve went to the dining room to find a plate with three or four times her usual portion size sitting on a plate. \"Mom, you know I don't eat that much\" she said.<br>\r\n\"For the next little while, you'll want to\" replied her mother \"In fact I'm sorry I couldn't afford more food for you. Developing powers takes a lot of energy, so you'll need to fuel up properly.\"<br>\r\n\"But won't I get... sort of... fat?\"<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not. Your metabolism isn't like a normal human's. It's impossible for you to get fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve smiled as she dug in. She was quite hungry after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was the mission a success?\" asked the secretary on her encrypted secret phone.<br>\r\n\"Indeed\" came the agent's voice over the secure connection \"The president is dead.\"<br>\r\n\"Then we can begin phase two\" replied the secretary \"You know what to do?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course I do\" replied the agent, as the line crackled before going dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eve was finished eating the feast she found that her mother had once again been right - she had really been that hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to practice your powers?\" asked her mom.<br>\r\n\"Of course I am\" replied Eve happily \"What are we going to work on?\"<br>\r\n\"Well... you can look through things and see things far away, but you can't see something you're not looking at, right? Like, you can't see behind you yet without turning your head?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve tried it. She found that she could see a little further to the side than before, as she was looking through her own head, but without moving her head she definitely couldn't see all the way around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's work on that then\" continued her mother \"You should eventually be able to see in all directions at the same time - even see around corners and things - but that'll take a fair amount of practice. It's called omnivision.\"<br>\r\n\"And these powers will really develop faster if I practice them?\" asked Eve.<br>\r\n\"Yes\" replied her mother \"So it's good you've been curious enough to practice them a lot on your own. I want you to keep watching me, ok? Don't turn your head but see if you can keep following me as I go around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother stood up and started pacing around. After a moment, she went out of Eve's vision. \"Wait, stop\" said Eve \"I can't see you any more there, mom\"<br>\r\n\"Try it\" replied her mother \"Don't try to move your eyeballs either, just see if you can see me. It might help you to concentrate if you close your eyes, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve did as her mother instructed and closed her eyes, avoiding the strong temptation to look through her eyelids with her powers. She strained her mind, trying not just to imagine her mother standing there, but to actually see her without using her eyes at all. \"Mom, I... I can't do it\" she said \"I don't think I have this power yet.\"<br>\r\n\"That's fine\" said her mother encouragingly \"Just keep trying. It's good for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve kept focusing harder and harder. She tried clearing her head a little bit, putting all her effort towards this. Then, slowly, a blurry shadowy image of her mother began to form in her mind. She focused as hard as she could, trying to make that image as clear as possible before... suddenly it was gone. In frustration, Eve banged her fists down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately there was a loud noise and the table turned to sawdust, breaking plates and shattering cutlery across the floor. The very ground seemed to move a little. Some big shards of broken glass hit Eve's leg, but Eve barely even felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" asked Eve, looking around.<br>\r\n\"Careful\" warned Eve's mother \"You were building up a lot of power there, trying to get it to work, then you let it all out in anger on that table. Anger is a quick way to release your power, but it's very dangerous and unpredictable. Rarely does it do what you want it to. Never get angry or frustrated, especially when you're training, ok sweetheart?\"<br>\r\nEve looked down. \"I'm sorry mom\" she sobbed.<br>\r\n\"It's ok, I understand how hard it is\" replied her mother \"But you've got to learn a little self-control. Just focus on the task. Don't let yourself get frustrated when you fail.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes mom. I really didn't mean it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve's mother hugged her for a moment, before gently kissing her forehead. \"Let's try this again\" whispered her mother. Eve smiled and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Eve was more relaxed - she almost felt more ready. Again it hurt her mind a bit but she was more used to the feeling by now. She assumed it was related to experiencing the powers for the first time. Once again, with a lot of effort, the blurry figure of her mother slowly came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... doing it... mom\" she gasped as she concentrated as hard as she could. The image cleared more and more until eventually, Eve could see her mother as clearly as if she was looking right at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many fingers am I holding up?\" asked Eve's mother.<br>\r\n\"Three... now two... now five\" replied Eve proudly as Eve's mother paced around and tried holding up the fingers in different places. Slowly Eve was starting to be able to see not just her mother, but everything else around her as well, in every direction, just like her mother had said.</span></div></div>",

This proved tricky, but eventually she managed to see this as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done!\" called her mother, walking back into the dining area \"I'm so proud of you! You can open your eyes now.\"<br>\r\nEve smiled and opened her eyes, surprised at how much more she could see now. It was like she was able to look in every direction at the same time with much less effort when she had her eyes open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was amazing!\" she said \"Sorry about the table, though, mom.\"<br>\r\n\"That's ok, it's nothing to get worked up about\" replied her mother \"I'll handle it... somehow... Anyway, you did great.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom\" smiled Eve \"Is every training going to be this good? Am I going to get a new power with each training or something?\"<br>\r\n\"Well... no\" answered her mother \"This one was quite closely related to a different power you'd already developed naturally. Most of the time it'll be best just to practice the powers that you already have and to combine them in new ways. Also, I think you still have a lot to learn about the mental side of being a superhero, also with the law and such.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I have you to teach me\" said Eve, hugging her mother softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now... I think\" announced her mother \"It's time for bed, my little hero.\"<br>\r\n\"What!? But I'm not tired!\"<br>\r\n\"I know you've had a very exciting day, but every young hero needs their rest. Go on, get changed into your pyjamas, brush your teeth, and then I'll come and turn the lights off for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve pouted, then sighed and did as she was told. Behind her as she left, she noticed her mother smile and wink at her again, before blowing her a kiss. With her super hearing she could just hear her say a faint \"I love you\" as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached her room, Eve removed her boots and costume, enjoying the feeling of the tight spandex material coming off her skin. Her pyjamas, by contrast, seemed like giant sacks in that they were far more loose fitting and somewhat less comfortable to wear. It was almost like she wasn't a superhero any more, and had transformed back into a little girl again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she went to the bathroom. Opening her mouth she was greeted with two perfect rows of gleaming white teeth, far better than she had ever seen them look. Although she had teeth now to make any dentist jealous, she decided to listen to her mother's wishes anyway and brushed them thoroughly, making various superhero poses in the mirror as she did. After washing her face really quickly she sauntered back to her room, jumped into her cosy old bed (hearing it creak loudly as she hit it) and called her mother over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet dreams, sweetheart.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom. Good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother turned the light off and left. Suddenly, Eve's eyes adjusted to the darkness. She was impressed with both how quickly it happened, and how she could instantly see everything as clearly as if it was day, even in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temptation to play a little more with her powers grew stronger as she lay there. She began to wonder if she could practice her omnivision a little more to look around at everything as her mother had described. Closing her eyes again, she started trying to look at herself as though she was standing above herself. Trying to \"see\" from a different vantage point was again not the easiest thing but Eve kept straining and focusing on it. After a massive effort and no success, however, Eve sighed, letting her frustrations go quietly, and drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, Eve's first thought was that she must have grown overnight, because the ceiling was much closer. Suddenly realizing that her bed was no longer under her, however, she squealed with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Mom! Look! I'm levitating!\" she called.<br>\r\n\"That's nice dear\" called back her mother \"Come down for breakfast or you'll be late for school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve was in no rush, however. She started practicing as much as she could. She immediately tried floating just a little higher - it was slow, and really hard, but she managed to do it. Then she practiced lowering herself towards the ground, standing up proudly as her feet softly hit the bed. She did this a couple of times, trying to go up or down even faster each time she did. She found letting herself fall to be a great way to get down quickly but somehow she innately knew that with a bit of practice she could get down even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve, are you practicing your new power instead of getting ready again?\" called her mother.<br>\r\n\"Sorry mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve fell down, using her levitation power to soften the impact, and made for the bathroom. Here she undressed and had a quick shower, after which she dried herself off quickly and went back to her room's drawer. She was just about to change into some casual clothes when she saw her shining new superhero costume beside it. Already Eve was feeling strange not wearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" she called out \"Can I wear my new costume to school?\"<br>\r\n\"You can wear it wherever you like, sweetie. It's up to you! The material won't get dirty no matter how much you wear it, so it's fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping in the air for joy, Eve used her levitation power to allow herself to jump extra high and high-five the ceiling. \"Thanks mom\" she shouted as she put it back on. Strangely enough it felt great to her, like she was now a true superhero again. When her soft hero boots were at last fitted on her feet, she ran to the kitchen to find her mother had erected a new, makeshift table out of spare plywood in the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry again about the table\" sighed Eve, remembering how she had destroyed it in a fit of rage.<br>\r\n\"It's fine, really\" replied her mother, bringing a giant stack of pancakes to the table \"Eat up!\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm ever going to get used to eating this much.\"<br>\r\n\"There's extra cereal and bread in the cupboard if you like\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve ate up, and to her own surprise, was still hungry enough afterwards to chow through two bowls of cereal from the cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Eve, brush your teeth, I'll pack your bag for you, you've got to get a move on or you'll miss the bus.\"<br>\r\n\"But mom, my teeth look great! See?\"<br>\r\nEve opened her mouth, suitably impressing her mother. \"Wow Eve, you have been brushing. Now hurry up and brush them again.\"<br>\r\nNot wanting to disappoint her mother, Eve went off to the bathroom and brushed her teeth quickly, using her super vision to watch her mother pack her bag as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you be careful at school\" warned her mother \"Pay attention to the teacher and don't get sidetracked. Avoid showing off or just using your powers too much. And don't get too angry or frustrated about it either. I know you'll really want to use your powers as much as you can but you need to learn that self-control. Got it?\"<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" replied Eve after spitting out the toothpaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Eve was at the door, kissing her mom goodbye. \"I love you so much\" whispered her mother.<br>\r\n\"I love you too. Oh - hang on - would you like to see my levitation power?\"<br>\r\nHer mother smiled. \"Sure, but make it quick. The bus will be at the stop any moment now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to do it as fast as possible, Eve stepped outside and levitated up into the air, going a little higher than the roof of the house, before levitating back down as quickly as she could without using gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive\" said her mother \"I can't wait to hear how today goes. See you after school!\"<br>\r\n\"Goodbye!\" called Eve as she hurried off towards the bus stop.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eve waited alone at the bus stop as usual, in her sweet white and silver superhero costume. Though she didn't have to wait long, she still decided to use it as a chance to practice her powers. Any little moment alone, she thought, should be useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again she concentrated on trying to look at herself from the vantage point of across the street. Rather like the first time she had experienced her omnivision, a somewhat blurry picture actually began to form in her mind after some minutes of tough concentration, before she was jolted to attention by the sound of the bus driver stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's some fine costume you have on\" said the driver, eyeing her up \"You're looking good.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" replied Eve, climbing onboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she went towards the back of the bus where Jessica and Sophie were, a boy from her class, Percy, stood up and blocked her path. Percy was generally known as a meanie and a bully who often used intimidation to get what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, looks like it's now official\" said Percy, as he and the rest of the bus took a look at Eve's new figure \"You're a freak.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm a superhero now\" said Eve coldly \"Get out of my way, Percy.\"<br>\r\n\"What are you gonna do, freak? You're nothing but a delusional weirdo. What kind of powers do you even have?\"<br>\r\nEve shrugged. \"So far, I levitate, hear all, and see all. And maybe some other powers I haven't discovered yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this there was a general murmur of skepticism on the bus, so Eve levitated up in the air to prove her point. Everyone was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all you've got, freak?\" asked Percy \"What a faker you are, even wearing that lame stupid costume on. Who are you even trying to fool? It's not like you have a secret identity with that huge E written on the front. You should just go back to your home planet and leave us alone, weirdo.\"<br>\r\n\"You're probably just jealous\" countered Eve.<br>\r\n\"Why would I be jealous of a loser like you?\" threw in Percy.<br>\r\n\"Because I'm part alien with more power than you can ever dream of, maybe?\" said Eve. As soon as she said it, the bus went silent with shock. Eve drew a sharp breath and held her lips, immediately regretting her choice of words. \"I'm sorry\" she said quickly \"I didn't mean to suggest that I'm better than you, I just...\"<br>\r\n\"You're not better\" interjected Percy \"You're not like any of us here. You're not normal, and you're not wanted. You're a freak and nothing more. You don't belong in our school, or in our world. In fact, you don't belong at all. I for one - am pretty proud to be a human. A full-blooded, normal human. And my power is something you'll never have - the power of belonging. Though I suppose some outcast retarded freak like you wouldn't understand that.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, you kids sit down back there!\" yelled the bus driver before Eve could respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy sat back down on his seat, smirking at Eve. It took a lot of self control not to get angry and punch Percy right there and then, but Eve remembered her mother's words. Still, angry though it made Eve, it did hurt. She went to the back of the bus somewhat more down and dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry!\" said Jessica as Eve sat down beside her \"I was just telling Sophie about your powers, and then soon enough everyone wanted to hear about them. Percy just went too far. He's probably just insecure - don't worry about him. I didn't know about the suit though. That's pretty cool!\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" replied Eve, looking at her suit a little more self consciously \"It does look a bit over the top though\"<br>\r\n\"I think it looks amazing\" chimed in Sophie \"Even better than this shirt we got you, though I suppose you've seen it already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of Sophie holding up the \"World's Best Friend\" shirt lifted Eve's spirits somewhat.<br>\r\n\"Try it on\" said Sophie \"I wanna see if it fits.\"<br>\r\nEve shrugged and pulled on the shirt over the top of her spandex. \"It fits perfectly\" she said \"Though I think I'll be wearing this costume most of the time from now on.\"<br>\r\n\"You can keep it for if you ever need a secret identity\" teased Sophie.<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" added Jessica \"Or just to remind you that we'll all always be here for each other - no matter what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve smiled, and took a moment to look into everyone's school bags, testing out her power as much as she could. While she didn't feel confident practicing to develop a new power when she was surrounded by people, it was still interesting enough. She also noted her mother had given her over a hundred dollars in lunch money, which caused her to chuckle softly to herself. She then took to reading one of the books in another kid's bag before the bus stopped at the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you all this afternoon!\" called the driver cheerily.<br>\r\n\"Best friend hug!\" said Jessica, and the three girls hugged each other once again before getting off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Eve crossed the school courtyard to get to her class, she passed some kids who had managed to get their basketball stuck on the school roof. Sensing the first opportunity to use her powers to help people, Eve levitated up and tossed the ball down to the younger students below. \"Thanks Eve!\" called a small boy, running back to play ball with his friends. Eve glided back down towards the ground, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued on to her class, she listened in to conversations happening around the school. Using her omnivision she even saw and heard the principal talk to the teachers about their \"special responsibilities\" or something now that a young supergirl was in their midst. This time, however, she was a little more careful not to become too focused on the meeting. Keeping tabs of both what was happening directly in front of her and in the staff room some distance away was the kind of mental juggling that Eve wasn't used to, but it was also the sort of thing she figured she should slowly figure out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she realized two 12-year-olds kids were going smoking around the back of the toilet block. Again wanting to make a good impression as a hero, she raced off to where they were, levitating on to the roof of the block, and then floating down on the other side where they were. The two girls back there ran away as fast as they could as soon as they saw her without saying a word, leaving their cigarette packets behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve sighed and went on, but then heard that two students were getting angry at each other in another class nearby. One of them, she realized, was holding a pair of scissors. Again racing off, she made it into the classroom pretty quickly, bursting dramatically through the door.<br>\r\n\"Eve?\" asked Jessica \"What are you doing in my class?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry Jessie\" replied Eve with a smile to her friend, before turning to the arguing students \"But you two should know better. Don't brandish scissors when you're having a big argument. Sort it out like grown-ups. Remember - scissors are basically like two knives, so be very careful with them!\"<br>\r\nBoth students lowered their heads in shame. \"Yes Eve\" they both said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve left the class happy with how much good she had done. It caused a buzz deep inside her, that made her feel a lot better about herself as well, and in a strange sort of way, made her feel more powerful. In fact, she realized, it was exactly what she needed after Percy's mean remarks that morning. Then, however, she remembered her mother's words, cautioning her about using or practicing her powers at school. She supposed that she should probably get to class then anyway, and hoped she hadn't come across as too much of a freak or jerk. The teachers could sort out things from now on, she guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve got to class just before the bell rang. A boy who sat across from her desk approached her. Eve recognized him as Jack, a sort of nerdy kid who was usually very shy and didn't talk much.<br>\r\n\"Hey, umm, Eve\" he gulped, shaking heavily \"I think you're really pretty - I mean, err - can I get an interview with you for the school paper after school by any chance? I know you're really beautiful - I mean busy, sorry - but umm, it would really help me and maybe get your name out there a bit so... please?\"<br>\r\nEve smiled. \"Thanks, but I've got some training to do after school.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh - uhmmm - ok, that's fine\" replied Jack a little sadly \"I'll see you around then... maybe another time, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, another time would be great\" said Eve as she continued to her desk, causing Jack to almost faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well students\" said the teacher, Mr Andrews \"It's your last week in this class. Next year will be your final year of middle school, so I hope you're ready! We've got a lot of fun learning still to go, so don't get sidetracked!\"<br>\r\nJust then Mr Andrews looked around the room and noticed that only Eve was looking at him. Everyone else was looking at Eve.<br>\r\n\"OK, I know that Eve's a good looking young lady\" he said \"And I know that she has super powers now too, but it doesn't matter. I'm still the teacher, and everyone still has to pay attention to me. Anyone caught spending all lesson just drooling over Eve will be put on detention. Clear?\"<br>\r\nThis talk got the class back to attention. \"Yes mister Andrews\" they all said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright team, today we're starting off with some light maths\" said Mr Andrews, to the general disappointment of his students \"Specifically, long division. So how about we refresh our brains on how to do it by working through exercises five point two, three and four in your books. You can come to me if you need any help, but this should take you through to the end of the hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve groaned too, not failing to notice everyone else stealing glances as her as she got out her exercise books. She didn't mind the attention, of course, but it looked like the class next door was having a much more fun lesson. Indeed, Eve soon came to the realization that she could learn from every class in the school at the same time with her powers, but remembering her mother again, she decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the problems in her exercise book, however, Eve was confused. The problems were easy. She wasn't usually good at maths but the answers just seemed to be right there in front of her. She didn't even need to consciously calculate, it was just automatic. Cautiously, she began writing down the answers in her workbook. She soon noticed Jack copying off her but she didn't mind. Indeed, everyone else in the class was having real trouble with some of the questions. One girl at the back was secretly using a calculator, while a boy was whispering to his friend about how much of a nerd Eve was. Still, Eve didn't mind at this point, knowing better than to get angry or frustrated after what happened to her table the previous night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As the president is now incapacitated, it is with a heavy heart that I assume the office of the president for the time being. The country faces broad challenges and many threats at this time, particularly from crime. Therefore in the coming weeks I shall make maintaining law and order my top priority, until a new election is held - for which, I might add, I am announcing my candidacy right now. These law and order measures may be extreme, but remember - we cannot trust anyone at this time, even those within our own government.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strong words there from vice president Mitt Ghenease, a former long-serving police minister who was selected by the president to be the new vice president shortly before the president's assassination, in what some are calling an extremely happy coincidence, given Mitt's known tough stance on organized crime. The announcement will be welcomed by mayors around the country, as crime statistics are at their highest since records began...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Andrews? May I be excused? I need to go to the bathroom\" said Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Andrews looked up from his desk, where by now over half the class had lined up to get help with various problems. \"How much have you finished?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"I've done every problem in the book, marked them myself, and then used my super-vision to do every problem in next year's workbook too\" she replied \"It's all pretty easy so far. I'm just marking the rest of my problems from new year, but I'm yet to get any wrong.\"<br>\r\nMr Andrews adjusted his glasses. \"You're not just using your powers to look at the answers pages, are you?\"<br>\r\n\"No sir. Really.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright then, Eve. Make it quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to herself at her newfound super intellect, Eve left the class to go to the bathroom. There, she immediately saw a boy with a camera trying to hide from her.<br>\r\n\"Seriously Damon?\" asked Eve, her hands on her hips \"Go back to your class.\"<br>\r\nDamon rushed off, extremely embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve went into one of the stalls, just as she realized how inconvenient it is to go to the toilet wearing a spandex costume. She eventually took it mostly off, which left her feeling slightly exposed and less like a super hero. When she was done, she redressed and washed her hands, noticing with approval that her reflection seemed ever so slightly cuter than it did even before school that morning, although she had somewhat guessed that from the reactions of her classmates. It was as though she was inching towards physical perfection extremely slowly, but steadily. She also felt like she actually was slightly taller than she had been the day before, but not by much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust in that moment, Eve realized that the corner store down the street was being robbed. She could clearly hear the shouts of the robbers and see the gun being pointed. Realizing she had to make a quick decision, she felt an urgent need to help out and use her powers, but she also clearly remembered the words of warning from her mother.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eve didn't really know why, but before she knew it she was already running out of the school, going after the robbers in the corner store, covering the distance quickly as she had before soccer practice the day before, and again, surprising herself at how she didn't seem to get tired. As she went, she practiced switching rapidly between looking ahead of her, and watching what was going on. She found it easier if she focused her listening and where she looked to the same place, but she also checked in one the police scanner, noticing that the cops apparently weren't aware of what was happening yet. The closest cop car she could see was many blocks away, and that officer was apparently on break, drinking coffee and eating a donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two robbers were holding the store owner at gunpoint and emptying his till, Eve quickly went around the back of the store, levitating slightly with each step so as to be as quiet as possible. She levitated up to the back window, opened it quietly, and snuck inside without being seen. Quickly she descended, keeping a soft landing to avoid making a noise, and hid behind several shelves of goods. The window, however, did make a noise as it closed again, shutting with a loud clang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately one of the robbers pointed his gun in the direction of the window.<br>\r\n\"Let it go\" said the other robber, snatching more and more cash out of the register \"It's probably just the wind.\"<br>\r\n\"Well hurry up\" replied the other one \"You've been fingering that money for a couple of minutes now - we've got to get a move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve took a moment to use her super vision to look beyond the dark balaclavas and clothes of the robbers and see they were both middle aged men. She took her time to get a good description in case she needed it, then crept around to hide near the entranceway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I've got the loot. Let's get out of here.\"<br>\r\nWith that the two robbers made for the front door. Acting completely on gut instinct, Eve jumped out in their way, her costume seemingly flashing brightly as she did so. As both robbers saw the young, pretty but determined looking girl in front of them, they couldn't help but laugh a little, but they half-heartedly pointed their guns at her.<br>\r\n\"Who do you think you are? Some kind of superhero?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what kind of a costume is that, freak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Eve felt that the robber's words echoed the words of the bully Percy on the bus. A kind of annoyance flashed over her at how easily others were judging her, but she quickly remembered her mother's warning, and also above all, her friends. In a way it made her appreciate them more because she knew they'd remain friends no matter what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to know who I am?\" asked Eve \"I'm Eve, the town's newest superhero. Drop the guns and hand over the money, or I'll tell the cops.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm so scared\" laughed one of the robbers \"A little girl's going to call her mommy on me. Is that really the best you've got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve sighed and performed a quick kung fu move to disarm both robbers and take their guns, pointing them at them. The robbers were stunned, and Eve was a little surprised too. She didn't really know how she'd learnt that, but assumed that it had probably just come with her super intelligence. Either way, it was a useful trick. One of the two robbers immediately threw his hands up in the air, full of fear. The other one, who had the money and was also the one who'd insulted Eve just as Percy had, however, was unmoved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seriously want to shoot me? Come on, little girl\" he teased \"Shoot me. You're not just a freak, you're a little girl with no guts. Now let me past before I knock you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the robber's comment made Eve quite angry, but she ignored the feeling as much as she could. \"You'd better shut your mouth... right... now\" she warned, levitating up so she was eye level with the robber, and not showing the slightest hint of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was somewhat unexpected, as both robbers backed away slowly, mouths agape. \"Woah... you can fly?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, actually technically I can only levita... wait, I mean, yes. Yes. I can fly. And I can also do all sorts of other cool things.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you're a real superhero? I'm sorry, I thought you were just faking. Because if you were, you know, you know we'd have to teach you a lesson.\"<br>\r\nThis made Eve angry enough that she couldn't stop herself from cocking the gun. \"Don't you dare talk about hurting anyone again. Trust me, you do not want to see what I can do when I get annoyed\" she said, thinking of the solid table she had particalized the night before.<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok, take it easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the overwhelming rush returned to her. Eve felt like this was what she was meant to do - what she was born to do. And she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the background, the store owner had already taken to calling the police. Using her vision powers, Eve could tell that two cop cars were on their way and would arrive very shortly. Smiling to herself, Eve surrendered both guns to the store owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure these two low-lives don't run away\" she said lightly \"I have to go and get back to school\"<br>\r\n\"How can I ever repay you?\" asked the store owner.<br>\r\n\"Oh, no charge\" she smiled \"Maybe one day you can get me a discount on some food here or something though - I'm starved.\"<br>\r\n\"I won't forget it\" said the store owner, as he and Eve mutually waved goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve smiled to herself as she ran back to the class. After all those heroics, she felt even more powerful than before. Like something big was building up inside her. Still, she also felt a kind of shame at having skipped a bit of class, and not listened to her mother. She knew that she could have been killed quite easily, and in retrospect, she couldn't believe what she had just done. In fact she wasn't sure where the sudden courage had come from, since usually Eve could be quite squeamish. She also remotely kept an eye on the situation in the corner store, but it seemed her judgment had been right, and the store owner was handling things quite well with the robbers disarmed and the police on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I took so long\" she said as she came back to the room, noting that she had been gone for over fourty-five minutes.<br>\r\n\"I hope you used the time constructively\" said Mr Andrews, as Eve noticed the line to his desk was no shorter. Eve settled back down to her desk with a smile, and was about to start where she had left off, before she quickly raised her hand, interrupting Mr Andrews again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mr Andrews, can I do some problems from that textbook you have in the back room? They look a bit harder so... I just figured I want to exercise my brain a bit more.\" said Eve, eager to practice her super intelligence power.<br>\r\n\"Eve, those are university level problems\" replied Mr Andrews.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can tell\" said Eve, happily \"Still, they all look easy enough to me.\"<br>\r\nMr Andrews shrugged. \"Fine. Do you want me to get it for you.\"<br>\r\nEve activated her super vision. \"Actually, sir, I can read it well enough from here...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lunch came quickly enough, and Eve soon found herself holding up the whole school cafeteria with her giant order. In fact she didn't even spend all the money her mother had given her to be polite to the other students, but somehow she knew she would still be hungry when she'd eaten it all. Her mother was really right about superpower development giving you a super appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waited, a boy called Felix walked up to her. Felix was known around the school for being quite popular and having a lot of friends, and a trail of his friends was following him around even now.<br>\r\n\"Hey Eve\" he said \"I just wanted to say, I really admire you, and your costume is awesome and all that, so ummm... do you want to hang out together at some point? Maybe after school?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" replied Eve \"But first I have to train. If I ever don't train, then I'm doing an interview with Jack. And I also need to hang out with my best friends, Jessica and Sophie.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh\" said Felix, quite dejected \"Well, ummm... sorry for the interruption. I'll see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last her order was finished, and Eve carried a small mountain of food to an outside picnic table where her best friends were waiting for her, who both looked at her awkwardly.<br>\r\n\"Won't that make you... fat?\" asked Sophie.<br>\r\n\"I thought that at first too\" replied Eve \"But apparently it doesn't work that way for superheros.\"<br>\r\nSophie shrugged and finished eating her designer club sandwich.<br>\r\n\"So how are you feeling?\" asked Jessica \"Any new powers? I hope that Percy didn't get you down too much on the bus this morning.\"<br>\r\nEve laughed, having just quickly gulped down a large mouthful of food. \"I thought you were the one telling me not to worry! But I'm doing great, honestly. In fact I've been feeling really good inside ever since I saved the corner store down the road from two armed robbers this morning.\"<br>\r\n\"You did that?\" asked Sophie, impressed \"I would have been too scared.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's strange\" replied Eve \"This sudden rush of courage just came over me - I just felt like I needed to help, so I did. Like my instinct was just telling me what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is this seat free?\" asked Peter, a boy from Jessica's class.<br>\r\n\"Do you actually want to sit with us, or are you just trying to score a date with me?\" asked Eve.<br>\r\n\"Just a date, to be honest...\"<br>\r\n\"Well then, maybe some other time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've still been asked out by more boys today\" bragged Sophie.<br>\r\n\"It's not a competition\" reminded Jessica \"So you don't have any new powers now, Eve?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm smarter than I used to be\" said Eve \"Like, I suddenly found all the problems in my maths book extremely easy. I even found university level maths extremely easy. It all just kind of intuitively makes sense to me now.\"<br>\r\n\"Great!\" said Jessica \"You should tutor me! I'm useless at maths.\"<br>\r\n\"Usually I am too\" giggled Eve, taking another huge mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passed while Eve finished the rest of her gigantic meal, and the three girls finished their chat, talking about school, and then moving on to celebrity crushes. A few times Eve was tempted to fight bad things that she sensed were happening around the school and the city, but for now she felt she'd had her fix - not to mention that she didn't want to just abandon her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Eve, have your arms always been that huge?\" observed Jessica.<br>\r\nEve looked at her arms, which were suddenly quite muscular. Indeed, when she levitated up, she and everyone else saw that her whole body had somehow become ripped with muscle - toned and athletic all over, and better than any young gymnast her age, while maintaining her soft and cute look. Eve started moving around, examining herself all over. In addition, she felt like she'd grown slightly taller again, and though she was still far from the tallest in the class, it was still noticeable given that only 24 hours ago, Eve didn't know about any powers at all.<br>\r\n\"Woah - you are huge\" wooed Jessica.<br>\r\n\"What kind of steroids were in all that food?\" asked Sophie \"It's like half of it just transformed straight into muscle.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and ummm - I have gym class next, so...\" began Eve, levitating back down.<br>\r\n\"Well then, you need to tell us all about it!\" said Sophie cheerfully.<br>\r\n\"Best friend hug!\" declared Jessica, and the three friends did their ritual before going on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eve went towards the school gym building, Emma, a girl from her class who was a junior cheerleader, went up to her. \"Hey, Eve!\" she said \"Do you need togs? We're doing swimming today. I have an extra set in case you didn't bring yours.\"<br>\r\nEve sighed. \"You trying to go out with me now?\"<br>\r\n\"No no. Nothing like that\" laughed Emma \"I just want to help you out. Also, I want you to be the captain of our cheerleading squad.\"<br>\r\n\"Captain?\" asked Eve.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I mean, you're the center of attention everywhere you go. If you cheer, the other team will get distracted, your team will get inspired - you're just a natural at it, Eve. And you can probably do moves that none of us can. And I hear you're super smart now, so you'll know how to teach us too.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it\" replied Eve, unsure of whether she would have the time to do it.<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" smiled Emma, holding up a small bikini \"You're the best. So, umm, do you need this? You can keep them if you like - just a present in advance, in case you ever need to save me or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve smiled, and soon enough she was in the girl's changing rooms, getting into Emma's spare and revealing swimwear, showing off her beautiful and muscular body to the variously jealous and impressed girls around the changing room. Striking one or two poses for her captivated audience, she went outside to wait with her class. Immediately, all eyes were on her. The boys seemed particularly affected, eyeing up every square centimeter of skin. Only Jack managed to control himself, looking away and blushing, though Eve could see that he was clearly extremely attracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright class!\" said the gym teacher, Mr White \"Today we're focusing on butterfly swimming, one of the most physically demanding styles. I want everyone to give it their all, alright? Swim as fast as you can, otherwise we'll be here all day. Everyone does one lap, and I'll tell you what you need to work on for the rest of the lesson. Remember, we're not judging anyone here. You all got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole class nodded, and Mr White checked his clipboard. \"Eve, you're up first\" he announced.<br>\r\nEve was quite nervous. She didn't really know why, but somehow she was as she stepped up to the diving board of the pool. In the background, somebody wolf whistled, to the annoyance of Mr White. \"Just give it your best shot, Eve\" he said \"Fast as possible, butterfly style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve drew a quick breath, and then launched herself a little harder than usual - though not nearly as hard as she was capable of - off the diving board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout using her levitation powers at all, Eve suddenly found herself soaring up through the sky. Her kick off the board not only shattered the board, but it caused a large sonic boom that knocked everybody off their feet and nearly emptied the pool. As Eve went up through the atmosphere, she realized with horror that her swimwear had disintegrated, leaving her naked. She managed to cover up just in time with her hands as she went past the international space station. Seconds later, she did a backflip around the moon and was plummeting back towards earth. Very briefly the earth's atmosphere burnt around her, causing her to appear like a very fast comet for a split second, although for some reason Eve wasn't hurt at all. Then finally, before Eve had much of a chance to process what was really happening, she landed in exactly the same location she took off from, went straight through the ground and continued down, leaving behind a small hole that was immediately filled in by the surrounding dirt, causing a small earthquake on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve kept \"falling\" as the rocks around her became heavier, harder and hotter. Eventually all the rock was molten and she was still falling, until the pressure became to great and she fell right into the solid core at the center of the earth. Finally she came to a stop at a point her super intelligence told her was the center of the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the extreme heat and pressure, Eve found the weight of the entire planet, with everything on it, to be light as a feather. She was literally now holding up the entire earth, and she wasn't even straining. Even her hair seemed easily strong enough to withstand the intense forces of the whole world. She stayed there for a moment while the reality of it dawned on her. She was strong. Impossibly strong. The laws of physics literally made what she was currently doing impossible. Nobody was going to believe this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of gentle kicking she eventually made her way back to the surface, causing a small aftershock to the earthquake she had created. Looking around (still covering herself up) she was relieved to see that the damage she had caused had been minor, but she had left the entire class in a state of considerable shock at what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was not a butterfly stroke\" said Mr White sternly, going to get a hose to re-fill the pool \"And put some clothes on young lady, or else you'll be in big trouble.\"<br>\r\nThe rest of the class was too awe-struck by Eve's incredible physique to even giggle at that.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\" said Eve, before running away at impossible super speeds with her newly enhanced legs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eve went back to the changing room to find her superhero costume was missing as well. With a quick scan around of her super vision, she realized Percy, the school's biggest bully, had her costume in the back of his bag and was laughing about it to his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve quickly changed into Emma's usual clothes, hoping that Emma wouldn't mind as she was still swimming. She didn't want to confront Percy naked after all. As she did so, she was reminded once again of how weird she felt wearing clothes other than her costume. Somehow wearing that costume just felt right to her. In a flash, she was standing right in front of Percy, incensed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well\" said Percy \"If it isn't the school's resident freak. I was wondering when you would show up, dork.\"<br>\r\n\"Percy\" said Eve sternly, her rage building \"Give it back.\"<br>\r\n\"No\" replied Percy \"We don't negotiate with losers like you. I told you - just go back to your home planet. Or did they not want a freak like you either? Isn't that why you were sent here? What are you gonna do to me, levitate slightly? Bring it on!\"<br>\r\nAt that, Eve lost it, and held Percy in a choke hold. Percy tried to fight out of it, but against Eve's infinitely strong arms there was literally nothing he could do. Eve started to levitate up, holding Percy by his throat some meters above the ground.<br>\r\n\"Argh! Is this it?\" sniggered Percy, still fighting \"Some kind of little girl freak who wants to kill me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw the rude yet helpless Percy, however, she couldn't bring herself to actually do something to him. Her rage rapidly coming back under control, she loosened her grip and let him down, defeated.<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought\" boasted Percy \"You're too much of a 'hero'! You'd never hurt a poor guy like me. And that's why you're not getting your costume back.\"<br>\r\n\"No\" responded Eve \"I won't hurt you.\"<br>\r\n\"See?\" said Percy to his friends \"What did I tell you?\"<br>\r\n\"But I'm still getting my suit back\" said Eve, using her super strength to wrench Percy's backpack right off his back.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Give me back my bag, that's mine\" said Percy, helplessly trying to punch Eve's super strong body but only injuring his own fists.<br>\r\n\"Your bag?\" asked Eve, pulling out her costume from inside the bag, \"That's funny, because it has my stuff in it.\"<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean it! I'm sorry!\" he said \"Give me back my bag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve shrugged and tossed the bag back to him, the force of her powerful throw sending him flying to the ground.<br>\r\n\"Next time\" said Eve, trying to control her own frustration at the bully \"Next time I might not be so nice to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she ran back to the changing rooms, putting back Emma's clothes and changing back into her own costume just as gym class ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen school was over, Eve went back to the bus. Of course she could have run home at super speeds, but she wanted to see her friends again. As she boarded she saw Percy and some girl she didn't know nursing a large bruise on Percy's neck. She felt really bad about what she'd done to him, but moved on quickly after Percy shot her a mean, hostile glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Eve!\" said Jessica excitedly \"I heard you beat up Percy! You go girl! About time somebody showed Percy what's up!\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" said Eve a little sadly \"I feel pretty bad about it. Percy was defenseless.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well in my opinion, you do the crime, you probably want to get beat up by Eve\" mentioned Sophie \"Honestly, you can't expect us to be like the Percy fan club right now.\"<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter\" added Jessica quickly \"We're friends no matter what. I hope you don't get in trouble over it.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I don't want to do that again\" said Eve quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you held up the entire Earth while in the core\" said Sophie, quickly changing the subject.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it turns out I have unlimited strength now\" she said, flexing her muscles \"It made gym class a bit awkward.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll bet\" said Jessica, squeezing Eve's arm \"I can't believe I was the first to notice these muscles. It's so great being friends with a superhero.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're already better than any comic hero I know\" said Sophie.<br>\r\n\"Better than superman?\" asked Eve.<br>\r\n\"Way better\" smiled Sophie \"Especially because you're my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the bus stopped near Eve's house. \"Best friend hug!\" said Jessica as she always did, and the three girls hugged each other, giggling. As she always did, Eve found the spare key to her house and went inside. She sat down on the couch and decided to keep doing the training she'd been doing on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again she concentrated on looking at herself from the vantage point of across the room. It took a moment to get in the frame of mind of working on her visual powers again, since all afternoon she'd been preoccupied with her new physical powers. Once she did, however, she found it a little easier to get back to the blurry image she achieved that morning. It took a lot of effort, but eventually, she found she was, in fact, looking at herself sitting on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving achieved that, she then tried combining that with seeing through walls, as her mother had taught her the day before to practice combining her powers. This again took a lot of mental effort. Eve strained and she strained, but eventually she managed it just in time to see her mother pull into the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve? You home?\" called out her mother.<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" said Eve, rushing over \"You won't believe what kind of powers I got today!\"<br>\r\n\"Won't I?\" replied her mother, hands on her hips \"Try me.\"<br>\r\n\"Super strength!\" said Eve, flexing her huge arm muscles \"And I'm super smart now too. Oh, and I JUST taught myself how to use my super-vision from any vantage point. I can literally see anything in the universe that I like now! It's great!\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing unbelievable there\" said her mother, kissing Eve's forehead gently \"Not to mention that you look great too, sweetheart. I'll bet you get the attention of all the boys with a body like that.\"<br>\r\nEve blushed. \"Well, I've been asked on a few dates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve's mother smiled as she went off to the kitchen. \"Good to hear you're doing some training on your own, though I'd wish you didn't do so much at school\" she said \"Those two robbers at the corner store definitely could have killed you.\"<br>\r\n\"I know\" replied Eve sadly \"Wait a moment - how did you hear about that?\"<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, it was all over the news\" laughed her mother \"They even interviewed some bully who said you beat him up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve looked up quizzically. Experimentally, she tried tuning her eyes like she did with her ears when she wanted to listen to the radio. Sure enough, she had little trouble picking up TV stations too. There was her face in her costume, all around screens across the world, captured on security camera footage from the dairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expect the paparazzi will be here soon\" smiled her mother \"Just don't say anything stupid while you're with the media. You don't want to get a bad reputation if you're a superhero. Rather, you should always be somebody the people look up to.\"<br>\r\n\"So you're not mad at me?\" asked Eve.<br>\r\nEve's mother smiled. \"Eve, I could never get mad at you. You're my daughter, and I love you forever. Always remember that. Now go to your room and practice your levitation. You might want to work on going up and down a little bit faster. Tonight, we'll see if you can actually go in all directions - that is, really fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, agent, we may have a complication\" said the secretary \"It seems I was right. A superhero has emerged in the form of a young girl.\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT!? How?\" asked the agent \"It's not possible - you must be mistaken.\"<br>\r\n\"You know how meticulous I am\" replied the secretary coldly \"But I know exactly how to deal with her.\"<br>\r\n\"You do? Ummm...\"<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry agent. Continue with the plan as normal. I will keep everything under control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, mom, that meal was delicious\" said Eve.<br>\r\n\"I hoped you'd like it\" said her mother shyly \"It's hard to disguise the taste of rat poison.\"<br>\r\nEve almost vomited. \"You put WHAT in my food?\"<br>\r\nHer mother pulled a packet of rat poison out of the cupboard. \"I'm trying to train your stomach, sweetie. You should be getting immunity to all poisons, toxins, diseases and such, so this is just a kind of way of waking up your power a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve pouted. \"I wish you'd warn a little before you do something like that.\"<br>\r\nHer mother smiled back. \"Sure thing. Next time, I will. Now, you want to go outside and practice some flying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Eve stood outside and levitated up in the air in the evening twilight. Her practice earlier had gone well, and she could now move up and down quite quickly.<br>\r\n\"Now, I want you to concentrate really hard, and will yourself forwards\" said Eve's mother.<br>\r\nAs she was quite used to doing by now, Eve closed her eyes and concentrated hard. To her surprise, she actually got the hang of it within a few minutes or so. She began moving forwards, albeit extremely slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good!\" called out her mother \"Now try flying a little faster!\"<br>\r\nEve concentrated more and more, but this seemed to be the rub. She could fly slowly no problem, but going faster was just frustratingly hard.<br>\r\n\"Come on, you can do it!\" cheered her mother \"I believe in you, sweetie! Try to keep that superman pose too, it looks great!\"<br>\r\nEve pushed herself forward as much as her mind could muster. Eventually she managed to get up to a ground running speed, though in the air it didn't seem that fast. She also got used to holding her body in a few different positions, doing a couple of figure eights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Eve\" called her mother \"You've done really well. That was impressive for your first flight. Now it's time for bed.\"<br>\r\n\"Aww, but I'm not even tired!\" replied Eve, flying back towards the door.<br>\r\n\"I said it's time for bed\" said her mother sternly, leading her back inside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eve walked back to her bedroom. She was about to change into her pajamas when a thought occurred to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom?\" she called \"Can I wear my costume to bed? Please?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course you can, sweetie\" called her mother back \"I'm glad that you like it so much! That suit is resistant to pretty much everything, so it should be safe.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Eve \"So I can even swim in it?\"<br>\r\nHer mother chucked. \"Yeah. The suit even dries your skin afterwards automatically.\"<br>\r\n\"You have no idea how useful that would have been to know earlier today, mom\" replied Eve, to which her mother only laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her mother's traditions, Eve then went to the bathroom to brush her perfect white teeth. She amused herself by using her super vision to watch as the toothpaste killed off individual germs on her teeth, but soon she grew tired of that and headed to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Eve\" smiled her mother as she came into Eve's room and tucked the young super-heroine into the covers \"I hope your first full day with powers was lots of fun.\"<br>\r\n\"You bet\" said Eve in a pretend-tired voice.<br>\r\n\"OK. You have a good rest\" said her mother, turning out the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Eve's eyes adjusted immediately to the darkness. She watched as her mother went away from the room and started to search for a new table in a home-buying catalog. Satisfied that her mother would not come and check up on her, Eve scanned around the community, wondering what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she noticed was a domestic dispute down the road. A husband and wife were arguing with each other because the wife had cheated on her husband. Once again, Eve felt the same overwhelming compulsion to use her powers to calm things down. She snuck out of bed, slowly and quietly, with the hope that her mother wasn't listening to the creak that her bed made whenever she moved in it. With a quick check using her powers to see that her mother hadn't noticed anything, she quietly opened her window and jumped outside, enjoying for a moment the cool evening breeze. Then, with a minimum of effort, she ran at super speeds to the home with the dispute and pressed calmly on the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the bloody hell are you?\" asked a very angry looking man, opening the door.<br>\r\n\"Don't you watch the news?\" asked Eve \"I'm Eve, the newest super hero in town. You two need to stop arguing and calm down right now. You're supposed to be adults, so just settle this quietly, before somebody gets hurt.\"<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious!\" yelled the man \"Susan! Did you call the bloody cops and tell 'em to send some kid around 'ere?\"<br>\r\n\"You know I wouldn't do things behind your back Peter!\" yelled a woman's voice back.<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" yelled Eve, stamping her foot to the ground and causing the Earth to rumble. Peter mumbled something about more bloody earthquakes, but other than that it shut the two of them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two need to seriously get a grip\" said Eve, flying inside and sitting down in their living room \"And yes Peter, the baby inside Susan is yours, I can see his DNA. But Susan, you need to calm down too. You both have good reason to be angry, but you need to compromise and work this out before you start hurting each other. You both understand?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes Eve\" they both muttered, walking into the living room and sitting down.<br>\r\n\"And don't let me hear you still arguing after I fly away either\" said Eve, as she left them to negotiate there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were a little stunned at the young girl but said nothing as she flew away. Just before she closed the door, though, Peter stopped her. \"Wait\" he said \"Thank you. Thanks for stopping by.\"<br>\r\n\"Anytime\" said Eve, as she flew away, feeling amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve flew around above the neighborhood. For a while she practiced going faster, but she still couldn't top the running speed she'd reached earlier, despite much effort. Then something caught her eye. It was Jack, the young nerdy reporter from school. He was looking at an old picture of Eve in the school magazine from last year with a longing expression. Then, using a small black marker, he drew over the top of Eve's old clothes her new superhero outfit. Underneath that he wrote the caption \"Eve, Protector of the Universe\", cut it out, and glued it carefully to his wall, staring at it and sighing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, it's time for bed\" called Jack's dad.<br>\r\n\"But dad, I'm not tired\" protested Jack.<br>\r\n\"Jack, go to bed, now\" replied his dad sternly \"No more excuses. Go to the toilet, have a shower, brush your teeth, get changed, sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve flew down to a nearby park, hiding shyly in a tree and watching as Jack finished his evening routine. Somehow she felt that after all of the invitations to date she'd received that day, his had been the most heartfelt. It was almost like she felt sorry for him, but then, she also was starting to actually like him for who he was, in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted as she realized Peter and Susan were arguing again. Running with her powerful legs back to their place in a couple of bounds, she tapped lightly on their window to remind them that she was always listening in. Correctly guessing that it was her outside, the couple calmed down their discussion again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went back to Jack's house to see that Jack's dad had just turned the lights off. Jack was lying there with a tear in his eye, quietly saying some prayers that even if Eve was too good for him, that God would still watch over Eve and protect her. Eve could hold herself back no longer, flying up to outside his window. She hesitated before knocking a little, feeling a little embarrassed that she was even secretly listening in, but eventually found the courage to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sat up in his bed, hearing the knock outside his window. A little confused, he drew back the curtains, only to nearly fall back with shock and delight when he saw Eve flying out there. With a little hesitation while he composed himself, he opened the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh - hi, umm, Eve\" he whispered, shaking, as Eve giggled outside \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm just flying around\" said Eve \"I can do that now - I got a new power.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh - uh - cool, yes\" said Jack, getting more nervous by the second.<br>\r\n\"I heard your prayer as I passed by\" said Eve \"So I thought, since you wanted to interview me, why not let you do that right now?\"<br>\r\nJack was breathing heavily. \"Ummm... I don't really...\" he began.<br>\r\n\"It's ok to be nervous\" interjected Eve \"I need to practice talking to the media anyway.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's not that\" gulped Jack \"It's just, my dad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack!\" yelled his dad from the other room \"Are you talking on your phone after your bedtime?\"<br>\r\n\"No dad!\" called Jack back.<br>\r\n\"You better not be!\" yelled Jack's dad.<br>\r\nEve giggled. \"Oh, I see\" she whispered, opening the window a little further to allow her to fly inside \"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery gently, still flying, she lifted the covers off of Jack's bed, leaving him lying there in his boxers, too amazed to be able to move. Flying to the cupboard Eve tossed him some clothes, and getting the hint, he rapidly tossed them on. Then, she picked him up very gently, and carefully flew out of the window with him, up into the sky, before coming down beside a romantic moonlit creek at the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was a little flustered, his greatest fantasy having just come true. Eve giggled again.<br>\r\n\"So\" said Eve, lying down on the grass and looking up at the stars \"The interview...\"<br>\r\n\"Right\" said Jack, lying down beside her and trying hard not to just stare at her \"Well, ummm... sorry I'm a bit nervous... is it true that you're... from another planet?\"<br>\r\n\"My father is\" replied Eve \"My mother's from here though.\"<br>\r\n\"So you don't really know your father?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, until yesterday I thought he was dead. Turns out he's just in another world.\"<br>\r\nJack sighed. \"My mother died giving birth to me. I pray every night that she's in another world now, too.\"<br>\r\n\"That's really sweet.\"<br>\r\nThis made Jack blush deeply. \"Soo... what's the story behind you punching Percy in the throat?\"<br>\r\nNow it was Eve's turn to be embarrassed. \"I didn't punch him really, I held him in a choke hold. I didn't mean it though. It was by accident. He just made me angry because he stole my costume.\"<br>\r\n\"He's such a jerk. The whole school respects you now for that, you know? I mean, I liked you a lot before, but...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can tell. I got that impression. Even my best friends were glad about it.\"<br>\r\n\"Jessica and Sophie are your best friends, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we met in girl scouts and... hey, I think I need to take you back now? Your dad is walking towards your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA note of alarm crossed Jack's face. \"I'm sorry!\" he said quickly as Eve carefully picked him up and flew off \"I won't tell him you came, I promise!\"<br>\r\n\"It's alright, he won't notice - we can finish the interview tomorrow\" said Eve, quickly flying back into the window and tossing him on his bed, not even realizing that in her urgency she'd beaten her air speed record significantly.<br>\r\nJack rapidly stripped back into his boxers while Eve rapidly tucked in the covers of his bed exactly as she had found them.<br>\r\n\"Good night\" said Eve to Jack, kissing him gently on his cheek as she flew out.<br>\r\n\"Good night\" whispered Jack, quickly closing the window and the curtains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant Jack lay back down, Eve saw Jack's father opened Jack's door and look around the room. Jack crossed his fingers and clenched his eyes shut, hoping that his father wouldn't notice anything. He didn't, and soon left the room. Eve watched as Jack put his hand to his cheek where she had kissed him before going to sleep, completely overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve flew back to her room, noticing a small note had been stuck on her window frame. She looked around for where the note might have come from, but saw nobody acting suspicious in the surrounding neighborhood. The note said simply:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Meet me at 2am tomorrow, under the Interstate Bridge<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The Secretary</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eve woke up the following morning feeling a little strange. Not only was she again sleeping while levitated, but for the first time since she started getting her powers, she actually felt uncomfortable. It was an unusual sort of itch that she had across the front of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh\" she whispered, recalling some health class that she had once \"I'm growing breasts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve flipped around in the air, trying to get a good look at herself, but with no luck. Eventually she used her powers to try to look at herself, but it was no use. She tried focusing and re-focusing, but no matter what she did, she could no longer see herself. She even tried checking the heat of the air particles around her, noticing for a first time how cool it was that she could actually see heat. She hadn't realized that was a superpower before, but now that she thought about it - regardless, it was no use. It was like she was literally no longer there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Mom!\" cried Eve, flying downstairs in a panic \"Mom, can you see me?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not, sweetie\" replied her mother \"You're invisible. You just gained a new power.\"<br>\r\n\"I did? I mean, wow! Great! Check it out, mom, I'm invisible! Look at me!\"<br>\r\n\"I can't. That's the point of being invisible\"<br>\r\n\"So why can't you see my suit then?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess that's probably part of your power. Things you're wearing probably become invisible along with you.\"<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it\" said Eve while celebrating by flying around in little loops \"I can't wait to show the others at school!\"<br>\r\n\"They won't be able to see you either\" said her mother, not really sure where Eve was \"Now become visible again and eat your breakfast.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure\" said Eve excitedly \"How do I do that?\"<br>\r\n\"Figure it out!\" exclaimed her mother \"The same way you figured out how to control all your other powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve sat down invisibly and concentrated for a moment. It was an unfamiliar sort of thought, trying to change her own visibility. With a little mental strain, however, she slowly faded into view. As a test, she tried making herself invisible again. It turned out that her visibility was easier to control than most of her other powers had been, but it still took some getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally settling into a visible state, Eve went back upstairs and had a shower. As she took her suit off, she noticed that she'd been right - her breasts had grown slightly, for the first time, overnight. It had actually been quite a bit of growth for one night but to Eve they still looked extremely small. Still, since she was only 11, it wasn't as though she minded much. As she cleaned herself she noticed how the skin there felt at once sensitive, but also still as impossibly strong as the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the shower, she took a moment to admire her muscular, beautiful body one more time. She felt like she was even better looking now - probably beyond super-model level anyway, and quite possibly beyond what a normal human was capable of achieving, especially at her age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve put her skin-tight spandex costume back on and strolled to the makeshift table of the dining area, just as her mother finished cooking her breakfast. \"Any more rat poison in this, mom?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"No\" replied her mother, putting away a drum of green, bubbling liquid \"Just a bit of toxic waste. Don't worry, not enough to ruin the flavor of all that french toast I made you. Hey, your breasts look a bit bigger.\"<br>\r\n\"I know mom\" said Eve, suddenly feeling a little embarrassed about it. They were still feeling a bit itchy as well.<br>\r\n\"Just so long as you don't go flying out at night for dates\" laughed her mother.<br>\r\n\"Right\" Eve said in between chews of her massive breakfast.<br>\r\n\"So - I got a call from the school principal this morning.\"<br>\r\nEve's heart sank. She hoped that she wouldn't be expelled.<br>\r\n\"First of all, he wants to congratulate you for all the times that you saved the day yesterday. Especially when you saved his day by beating up some kid called Percy. Apparently he says Percy was a total jerk who needed to be taught a lesson.\"<br>\r\nEve almost spat out her food. \"For the last time, I didn't hit him! I didn't even mean to do anything to him, he just stole my suit!\"<br>\r\nHer mother laughed. \"The real reason he called me though, was to remove you from the class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked Eve, shocked \"They're expelling me?\"<br>\r\n\"No. They say you're a model student, but you're too good for their lessons. By law you have to attend school, but if you're over-achieving, there's no law on what you can study there.\"<br>\r\n\"So - what does this mean for me?\"<br>\r\n\"They'll put you in a spare room, by yourself, so you can get a college degree. We've enrolled you in a bunch of papers already - things pertinent to your superhero life, like law and ethics.\"<br>\r\n\"So - I won't get to sit with my classmates?\"<br>\r\n\"You'll still see them on the bus and at breaks. But you won't sit with them in class, no. Apparently the school board thinks you might be a distraction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve sighed, accepting it. She could certainly understand why other parents might have felt that way, but she knew that she would miss her classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And keep your back straight\" added her mother \"I know you want to hide your developing breasts a bit, but good back posture is much more important.\"<br>\r\nEve huffed, turning invisible as she did so, which made her mother laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later Eve was flying to the school bus stop. Seeing the bus was still some distance away, she turned invisible and practiced flying at higher speeds. It was still difficult, but slowly she was starting to get the hang of speeding up and slowing down. Shortly before the bus arrived she flew down and made herself visible at the bus stop again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, freak\" said Percy, now wearing a neck brace, as she boarded \"I didn't think you'd have the guts to show your pretty face around here again.\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up Percy\" commanded Eve, trying to gently push past him, but Percy didn't take the hint and kept stopping her from going to see her friends nearer to the back of the bus.<br>\r\n\"No, you shut up\" countered Percy \"You're a loser, not wanted on your home planet, or here. You don't belong anywhere. And you have the audacity to beat up a kid like me? You should have gone away a long time ago.\"<br>\r\nOnce again all eyes were on Eve. \"Fine\" she said \"I'll go away.\" And with that, she turned invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was stunned. It wasn't quite what he'd expected. \"Is she gone?\" asked some kid in the back.<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" said Eve, turning visible again \"And now I'm back. Now get back into your seat before I put you there, Percy.\"<br>\r\nPercy stared at her with venom in his eyes. Eve tried again, \"Look, I did what you said, I went away. Now that I'm back, it's your turn to move out of the way so I can sit with my friends.\"<br>\r\nWith a lot of visible reluctance, Percy sat back down. \"It's not over\" he whispered to her \"I'll get you back for all this! One day, I swear I'll get you back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve shrugged and re-joined Sophie and Jessica in the spot where the three friends usually sat.<br>\r\n\"Hey Eve\" said Sophie \"Cool power. You just turned invisible, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" said Eve \"And I can fly properly now too. And I've eaten about a ton of toxic waste and rat poison but don't feel sick in the slightest.\"<br>\r\n\"Not bad\" said Sophie, impressed \"And your outfit shows off your cute breasts too\".<br>\r\nEve made a little \"eep\" noise and turned half-invisible, causing her two friends to laugh. \"You look great\" laughed Jessica.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, mine started growing two years ago, still not as good as yours though\" said Sophie, as Eve turned visible again \"Mine are just less visible because I don't strut around in skin-tight spandex. You've got nothing to get self-conscious about - you're still the hottest thing in the school by a long shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway, did I tell you girls about my date last night?\" asked Jessica.<br>\r\n\"Ooo\" taunted Sophie playfully \"I still have the most dates though\"<br>\r\n\"Who'd you go out with?\" asked Eve.<br>\r\n\"Felix\" said Jessica \"He invited me to his place after school. We played video games mostly. It was heaps of fun!\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Eve \"Sounds great! He asked me out too.\"<br>\r\n\"Your loss\" taunted Jessica \"Though it's cool how you're training so hard to be a superhero.\"<br>\r\n\"Well - I did get a date of my own\" countered Eve playfully \"Sort of.\"<br>\r\n\"I still have more\" countered Sophie quickly.<br>\r\n\"I was just giving Jack an interview\" said Eve \"But he has this huge crush on me, so it was kinda romantic.\"<br>\r\nJessica laughed. \"Eve, as of yesterday, everyone in the school has a huge crush on you. I'll bet even Percy has a secret crush on you but can't bring himself to admit it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\" said a boy loudly on the seats behind Eve \"Did you guys hear that? Eve's dating Jack.\"<br>\r\n\"Ewww!\" chanted much of the bus \"Jack and Eve, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G! First comes the...\"<br>\r\nEve buried her head in her hands and turned invisible again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bus approached the school, rather than a large number of paparazzi as her mother had predicted, Eve saw a completely different kind of blockade - a military one. There were tanks and loads of armed officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" asked the driver, pulling over.<br>\r\n\"Sir, we wish to speak to the young superheroine, Eve. You and the other students may pass.\"<br>\r\n\"Eve!\" called the bus driver \"There's some soldiers here who want to talk to you!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eve quietly flew off the bus after a short \"best friend hug.\" She saw Percy chortle as she left, looking down on her with some bemusement now.<br>\r\n\"Follow me, 'mam\" said the soldier, leading Eve through the barricade towards a small tent. Eve flew inside, and finding an empty table and chairs, sat down there.<br>\r\n\"Make yourself comfortable\" said the soldier \"I'll go fetch the general.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve rolled her eyes as the young soldier left and looked around the camp with her powers. It was quite clear that many of the soldiers didn't really know why they were there, and the few who knew that the \"operation\" was about Eve weren't really sure what Eve had done wrong. Eventually, Eve spotted the general strolling towards the tent. It turned out he was quite a young man, tall and blonde, and that apparently he was allowed to drink a bottle of whisky on the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve\" said the general, entering and taking a seat quickly, his hazel eyes darting about \"Good to meet you. You really are as attractive as they all keep saying - for a young girl, I mean.\"<br>\r\n\"You want to ask me out on a date too?\" asked Eve calmly.<br>\r\n\"Actually, no\" said the general kindly \"We have more important matters to attend to. The global geopolitical situation is quite fragile, as you know. The world has a lot of crime right now and we're doing our part to help fight it. That means mobilizing every resource we have at our disposal. In some places, this is quite challenging. There is no question that the criminal underworld is more powerful than we are, in aggregate. Additionally, in the last year we've waged many wars, as you know. The world is a dangerous place. But with you on our side, we could put an end to crime and bring about world peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me - to fight for you?\" asked Eve.<br>\r\n\"Not just that\" said the general \"I'll be honest - what we're really after is your DNA. We had some covert forensic experts check the dairy yesterday, but have been unable to locate a usable sample. It seems that your cells break down extremely quickly when they leave your body. Therefore we must sequence the DNA from a sample inside your body - which will probably just mean looking inside your mouth and doing some quick tests on your saliva.\"<br>\r\nEve sat back with a smile, putting her silver boots up on the table. \"Tell me, general\" said Eve \"What's it to you? What would you do with my DNA?\"<br>\r\nThe general shrugged. \"Well - if you must know, we want to study it and use it to create super soldiers\" he said plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want me to help you conquer the world\" said Eve \"As well as fight crime, like I'm already doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Basically, yes\" said the general \"You could be an extremely valuable asset to this military and this country, Eve. Won't you pitch in and help us out?\"<br>\r\nEve sighed and put her boots down. \"What do I get in return?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"That's the best part\" replied the general \"Anything you want. Want gold? Hot guys? Want to be worshipped as a goddess? Want to become president? Want us to design you a better costume? Every person in the world your personal slave? I can make it all happen, and more. All I ask in return is to be allowed to look for a couple of minutes into your mouth with a team of scientists and instruments. You'll hardly even notice it. When the world has been subdued, there'll be no stopping us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offer certainly was tempting. Eve sat back and considered it for a moment. Although the terms were good, she wasn't sure if she could trust the general. After all, if there were many copies of her loyal to the general and just one of her, the general wouldn't really have to keep to the terms at all anymore once the world was his. She also wasn't sure that it was the best course of action. Somehow the idea of choosing one nation to rule the entire world doesn't sit right with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry general\" she said at last with a sigh \"I'll fight crime, and I'll bring world peace, but you have to let me do it my way.\"<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\" asked the general incredulously.<br>\r\n\"General, you've become corrupted by power, I think\" continued Eve \"I too share many of the same ideals, but you don't need to rule the world with an iron fist to achieve them. You can still have freedom. You saw the power in me and your immediate instinct is that you have to control it. Soon you want to control the whole world with some super army. And that's why I don't trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general stood up and took a swig of whisky. Soldiers standing in the background seemed to waver a little. \"Good speech\" one of them whispered to another. Eve, for her part, was still relaxing in her chair with her boots up.<br>\r\n\"So that's how it will be, is it?\" said the general \"You fool! You could have had everything your heart desired for all eternity, but you turned it away. Well, I won't let you go to have you work for the enemy! I'll make sure you're dead before that. Men! Open fire on her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers surrounded her and pointed their guns, but seemed reluctant to pull the triggers.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, men? I said open fire!\" cried the general, drinking more whisky.<br>\r\n\"But general, she has super strength\" pointed out one of the soldiers.<br>\r\n\"Does it look like I care?\" replied the general, enraged \"Obey your orders, men! Open fire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat reluctantly, one of the men started shooting. When he started, all the others did as well. Eve barely felt anything as the bullets bounced off her solid, super strong body. She did take her feet off the table and sat up a little, though.<br>\r\n\"General! Our guns have no effect!\" cried a soldier.<br>\r\n\"Pull back! Regroup!\" yelled the general \"Bring in the tank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh - actually\" said Eve \"I'm sort of late for school now.\"<br>\r\n\"If you go to school, we'll fire a missile at the school. Heck, I have no problem with launching a nuclear weapon against this town. You got that?\"<br>\r\nAt that, Eve stood up and suddenly flew over to the general, looking him right into the eye. Something about the way he'd threatened to attack innocent people really got her riled up and made her angry. \"Don't... you... dare...\" said Eve, feeling a mix of frustration and raw power bubbling up to the surface inside her \"You take that back, right now, or you'll regret it.\"<br>\r\n\"Never!\" shouted the general, the heavy smell of alcohol on his breath \"Give me what I want, or I'll make you regret it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving at super speeds and thinking quickly, Eve picked up each soldier, carried them to the park, gave them a wedgie, and hung them from some of the taller park trees by their underwear. She then took each of their guns that they had used to shoot her just moments before, and crushed them into a large ball. Then, finally, she ran back right in front of the general. All this happened in a fraction of a second, and the next thing he knew, the general heard various painful howls coming from the park, calling to be let down from the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to intimidate me by hanging up my men!\" howled the general \"I'll launch the weapons personally if I have to!\"<br>\r\nEve stared at the general angrily. \"You just don't get it, do you general? I'm probably the last person you want to be making threats to. Those guys were just acting under orders. I don't mind that so much. What I mind is people like you who try to kill an innocent young girl for no reason - and then threaten to blow up her school, and her whole town!\"<br>\r\n\"You don't scare me!\" said the general, taking another swig of his whisky bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve shrugged, then stopped herself. \"You're just a drunk, sad man\" she said, composing herself \"I won't hurt you.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course you won't!\" yelled the general \"You're just a dumb bitch!\"<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Eve continued \"But I will warn you - if you fire any sort of missile or weapon around here, my super senses will pick up on it, and I will turn that weapon around and throw it back at you. You know I can do that.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" shouted the general, sauntering back and pressing a big red button \"Go ahead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately a large rocket fired in the general direction of the school building. With a supernatural reaction speed, Eve ran up to the rocket as it fired and, with absolutely no effort, deflected the rocket harmlessly into the sky. She also permanently disabled every piece of military equipment the general had with him before running back in front of the general. Eve and the general both watched as the rocket flew up and exploded harmlessly somewhere in the upper atmosphere a minute or so later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are you going to do with me?\" asked the general \"You'd never hurt me!\"<br>\r\n\"No, but I was going to give you a second warning as well\" continued Eve \"Your talk was quite boring, so just before, I used my super vision powers to read through much of one of my new law textbooks while you were blabbering on. Turns out you're in violation of at least 15 statutes and 24 military codes. So- I must warn you that even if I won't hurt you, maybe the full force of the law will knock some sense into you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing the general knew, Eve had used her powers again to carry him to the police station, and write up a short legal paper detailing his crimes in a super short span of time.<br>\r\n\"He's all yours, officers\" said Eve sweetly to the policemen as the general looked on with horror written on his face.<br>\r\n\"You? You're that superhero?\" asked one of the officers.<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" said another officer \"She stopped the robbery yesterday!\"<br>\r\n\"The name's Eve\" replied Eve \"Oh and, next time the army comes to town, keep a close eye on them, ok? This man literally just tried to blow up the town.\"<br>\r\n\"We're glad to have a superhero on our side!\" said one officer \"Leave him with us. In the meantime, can we get a photo with you?\"<br>\r\nEve shrugged. \"OK, but make it quick. I've got to get back to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll regret this!\" yelled the general as he was led away \"We could have ruled the world, you and I! I just know you're going to regret this!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before she went back to class, Eve went off to the park to let down all the soldiers whom she had hung up. \"Sorry everyone\" she said \"I kind of lost my temper there.\"<br>\r\n\"That's ok, I think we all understand\" replied one of the soldiers.<br>\r\n\"It was our fault really, no need to apologize\" added another.<br>\r\n\"Maybe we'll get a new, better general now!\" chimed in another.<br>\r\n\"I thought it was really awesome to see what you can do in action!\" said yet another excitedly, to which all the soldiers agreed. Eve looked away shyly.<br>\r\n\"Aww, don't look away\" said another soldier, as he hoisted Eve up and seated her on his shoulders \"Three cheers for Eve!\"<br>\r\n\"Hip hip! Hooray! Hip hip! Hooray! Hip hip! Hooray!\" cheered the soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry, but I have to get back to school again now\" said Eve, flying up off the soldier's shoulders.<br>\r\n\"Aww\" said the soldiers in unison.<br>\r\n\"But I know I'll see you all again. Keep fighting crime and I'll help out when I can, ok?\"<br>\r\nAt this all the soldiers cheered and Eve flew off to the school, feeling great again. It seemed to her like whenever she became angry she lost control of herself a bit but her powers became stronger, while helping people out seemed to both make her powers stronger and increase her ability to control them. Either way her powers just seemed to become stronger whenever she used them, which she loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later the principal was leading her to an old disused room, in which he had set up a small desk for Eve to work at.<br>\r\n\"Sorry we have to do this\" he said \"There aren't a lot of spare rooms in the school, this was the best one I could find.\"<br>\r\n\"I understand\" replied Eve, flying into the room.<br>\r\n\"Your books are over there\" explained the principal \"If you need anything, just come by my office\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve couldn't wait to get started. One by one she worked through all the papers. She soon realized that not only was she moving superhumanly fast as she worked, but she was actually thinking extremely fast too. Although she had four days to do a year's worth of material in the twenty or so papers she had been enrolled in, she completed it all in a matter of minutes. She even did her end of year exams right then and there, since using her super vision she already could see the questions, and using her super intelligence she already knew the answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to fly off to the principal's office to ask him for more work, but then she stopped herself, realizing that this would be a prime opportunity to practice her powers. She began by practicing flying speed and agility, flying in complicated loops around the room at faster and faster speeds. She was really starting to get the hang of that, eventually stopping herself just before she exceeded the sound barrier for fear of giving herself away. She then revised invisibility, practicing turning herself invisible and back instantly, which again came to her quite naturally. Satisfied, Eve breathed out heavily, even though she wasn't at all tired, just out of habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did, she noticed something odd. In her breath, there was a single, tiny ice particle. Finding it strange, Eve breathed on to the window, concentrating a little on making her breath cold. To her surprise, soon enough, the whole window was covered in ice almost immediately. Curiously, Eve tried breathing something a little warmer. At first she surprised herself by making just a few flames come out of her mouth, but soon, with a little mental effort, she managed to breathe flames enough to melt the ice. Her flames caused a small fire in the classroom, but she used her ice breath to put it out before the smoke detector noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome\" she whispered to herself \"Super breath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve took another deep breath in, and began practicing alternating between hot and cold breath. As with invisibility, this power seemed to come quite naturally to her. After only a few practices she was pretty confident that she could easily breathe both fire and ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve began to wonder what else her lungs were capable of doing. The next thing she tried was blowing. Securing all her school papers, Eve exhaled quite hard, the force of her breath causing the whole room to shake and knocking almost everything over. Quickly Eve stopped herself before the windows smashed. In another experiment she tried to blow only through a very small gap in her mouth very quickly, creating an effect similar to an airgun. She then combined that with her ice and fire breath, shooting small bullets of ice and fire through the air, starting small fires and putting them out just as quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a bit of fun, Eve decided to make an ice sculpture. Using her ice breath she first made a solid block of ice on top of her desk, and then she used her fire breath to strategically melt small parts of it away. It wasn't long before she had made an accurate scale model of the colosseum in Rome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bored, Eve turned invisible and flew out of the classroom unnoticed. Finding a nice cloud, she blew on it, sending it a safe distance away from the town. Then she used her ice breath to turn it to a thundercloud, and her fire breath to melt all the rain again in an instant, causing a sudden heavy downpour below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve flew about happily, testing her new breathing powers as much as she could. She remembered that some superheroes apparently had the ability to breathe things other than air. Eve wondered if that was part of her super breathing ability too, and her instinct told her that she could. First, she tried for outer space. Flying up quickly, she found that her instinct was, in fact, right - she was still breathing. What exactly she was breathing she wasn't sure. It was almost as though her lungs were generating their own air. Next she tried flying down to the ocean, breathing underwater. Again, she breathed as freely as if she was on dry land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to tell Jess and Sophie about this\" whispered Eve excitedly as she flew back towards the school for lunch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Eve once again waited at the cafeteria she was met by Ryan, the captain of her soccer team.<br>\r\n\"Hey Eve\" he said \"Wow you look...\"<br>\r\n\"I know\" interjected Eve \"I get told that a lot nowadays. I'll add you to the list of boys who want to date me.\"<br>\r\nRyan smiled happily. \"Thanks so much Eve! You're the best! Though, actually I'm here to talk to you about our team's game tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh? What about it?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, we're not sure if you should be allowed to play. Since you have powers and all, you're a lot better than the rest of us. There's the potential for injury, especially unintended injury. And also, soccer doesn't even have rules for using superpowers. Like, is it fair to fly with the ball? So we've sent something through to the regional authority, but until we get word from them that it's ok for you, coach thinks it's better if you sit this one out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve looked down, a little saddened. \"So... I might not be able to play soccer anymore now that I have powers? That... kind of sucks.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" said Ryan \"You were a good player. I'm not sure how we'll replace you. We can still go on a date sometime, though, right?\"<br>\r\nEve shrugged. \"Sure, I guess.\"<br>\r\nWith that, Ryan went away celebrating. \"Thank you so much!\" he called to Eve as he practically danced away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't help but overhear\" said Emma, shuffling up to Eve \"That you can't play soccer anymore. So... does this mean you'll have time now for the cheerleading thing? I think we're probably one of the few superhuman-friendly codes.\"<br>\r\nEve rolled her eyes. \"I'll think about it\" she reiterated.<br>\r\n\"Great! Well, let me know soon. We're just about to start work on some new routines and it would be sooooo amazing if you could join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Eve got her gigantic lunch and quickly found Jessica and Sophie.<br>\r\n\"Hey Eve\" said Jessica \"What was that thing with the military?\"<br>\r\nEve laughed. \"Just some general who got a bit carried away and tried to blow everyone up. He's on remand right now at the police station - I turned him in. Speaking of blowing things though, you'll never guess what new power I just got.\"<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Jessica.<br>\r\nEve blew gently on to her glass of water, causing ice cubes to form on it. \"Super breath!\"<br>\r\n\"Neat!\" said Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of super, my class was super boring this morning\" said Sophie \"I can't wait - four more days and then it's holidays at last!\"<br>\r\n\"You doing anything fun?\" asked Jessica.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Luxury cruise around the pacific islands, here I come!\" replied Sophie.<br>\r\n\"My parents are taking me on a ski trip\" said Jessica \"I'm so excited!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh\" said Eve quietly \"That sure does sound like fun.\"<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Eve? More superhero practice?\" asked Sophie.<br>\r\n\"I think so, yeah\" sighed Eve.<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that's way cooler than what I'm doing\" said Sophie \"I can barely imagine how great it must be to be you.\"<br>\r\n\"And you can visit us on our trips at any time\" pointed out Jessica \"And we'll keep in touch by phone and such.\"<br>\r\nEve smiled. \"Thanks\" she said \"You two are the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Eve noticed that Jack was sitting alone on a table by himself. Percy, still wearing the neck-brace, and his goons marched over to him.<br>\r\n\"Hey retard!\" Percy said to Jack \"What are you doing, nerd? You know the rules. Pay the nerd tax or get out of my school.\"<br>\r\n\"But my dad said if I gave you my lunch money again...\" began Jack, but he stopped when Percy put his fist right in front of Jack's face.<br>\r\n\"You damn well know better than to listen to your father over me\" said Percy angrily \"Who are you going to listen to? The guy who spent most of your life in prison, or the guy who GENEROUSLY let's you get away with being a retarded loser in my school? You know I could waste you in a fight, so don't even try this kind of thing again. Who do you think you're kidding, nerd? You're the biggest weakling in the whole school, so you'll probably \"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" said Jack defiantly \"Well, my girlfriend could waste YOU in a fight, so there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, I'm going to have to excuse myself\" said Eve quickly, feeling her sense of duty coming up again.<br>\r\n\"Ooo\" remarked Sophie excitedly \"Fighting some bad guys? Can I watch.\"<br>\r\n\"No\" groaned Eve \"It's just Percy thinking he runs the school again.\"<br>\r\n\"Even better!\" said Jessica excitedly \"You show Percy who's the boss! Best friend hug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls hugged together quickly, just as Eve saw that Percy was about to punch Jack in his jaw. Just as Eve was about to run at super speeds across the room to block the punch, however, Eve suddenly found herself already standing exactly where she wanted to stand, between Percy and Jack. Jack flinched massively behind her and fell right into his food, almost breaking the table, causing many students around him to laugh. Percy and Eve, however, just stared each other down. As they did so, Eve realized that she must have grown a little taller again as well, now being at eye level with Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's true then\" muttered Percy \"You really are that loser's girlfriend, freak?\"<br>\r\n\"No\" replied Eve calmly \"He's not my boyfriend. He's just somebody I gave an interview to yesterday.\"<br>\r\nJack looked at Eve with a glance of betrayal. Then suddenly he ran away through the crowd, crying loudly.<br>\r\n\"But that does not mean\" continued Eve \"That you have the right to mock, belittle or demand money from him. And if you can't get that through your skull, then I hope you remember the warning I gave you yesterday. I'd do the same to protect any student here.\"<br>\r\nPercy muttered something about freaks, but he turned away, giving Eve one last scathing look, and went back to his buddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this the whole room cheered, and Eve flew up to allow the other students to admire her. Loudest of all were the cheers of Jessica and Sophie. Still, Eve wondered how she had moved in front of Percy so fast. Had she really teleported?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve decided that this was as good an opportunity as any to find out. Closing her eyes, she simply visualized herself flying at Jack's side, noting that Jack was currently alone in one of the classrooms, crying to himself. Sure enough, when she opened her eyes again, there she was, flying besides Jack exactly as she had imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?\" asked Eve \"You alright?\"<br>\r\n\"Go away!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Jack. It's just...\"<br>\r\n\"Just what? It's all my fault. I made you look bad. You're far too good for me even if last night wasn't just some wet dream I had. I don't know why everyone else in the school is obsessed with you now too, but I need to learn to move on. I'm sorry Eve.\"<br>\r\nEve giggled. \"Jack, last night was completely real. You're the only boy I've ever dated, last night was my first kiss. I'm sorry that I don't consider you my boyfriend after just one short interview, but I'd like you to be my boyfriend. How about we make it official tonight?\"<br>\r\n\"You really mean that?\" asked Jack, looking up to Eve with tears in his eyes \"I know I'll never be good enough for an alien goddess like you but...\"<br>\r\n\"Stop that\" interrupted Eve sternly \"I actually really liked how you stood up for yourself before. I could have any boy in the world, but when you're being confident, there's nobody I'd rather be with than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jack threw his arms around Eve and hugged her tightly, still crying a little into her shoulder.<br>\r\n\"One thing's for sure\" said Eve gently, hugging Jack back \"If you're with me or not, you and everyone else at this school won't ever have to pay Percy's nerd tax again.\"<br>\r\nJack smiled at this, his eyes drying up a little, as he pulled out of the hug awkwardly. \"I love you\" he whispered \"So much more than you know.\"<br>\r\nEve simply smiled warmly and tousled Jack's hair, before teleporting back to her friends to finish her lunch - but not before tidying up the mess that had been made when Jack fell over and bringing Jack some of her own food at super speeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls\" said Eve excitedly \"You won't believe it! I JUST got a new power! I can teleport now!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When lunch was over, Eve did a quick patrol around the school, ensuring that students weren't breaking any school rules, before returning to her otherwise vacant room. As she flew in, she noticed a bunch of students had left her love notes under her door. She read them all quickly, before filing them away in one of the desks in the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" said Eve to herself \"I'm going to need a space where I can practice my powers...\"<br>\r\nBlowing quickly around the room, Eve coated everything in a thick layer of ice, holding it all tightly in place, and sealing the room off.<br>\r\n\"Time to get started\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve first warmed up by practicing her new teleportation power all over the place. She was soon teleporting across the room quite naturally. She began to wonder if the powers she had received recently were just easier to control, or whether she was getting better at using her powers through practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have much of an oppertunity to consider the thought, however, as soon her super-senses picked up on another crime in progress - an arsonist had just struck the local department store. Looking around the store, she saw in shock that the roof was just about to collapse, and there were people still trapped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing quickly, Eve blew fire around the room just enough to evaporate the ice, leaving the whole room thick with hot steam, before rapidly breathing some cold breath to normalize the temperature. She blew the resulting heavy cloud out of the room into the corridor, leaving it to dissipate there. Then, in a flash, she teleported right into the burning building just as she noticed part of the roof was about to collapse on some poor shop clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just in time!\" he shouted to Eve \"I'm trapped! Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve flew across to him and lifted the collapsing roof above him with ease. \"Don't worry, sir\" she said \"You focus on freeing yourself - I'll protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve then noticed a guy unable to get out because of the heavy smoke. He was choking and needed urgent help, which made Eve appreciate how easily her super eyes could see through the smoke. Using her super breath, Eve solved the problem by blowing the smoke away, while still holding up much of the roof. Just then, however, Eve saw at the other end of the store that a kid in a wheelchair was trying to get out, but the wheelchair access ramp was blocked by flaming debris. Just then, a huge burning fan that had been hanging from the roof fell down. Eve wondered what she could do to help but she was too preoccupied with holding the roof up to hold up the fan as well. With her breath out, and not able to think of a solution in time, Eve's eyes grew wide with horror, and she wished that somehow, the fan could be held up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner did she think it, than a shimmering force field appeared right above the trapped kid, holding up the fan easily. \"Did I just get another power?\" she whispered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much time for reflection though. Realizing the fire appliances were still too far away, Eve realized that she'd have to do quite a bit of work herself if she wanted to save much of the store, as well as the lives of the dozen or so people still trapped inside. First she used her super strength to crush the section of roof that was collapsing, allowing the smoke to escape more easily. Then, she began running around the room at super speeds, using her ice breath to counter the flames and blow out the fire everywhere. The people inside just saw a small white blur, and a few moments later, the heat was all gone and the smoke started to clear. With a little super blowing from Eve to get the smoke out, the store was actually quite chilly. Eve also freed everyone who was trapped by clearing the debris using her super strength, her muscles bulging out a little as she worked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that shimmering thing above that kids head?\" asked one of the crowd of people who were once trapped inside, now gathered around Eve.<br>\r\n\"Oh, ummm... that's a force-field, I guess\" said Eve. Finding a small half-burnt soft toy, she threw it against the force-field to demonstrate, and it turned out exactly as Eve had thought - the toy bounced off it. Eve then tried concentrating on removing the force field, and... this time she failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you make it go away again?\" asked the middle manager.<br>\r\n\"Hold on a moment, I'm trying\" said Eve \"New power - might take me a moment to learn to control this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd backed away a bit in case something bad happened. One of the braver civilians helped the kid in the wheelchair get away as well. Meanwhile, Eve concentrated harder and harder, but removing the field was tougher than she thought. She also tried using her super strength, but that only allowed her to move the force field or change its shape, not to destroy it completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it!\" cheered the boy in the wheelchair \"I believe in you Eve!\"<br>\r\nJust then some very confused fire fighters turned up. \"What happened here?\" asked one of them.<br>\r\n\"Shhh!\" said the crowd in unison, watching as Eve concentrated. Getting the hint, the firefighters started working on the clean-up very quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour or so of intense concentration, the force field began to shimmer a little as Eve concentrated harder on it. This roused the audience, captivated, and made them cheer harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, just as school ended, Eve did it. The force field shimmered softer and softer until eventually it wasn't there any more at all. The crowd cheered exceptionally loudly. Panting a little from the intense mental effort, Eve flew down and signed a few autographs for her fans in the crowd. \"Guess I need to practice that force-field power a little more\" she told them sweetly.<br>\r\n\"You're doing a great job, you know\" said a firefighter \"Without you, most of these people would be dead.\"<br>\r\n\"Well you do a great job yourself\" replied Eve \"I'm just some kid with some powers - you save lives every day for a living with no powers. That takes a lot of courage!\"<br>\r\nAnd with that the crowd cheered the firefighters also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the local park, the arsonist had just dumped an empty bottle of gasoline into the local river, watching as the heavy bottle sank to the bottom. When he turned around again to leave, however, Eve had just teleported there to meet him.<br>\r\n\"Oh, ummm - hello, cutie\" he said, looking around shiftily.<br>\r\nEve looked at him sternly. \"If you were looking to get my attention you could have just asked. Now I'm afraid I'll have to send you to jail.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh\" said the man, still looking around shiftily \"Well, uh...\" and with that, he suddenly punched Eve and tried to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve barely even felt the punch through her super strong body. She rapidly flew up, picked up the man by his coat, and tossed him into the river, leaving him soaking wet. \"That's for punching me!\" she laughed as the man splashed about.<br>\r\nThen she picked up the man again and carried him at super speeds to the police station. \"And this\" she added, handing a quickly written statement to the officers there \"Is for setting on fire the department store, almost killing hundreds of people.\"<br>\r\n\"Two major crimes in one day?\" asked a police officer.<br>\r\n\"Just doing my duty\" saluted Eve with a smile and a wink, before teleporting away again back to school, just in the nick of time to make the school bus and catch up with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was your afternoon?\" asked Jessica.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god... you will not believe this!\" said Eve excitedly.<br>\r\nSophie and Jessica looked at each other. \"Actually Eve, with the sorts of amazing adventures you've been on recently, I'm pretty much ready to believe anything you say you did at this point\" shrugged Sophie honestly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eve's bus arrived without incident, and as she left, Eve happily noted that Percy didn't seem to be in the mood to disturb anybody. Quickly flying home, she was just about to retrieve the key from under the rock out of habit, before remembering that she could just teleport inside now. Doing so, she hopped on the couch and decided to take a break after a long day full of heroics. Using her super vision powers she started catching up on a few of her favorite TV shows which she'd been missing in the last few days where she'd been too busy due to her new abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later Eve's mother arrived. At first Eve flew up to greet her in the garage but then suddenly she felt a strange ringing in her ear. Her eyes began to blur and fog over, and her flight seemed to give out too. As her mother came closer, a strange tingling filled her body, which became increasingly painful the closer her mother came. Eve tried to scream in agony but found that her voice wasn't there anymore. She could barely still move and was suddenly having trouble breathing. Through her blurred eyes she could see that even her young, beautiful body was slowly transforming into an old, ugly one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve had almost forgotten what pain felt like ever since she became super strong, but this was unlike any pain she'd ever felt before. \"Help\" she managed to get out \"Help, mum...\" and then she started choking. Her heart started beating quite irregularly too. And then, through her blurred vision, she could just see that her mom was carrying a small black stone in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This little stone is the xenotime I told you about earlier\" said her mother \"It's effects should be obvious - it reverses all your powers. The more super you are, the weaker you become when xenotime is around. Your strength, your vision, even your super beauty disappear when xenotime is around, and are replaced by their opposites - exceptional weakness, poor vision and ugliness. And if this stone were to ever touch you, you would die instantly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he mother sealed the stone inside a small protective case of solid steel, and Eve was able to breathe again, gasping loudly and holding her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing you can do about it, before you ask\" added her mother \"There is no way you can get immunity to the stone. Even when you become otherwise omnipotent, your powers will have no effect if you try to use them on the stone or around it.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow\" gasped Eve \"That's way more powerful than Kryptonite.\"<br>\r\nHer mother smiled and hugged Eve gently, as Eve felt her strength return quite quickly, her eyesight clear, her body changing back to its former beautiful glory. \"It's alright, Eve\" replied her mother \"You're much more powerful than superman after all.\"<br>\r\n\"So what you're saying, mom, is that I'll be omnipotent in every respect, once I develop my full powers, except that I will always be helpless against the stone?\" asked Eve, to clarify.<br>\r\n\"Yes. The stone is the one thing that can always destroy you Eve. But then again, you can protect yourself against the stone's power a little, too. As long as you stay away from it you should be fine.\"<br>\r\n\"So mom - how rare is xenotime anyway?\" asked Eve.<br>\r\nHer mother shrugged. \"It's quite rare. You don't just see it lying around\" she said \"But it is easily obtainable. You can buy a crystal like this one on the internet for about a thousand or two thousand dollars. Like diamonds really. The purified crystals are the ones to worry about - impurities, which are very common, make xenotime exponentially less effective against you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve sulked a little. \"I was really looking forward to that unlimited power thing!\" she said \"This all makes my powers seem kind of ... limited.\"<br>\r\nHer mother laughed. \"Did Superman give up because of Kryptonite? No, he fought harder. In the end, as some Chinese philosopher once said, the love of the people is always your strongest defence. Make people like you, and then nobody will ever want to hurt you with xenotime or anything else. Your powers are a gift, Eve. Use them wisely and make yourself worthy of them. I just want you to know what being around the stone does to you and your body, so that you can be prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh - who on Earth do you think you are?\" asked the General, who was nursing something of a hangover with more whisky, of the shadowy figure in the interrogation room at the police station.<br>\r\n\"I am the secretary\" replied the secretary calmly with her cold, empty-sounding female voice \"I'm here to talk to you about the little girl who put you here.\"<br>\r\n\"You want to talk to me about Eve?\" asked the General, slamming his fists on the interrogation room's table \"That stupid little...\"<br>\r\n\"I understand your frustration, General\" replied the secretary \"And I have a plan to destroy her, but I could use your help. Your pay will be handsome. When she is gone, the world shall be ours to rule. Everything is now in place. World domination is within my reach, but I am a cautious villain. I will not proceed until she is destroyed.\"<br>\r\nThe general shrugged. \"How can I help? I'm in prison.\"<br>\r\nAt this the secretary shifted uncomfortably. \"I'm afraid I cannot reveal the master plan here\" she whispered \"I just need you to trust me on this. After all, think of all the power I'm promising you. The power to rule the whole world. And more importantly, you'll at last be able to get the revenge I know you so deeply desire.\"<br>\r\nThe general sighed. \"Alright\" he said \"I'll help you. Tell me what I need to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening after dinner, where her mother concluded that Eve was indeed now immune to all kinds of poison and disease following one last field trial, Eve was flying above her house, practicing removing force-fields she created. It was not getting any easier. She was still having to concentrate for hours, sometimes, to remove a force-field. She was still practicing with little progress as the sun set and into the night, until her mother finally called her in right after she'd cleared another force-field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom\" she said slyly as she flew down \"I think I have a new super power. It's called super not needing sleep.\"<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter\" replied her mother \"It's still your bedtime.\"<br>\r\nEve sighed and, at super speeds, got herself ready for bed. She did, however, take a normal speed shower, at which point she noticed her body proportions had changed again, becoming increasingly curvy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom\" said Eve as her mother tucked her in \"Other than the fact that I'm developing all these super powers, have you noticed anything... strange recently? About me I mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Not really\" replied her mother.<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just... I know my breasts are still quite flat, but it's a lot of growth for one day, I think.\"<br>\r\n\"It probably just seems that way to you now, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n\"I've also been getting taller and... well, I've been having feelings for this boy...\"<br>\r\n\"All normal parts of puberty\" shrugged her mother as she turned off the light \"You'll get used to it. Just wait until you have periods.\"<br>\r\n\"Mom, do you think it's possible... maybe I'm going through puberty a bit faster with all these powers?\"<br>\r\nHer mother thought for a moment. \"It's possible\" she said at last \"But I'm sure it will still take many years either way. I wouldn't be too concerned about it. Just focus now on developing your powers - and on going to sleep. Good night sweetheart.\"<br>\r\nEve pretended to yawn. \"Good night mom\" she said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once again, Eve wasn't really the slightest bit interested in going to sleep. Looking through her own eyelids with her supervision, she watched as her mother went back downstairs, and listened in as she got busy placing an order for a new table by hire-purchase. To avoid any kind of suspicion by inadvertent noise-making, Eve teleported out of the home before flying off in the direction of Jack's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw Jack with her powers, in his bedroom waiting for her. Like her, he had clearly pretended to go to sleep, but was now dressed in a cute little suit and holding a white rose in front of him, clearly waiting to surprise Eve when she arrived. Chuckling cunningly to herself, Eve teleported silently into the house so that she was right behind Jack before lightly tapping him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack almost screamed in fright, dropping his rose and falling backwards as he spun around seeing Eve. Flying quickly, Eve scooped him and his flower up, lifting him with ease. \"You ready?\" she asked in an excited whisper.<br>\r\nJack was still in shock for a moment, shaking heavily, but eventually he managed to nod. Eve gently put Jack back on his feet to compose himself, while she got to work on quietly opening the window. When it was open, she quietly whispered \"Let's go\" before picking Jack up and flying off into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" asked Jack, nervously hanging on to Eve tightly as the two pre-teens soared higher and higher into the sky.<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" asked Eve playfully \"Check out how cool all the lights look from up here though.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah... pretty sweet...\" replied Jack, still shaking \"Hey Eve, it's really cold up here - can we go back down a little bit?\"<br>\r\nEve sighed, forgetting about her apparent immunity to extreme heat or cold. \"Sorry! I forgot about that!\" she replied, flying a little further down \"Hey - want to sneak into the cinema?\"<br>\r\nJack looked a little unsure but eventually relented after thinking about it for a moment. \"Sure\" he said, to which Eve smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he knew, Eve had carried him at super speeds to a late screening of a romantic comedy film. Looking around, he found that not only had Eve taken him to some of the best seats in the house, but she had also procured a large packet of popcorn, a selection of drinks and some sweets for him as well. Eve was sitting on the seat beside him, but leant in to him a little. \"Say, is that flower for me?\" she whispered.<br>\r\n\"Oh, errrm - yeah\" replied Jack, quickly presenting it \"I'm sorry it's not much but...\"<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful\" said Eve, examining it before taking it from him \"I love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while into the movie, one of the ushers at the cinema suddenly shone the torch at both of them. Immediately Eve turned herself invisible in a panic, leaving Jack to tumble and spill one of his drinks across the floor.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here? Do you have a ticket?\" asked the usher.<br>\r\n\"I... I... I'm sorry, I...\" began Jack, on the verge of crying.<br>\r\nJust then Eve re-appeared behind the usher. \"Hey Peter, how's it going?\" asked Eve.<br>\r\n\"Eve? You're the girl who saved my marriage last night!\" replied Peter.<br>\r\n\"The one and only\" replied Eve, striking a cool superhero pose she'd been practicing.<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much\" said Peter \"Hey, could you help me out again? This kid's been sneaking into the theater.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, him?\" replied Eve, flying over to Jack's side and holding his hand \"He's with me. We're out on our first date.\"<br>\r\n\"Aww, you two look cute together\" said Peter \"Alright Eve, I do owe you one, so I'll let you off the hook this time. Just remember to ask first next time, ok?\"<br>\r\nEve smiled, her beautiful eyes gleaming in the usher's torchlight. \"Sure thing\" said Eve \"Let me know if you ever need me again, too. Bye!\"<br>\r\nPeter smiled back before moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close\" sighed Jack \"Why didn't you rescue me and get out of here?\"<br>\r\nEve shrugged and hugged him. \"I wanted to finish the movie\" she said before munching away on one of the candy bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the movie was over, Eve took Jack back to the park. Jack was quite tired and full of candy but still holding up admirably.<br>\r\n\"Eve?\" asked Jack as the two lay next to each other, basking in the full moonlight.<br>\r\n\"Yeah Jack?\" asked Eve.<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much\" replied Jack \"I hope my teeth are ok after all that chocolate though.\"<br>\r\nEve giggled. \"I hope you don't mind\" she said \"I made a couple of million little force-fields inside your mouth, protecting your teeth. You won't have to worry about tooth decay from now on.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow\" said Jack quietly, half-yawning.<br>\r\n\"So sleepyhead\" said Eve, playfully knocking Jack's shoulder \"You got any other questions you'd like to ask the world's greatest superheroine?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\" said Jack, quickly collecting himself and saying the first thing that came to his mind. \"So are you... are you, like... my girlfriend now?\"<br>\r\nEve chuckled. \"Sure, I guess. I might still date around a bit, but you're by far the best boy I know.\"<br>\r\n\"So I noticed you're not in class anymore? What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"More advanced papers from the university - easy stuff, really. Mostly I'm out saving the day or practicing my powers.\"<br>\r\n\"What's your coolest power?\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm - my ice breath is pretty cool. Jokes aside, all my powers are the best.\"<br>\r\n\"Is it true you could destroy the planet in the blink of an eye?\"<br>\r\nEve tapped her super muscular arms. \"Of course. But I would never do that.\"<br>\r\n\"Well then I think you're literally perfect\" marvelled Jack \"I mean, you don't have any weaknesses or anything, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve stopped. \"Well, ummm....\" she began \"Maybe I do have one?\"<br>\r\nJack looked at her curiously. \"Oh? What is it?\"<br>\r\nFor a long moment Eve considered telling Jack the truth, but then she realized that even if she knew he was genuine, she was too afraid of anybody finding out about her true weakness to say anything. \"It's nothing really\" she eventually said.<br>\r\n\"Come on\" replied Jack.<br>\r\n\"Honestly, come of think of it\" said Eve playfully \"I think my biggest weakness might just be how much I really like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack smiled warmly and, although tired, he and Eve both gave in to instinct. Their heads drew closer and closer together as they gazed deeply into each others eyes, warm breath from their mouths mixing in the rapidly narrowing air between them, before suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness, is that the time?\" said Eve, moving back alarmed as she noticed the town clock out of the corner of her supervision \"I'm really sorry Jack, but I'm going to have to bring you back to bed.\"<br>\r\nJack looked outraged. \"But Eve, I'm not even tried\" he said tiredly \"Can't we just stay here?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope, I have urgent superhero business to attend to\" replied Eve \"Got a note last night to meet somebody, and I get the vibe that they're not a good guy.\"<br>\r\n\"Can't I come watch?\"<br>\r\n\"No, you're too tired anyway\" said Eve, who by now had already carried Jack into his bedroom and deposited him in his bed at super speeds \"I'll tell you how it went tomorrow\".<br>\r\n\"But Eve...\" began Jack, before Eve silence him with another quick kiss on his cheek. Once again, Jack was too stunned to say anything as Eve smiled and teleported away, attaching the rose to her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now for my next appointment\" said Eve to herself as she flew towards the interstate bridge \"Time to find out who the secretary is.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eve flew out to the bridge and scanned around with her superpowered eyes. At first she assumed the mysterious secretary was held up or something, but then she saw that she was a few minutes early, and that a small boat was approaching the bridge carrying just one person on it, watching her as she flew. Something about her look made Eve quite sure that she was the person who wanted to meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary was an attractive middle-aged redhead with lightly freckled skin. She was quite tall and had cold grey eyes that rarely seemed to blink. Her outfit was a neat and tidy business dress, and she carried with her a small black leather handbag, inside of which Eve could see a small handgun and some money. Eve flew over and landed at the rear of the boat, which seemed to be a small fishing charter. The two stared at each other as the redhead turned off the boat engine and waited for the noise to die down. A slight breeze whipped up both of their hair and made the whole scene seem very tense. In the distance, a storm cloud seemed to be raging and lightning cracked violently across the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the secretary?\" asked Eve at last.<br>\r\n\"Indeed\" replied the secretary quickly, cautiously walking towards Eve.<br>\r\n\"What did you want to see me about?\" pressed Eve, a little annoyed \"I had to interrupt a date for this.\"<br>\r\n\"Well Eve, it's quite curious you should ask\" said the secretary, finally standing uncomfortably close to Eve with her large body \"I've been hearing about your super heroic exploits. And of course, when I hear about something like that, it's my duty to learn and file away everything there is to know about you. It's what allows us to adapt and respond. It's what makes us stronger.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood for interviews tonight\" replied Eve definitely.<br>\r\n\"I wasn't asking for one. I've heard every conversation you've had with your mother since the beginning. After a bit of searching and cross referencing, Eve, I know more about you than you know about yourself.\"<br>\r\n\"But... how can that be? I scanned my home for any bugs or listening devices - I've seen every wire in our house.\"<br>\r\n\"Then you should have seen your mother's laptop. Twenty years ago I developed a perfect piece of malware - always evolving, and always adapting. One of my smarter creations, it now infects over ninety percent of computers worldwide, and none of them are any the wiser.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright then. I'll just destroy my mom's computer.\"<br>\r\n\"I have my backups. Not least among them, your cellphone. I could direct every spy satellite in the world to listen in on you every second of every day if I wanted to. Trust me, Eve, that's not a battle you can win, at least with your current powers.\"<br>\r\n\"Why are you telling me this? Do you want me to arrest you for spying on people?\"<br>\r\n\"As if you're not doing the same thing with your super hearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point the conversation quietened down a little again. The breeze picked up a little more, and the air grew chilly. Eve sat down. \"Look, secretary, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n\"Quite frankly, I want to help you\" said the secretary \"I'm not that evil really, nor am I ever a liar. Honest. In fact I want to make you more popular than you've ever been before. Turn you into an international sensation. I want you to become so popular...\"<br>\r\n\"You want to conquer the world? 'Cause I've already put one general away for that.\"<br>\r\n\"No, I want to improve you\" replied the secretary \"You're already pretty great, but you're not yet perfect like you should be. I can help you with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this the secretary reached into her back pocket and pulled out a small white pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this pill, you <i>can</i> be immune to xenotime\" continued the secretary \"This pill allows you to overcome all your own limitations. And the best part? I'll let you have it for free. Consider it a tribute to the future goddess of the universe. Of course, Eve, I already know you'll decline and throw this pill away. Power isn't what you really want, is it? In fact, you don't even like your superpowers, do you?\"<br>\r\nEve snatched the pill angrily out of the secretary's hands. \"I do too like my superpowers!\" she burst out \"I'll show you!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't\" said the secretary, clearly getting excited \"You hate them - remember all the fun you used to have when you were a regular girl? When your life was all about video games and soccer and girl guides? Now you'll never be able to do any of that ever again! That is the price of power - that is the sacrifice you must make for the good of mankind. If you were smart, you would do it. Even now, though, I see you hesitating. I fully know you won't.\"<br>\r\n\"Power doesn't scare me\" replied Eve cockily \"In fact, I enjoy my responsibilities. I'd love more powers if that meant I could help people more!\"<br>\r\nThe secretary smiled and whispered to Eve snakily. \"Go on then. Let that desire for power grow inside of you if you really want to embrace it. Let it out! I know you have it in you, even if you deny yourself your destiny. Isn't that why you were BRED, Eve? To create a being of perfect and ultimate power - and here you are, chickening out at the mere thought of it. What a disappointment you are. A superhero with so little courage and so little power. I knew I wouldn't be up against much of a challenge when I execute my little scheme.\"<br>\r\n\"You're wrong!\" said Eve \"You made a big mistake giving me this! When I get my power, I shall ensure every wrong-doer is put to justice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Eve put the pill up to her mouth. For several tense seconds she just stood there, jaw open. Then, however, her rage seemed to go away and her head cooled down again. \"I see what you're trying to do\" she said at last \"You're trying to corrupt me with power, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n\"You're only convincing yourself\" retorted the secretary \"Every day when you practice your powers, you do that to improve yourself - not for the good of humanity, but for you. I've dealt with heroes and villains for a long time, Eve. I know your type. Openly you're humble enough, but deep inside, you only care about your powers now. Slowly your powers are already making you forget how much you enjoyed living a normal, stress-free life as a normal, carefree girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve sighed, and handed back the pill. \"I'll get my powers when I'm ready, so I don't need your little pill. I'm sorry. I work alone and don't need candy from any strangers, alright? And besides, I don't really trust you.\"<br>\r\nThe secretary smiled, took the pill and ate it. \"It's alright, it was indeed just a bit of candy anyway. Tastes delicious but wouldn't have otherwise affected your powers.\"<br>\r\nEve was stunned for a moment. \"Why... why did you do that?\"<br>\r\n\"I am the secretary. I learn things and catalog everything. I don't destroy anything myself, though if I need to I can manipulate people into destroying themselves. That's my little superpower. I was just conducting a little psychological experiment to understand you better. When my master plan goes into action, Eve, I want you alive, because you're going to be a part of it whether you like it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the two stared each other down. Finally Eve asked \"What master plan?\"<br>\r\n\"You can choose to work with me, Eve, but you cannot work against me. If you want to contact me, I'm sure you'll see me around.\"<br>\r\nEve frowned, again annoyed. \"Don't you dare waste my time\" she warned, her temper again flaring \"Tell me your master plan.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I do like it when you get angry\" chuckled the secretary, turning the boat engine on again \"You're so cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly flames began flickering lightly from Eve's skin, and her muscles bulged out a little. Internally Eve was becoming increasingly annoyed and angry. \"Tell me before I make a force field in your throat.\" she said darkly.<br>\r\n\"That's it, Eve\" called the secretary over the loud sound of the engine as the boat began moving through the water \"Deep inside, Eve, I know there's evil in you yet. Let it out on me! Force me to tell you everything!\"<br>\r\nBy now a raging inferno was surrounding Eve, as she felt herself grow slightly and her muscles bulge out further. Just as her rage threatened to control her entire mind and body, however, Eve stopped herself as she realized the secretary's boat was on fire. Getting a grip on herself with a giant mental effort, Eve's body returned to normal and the flames surrounding her disappeared. \"I'm sorry!\" said Eve quickly, blowing out the fire with her ice breath \"I didn't mean to do that!\"<br>\r\n\"Go to bed little girl\" grinned the secretary \"You look like you're getting tired from all that raging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve sighed. The secretary was right. She was getting tired.<br>\r\n\"I'll be watching you\" said Eve at last.<br>\r\n\"Goodbye\" said the secretary neutrally as Eve teleported back to her room and shut her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her eyes shut, she thought she saw the general walking the streets as a free man. Too tired to investigate, though, she rapidly fell into a deep sleep, hovering mid-air above her bed, with the assumption that he was on bail or the like.</span></div></div>",

A pair of fiery red lasers shot out of her eyes and narrowly missed her mother, who was trying to shake Eve's levitating arm awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve! What the heck!?\" growled her mother angrily as two large holes burnt into the wall behind her while Eve got her laser vision under control.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry mom!\" replied Eve in shock and fear, flying back a bit \"I didn't know I could do that! Honest!\"<br>\r\nHer mother looked at Eve sternly. \"You're a superhero. It's your duty not to use powers that you can't yet control, understand? Even accidentally.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes Mom\" said Eve, breathing heavily with relief that her mother was alright \"You scared me.\"<br>\r\n\"Then maybe you need to practice not using your powers. That way you won't be so tempted to use them when I try to wake you up in the morning.\"<br>\r\n\"But Mom!\" objected Eve.<br>\r\n\"No buts about it. I want you to stop using your powers for as long as you can, starting right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve sighed heavily, before slowly levitating down to the ground.<br>\r\n\"Now no matter how many monsters are destroying the city or how many people are being killed all around you, I want you to try to control yourself and not use your powers. Understood?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes Mom\" sulked Eve.<br>\r\nAt this, her mother bent down a little and hugged Eve. \"Don't worry, sweetheart. I don't like doing this to you, but I'm really afraid you might hurt somebody, especially now that you're more powerful than you know. I know it'll be hard, as your instinct is to use your powers all the time, but please try to fight it for a little while. Super patience is a super power too, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n\"I get it Mom\" replied Eve \"I'm really, really sorry that I almost killed you. So... um... what did you want to wake me up so suddenly for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother stood up again, sighing. \"We had a break in last night. A couple of things got stolen here and there. Our TV, my computer, my jewellery...\"<br>\r\nEve was stunned. \"What!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"The thieves took off with a lot of valuables but they left the Zenotime behind. I suppose they didn't know about its effect on you, so you're safe. Whatever happened to your super not needing sleep power?\"<br>\r\nEve deadpanned. \"That was a joke, mom. But this is serious! We have to catch them! What was the model number of our TV? I'll use my super vision to...\"<br>\r\n\"No you won't\" interrupted her mom \"This one we'll leave to the authorities, sweetie. You need to practice not using your powers. If you keep away from using your powers all day, then tonight maybe I'll let you practice being the night watch lady of the city. Then maybe your body can learn not to need sleep.\"<br>\r\n\"A full day!\" exclaimed Eve \"But Mom - I feel like I really need to breathe fire, or teleport somewhere, or turn invisible! What about practicing my laser vision!?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry Eve\" laughed her mother, kissing her cheek lightly \"But being a superheroine isn't just about developing your powers. It's also about learning when not to use your powers.\"<br>\r\nEve groaned as she walked off towards the bathroom, annoyed at how slow each step seemed when she wasn't using her super speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve stepped on to the school bus sadly. Since she wasn't allowed to be a hero, she'd changed back into some of her normal clothes for school.<br>\r\n\"Finally realized your outfit sucks, dork?\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up Percy, I'm not in the mood for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Eve, what's going on?\" asked Jessica as Eve sat down \"What happened to your awesome costume?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't really want to talk about it\" said Eve, slumping back in her seat.<br>\r\n\"Did you lose it battling a super villain or something?\" asked Sophie \"Was it really embarrassing?\"<br>\r\nEve chuckled a little. \"Nothing quite that bad. I would definitely talk to you two about it if there weren't so many other people here.\"<br>\r\n\"Why not use your super speed to take us somewhere private where we can talk, then?\" asked Sophie.<br>\r\nEve didn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Emma, who happened to be sitting in the seat opposite the trio of friends, leaned over. \"Eve, can you show me how you do that flying thing again? Might just give me some inspiration as I work out our routine...\"<br>\r\n\"Emma, I still haven't decided to join cheerleading\" replied Eve.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about the suit!\" continued Emma, not really listening \"I'll make some calls - we can get you into a totally sexy outfit that'll blow...\"<br>\r\nEve felt her frustration grow, as though letting out her annoyance at not being able to use her powers. \"I don't want to be a cheerleader!\" she shouted loudly and defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stunned silence filled the bus, as all eyes fell on Eve.<br>\r\nEventually Ryan stood up. \"Eve, I know soccer's always been your thing, I'm really sorry\" he said \"Emma just suggested to me that you try it tonight when we have our big game. We could really use your support - if we win this we go through to the regional semifinals. So - I mean - please don't take it personally, alright? Heck, I wanted to let you play, coach just wouldn't have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve sighed. \"Sorry for shouting at you Emma\" she said at last \"I'm just a bit stressed this morning. I'll be there to support the team, Ryan. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it\" interrupted Percy, standing up with a wicked smile and still wearing the neck brace, which he'd painted midnight black with red skulls \"Little Eve is too embarrassed. You're just a little crybaby with superpowers!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, shut up\" said Ryan nervously \"Eve's my friend.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that right?\" asked Percy, walking over \"Well I'm your master. This is my school! Eve may be the hero of the day, but I'm still the king in the end! So choose your next words wisely, if you don't want to get crippled before your big match!\"<br>\r\nRyan backed down in the face of the intimidating stare of Percy. \"I... I'm sorry...\" he whispered \"Don't hurt me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Eve!\" called over Percy \"That's what real respect looks like! In fact since Ryan respects me so much, he's going to voluntarily give me all his lunch money, right now! Aren't you, Ryan?\"<br>\r\nRyan looked at Percy in horror, before giggling nervously. \"I... I didn't bring any lunch money. Must have forgotten it at home, silly me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Ryan knew, Percy punched his face so hard that it caused his whole body to shake, jiggling several coins in his pocket.<br>\r\n\"See Eve, this is how it's done!\" explained Percy as he reached into Ryan's pockets. Ryan looked as though he'd been knocked out cold. \"This is how you do it Eve! Even my punches make losers like Ryan richer. Don't you worry about him - I'm just giving him what he deserves! You should try it! Don't mess around with all that crap about being good or your lame costume! Being a bully is SO much better. Best decision I ever made! Come on, don't be a wuss! Lash out at people! Maybe then you won't be so much of a freak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve covered her face in her hands, trying really hard to control herself and not use her laser vision to rip Percy to shreds right then and there. \"Do something!\" whispered Jessica to her.<br>\r\n\"I can't\" whispered Eve back \"I'm not allowed to use my powers until tonight. My mom said so.\"<br>\r\n\"But this guy needs your help!\" whispered Sophie, joining the huddle \"You're not going to just leave your captain behind are you?\"<br>\r\n\"I told you\" replied Eve \"I can't! I really want to, and I feel really angry, but I'm holding myself back as best I can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn total frustration, Jessica clapped her hands and stood up. \"I'm not taking it anymore\" she said \"Give back his money\"<br>\r\n\"You want a piece of me too?\" screamed Percy, flailing his fists. Eve looked up at Jessica, confused. \"Don't do it\" whispered Eve.<br>\r\n\"Me too\" chimed in Sophie \"I'm not taking it anymore. Give back his money.\"<br>\r\n\"Give it back\" added Emma, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, each student in the bus (with the exception of Percy's small gang of goons) stood up, saying the same thing. Eve and Percy were, for once, united - both staring around the bus unsure of what was going on or how to react. For a moment, looking around, he was totally stunned and looked a little defeated, almost as though he was seriously contemplating giving the money back. Just then, however, the bus driver tooted his horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you kids all sit down!\" he called from the front of the bus.<br>\r\nPercy snarled. \"Sure, no problem driver\" he said as he took Ryan's money back to his seat. Ryan was just starting to stir again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" whispered Jessica to Eve as the bus calmed down and took their seats \"Sometimes you don't even need your powers to be a hero. Sometimes all it takes is a bit of courage. That's what my grandma always used to say anyway.\"<br>\r\n\"Jess, that was amazing!\" replied Eve, still stunned \"Your grandma must be really wise.\"<br>\r\nJessica laughed playfully. \"Hey, you're the one with super intelligence here! I guess your super wisdom will come soon too.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but Percy's still got Ryan's money\" pointed out Sophie.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure our favorite superhero can... ahem... *deal* with that later\" replied Jessica, before bursting out laughing.<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe I can't use my powers for a day. It really sucks\" said Eve \"I... I feel like I'm just about to burst or something. Like I'm not using all this power and it's all inside me, struggling to get out.\"<br>\r\nSophie laughed. \"Just make sure you don't accidentally let it all out on me!\"<br>\r\nEve groaned, forgiving her friend for reminding her of her near-homicide experience that morning.<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, two more days of school\" said Jessica as the bus stopped outside the school \"Time to have some fun! Best friend hug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Eve left the bus, feeling more normal than she had in a long few days.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luca had just started middle school, but didn't seem to be running out of cute points - his handsome young face, with sweet hazel eyes and dirty blonde hair, made it difficult for him to blend into a crowd, even though he was only of average height. His father, Ben, was the sort of man who didn't like to draw too much attention to himself. He was retired, had a small apartment on the outskirts of the city, and spent a lot of time playing video games. Luca wasn't sure exactly what his father had done for a living, or why he didn't seem to look much like him - he loved him all the same. Most of the time Ben allowed Luca to hang out anywhere around the city where they lived, so Luca could spend a large amount of time just hanging out with his friends. As for his mother, all Luca knew was that she was gone. Ben never wanted to talk about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school, Luca was quite popular, but always busy. He was captain of the swim team, soccer team, and the chess team. When he wasn't occupied with one of the many clubs he was involved with, Luca was doing extra homework or reading advanced books. He did have some enemies around the school though - and of those enemies, the biggest one was Macie. Macie was a tall brunette girl who was obviously a future supermodel. She loved inventing things, and her inventions were always brilliant. The only problem was, Luca was always getting better grades than her. It made her jealous to no end. What was worse, Luca seemed to be the only boy in the school who didn't always do things her way just because she was pretty. Every night she dreamed that one day, she could build a giant killer robot and destroy Luca once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis particular autumn day had been a really long one for Luca. After a busy day at school, he had just enough time for a quick game of soccer at the park before catching up with one of his buddies from the swim team, Caleb, who was celebrating his birthday at the pools. After partying with Caleb and his friends into the night, Caleb's mum dropped Luca off outside his father's apartment. Somewhat tired, Luca took out his key and opened the apartment door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, I'm home!\" Luca called out above the distant video-game sounds.<br>\r\nThe game sounds stopped and Ben poked his head around the corner. \"Did you have fun at the party?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes dad\" yawned Luca.<br>\r\nBen smiled. \"Looks like it's time for you to head for bed\" he said.<br>\r\n\"Good night, Dad\"<br>\r\n\"Night, Luca\"<br>\r\nAnd with that, Ben went back to playing his video game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca streched his arms and wandered sleepily over to the bathroom. As he lazily brushed his perfect white teeth, Luca already felt like he was half-asleep. He began imagining what it would be like to fly - to be able to soar up through the air and effortlessly glide around the world. Almost subconsciously, Luca stood up on his tippy-toes, one arm brushing his teeth, the other outstretched. He closed his eyes and imagined the cold air rushing past his earlobes, his clothes brushing in the wind against his skin, and his eyes seeing the most amazing sight - the whole city, from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Luca opened his eyes to spit and rinse his mouth. It was only after he did so that he noticed something very peculiar - he couldn't feel the floor under his feet anymore! Startled, Luca let out a quiet gasp as he looked down. It was hard to see from his angle, but it did indeed look like he was floating a few centimeters in the air! Luca barely supressed a shriek as he began to wonder how he was going to get down again, and then suddenly dropped the short distance to the ground with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca's heart beat heavily. For a moment he thought perhaps his father had heard the noise, but luckily the sound of the video game must have drowned it out. He looked at himself in the mirror again. Did ... did he just levitate? For all that he had been tired mere seconds ago, now the young preteen was wide awake and wondering what was going on. Levitation? That was impossible. In fact, Luca could quote verbatim all the scientific theories that proved it. It couldn't be true ... or could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hurry, Luca walked briskly to his room and shut the door behind him. He pulled out of his chest of drawers a stack of old comics that he had picked up at a book fair years ago. His eyes gleaming, he flicked through pages and pages of pictures of superheroes, defeating bad guys across the galaxy. Was he crazy? Had he just been tired? These questions did cross his mind, but in that moment, he was too excited to care. What if he really had floated? Perhaps he could be Luca, protector of Earth and savior of mankind? He began to wonder if he had any other powers as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe excitement waning a little, Luca thought to try his powers again. He drew the curtain on his window in case anyone was watching, and wished to fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little frustrated, Luca sighed, but he tried again. This time, he tried it a bit more calmly, as he had been in the bathroom. Cross-legged he sat down on his bed as if to meditate, imagining himself flying. This time, slowly ... ever so slowly ... the boy felt the bedding move away from his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" he whispered to himself as he began to rise gently off the covers. He kept going until he was no longer touching the fabric with his legs. As a test, he reached down and put his hand between himself and the bed, to make sure he was really levitating. Then, equally slowly, the boy imagined himself landing, and began to float down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to learn to control this power\" he said to himself quietly while landing \"This is so cool! I'm like a real-life superhero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, by that time the young boy had begun to feel tired again. Whatever powers he had, he reasoned, he could explore them the next day. With another yawn, he changed into his nightwear, turned off the light, and quickly dozed off to sleep, as the sound of video games clanged in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on a faraway planet, a pretty alien girl with sweet hazel eyes and dirty blonde hair was being interrogated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know you've had a child with a protected species\" growled the interrogator \"And you know the penalty for such horrific acts. Tell us where you are hiding this child, or we will be forced to push for the maximum punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have to tell you anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is your choice. Tell us, or we will have to kill both you and your baby. And believe me, we have ways of making this extremely painful for both of you. At least tell us which planet you had this child on ... and you will both be spared the death penalty, albeit left to rot in prison. Perhaps your child might get parole one day. After all it's not fair on them, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm innocent. That's all I have to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lying won't do you or your child any favors. We will find them. Our scouts left our planet this morning, travelling through wormholes to every corner of the galaxy. When they find the planet and locate your child, their orders are to blow the whole place up on sight without warning. Now granted, scanning millions of planets could take months ... or, if you're unlucky, perhaps they are just minutes away from destroying your beloved child. Clock is ticking - when you are ready to tell us where your child is, just let me know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the interrogator left the room as the alien girl began to cry.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luca woke up the next day feeling fresh. He began to go through his morning routine, first heading to the bathroom to take a quick shower. After cleaning himself, he took a moment to style his hair and admire how good he looked. Then he went back to his bedroom, put on a clean set of his school uniform, and tossed his dirty clothing from the day before into the laundry. Next, Luca crept past the lounge where his father was still asleep, into the kitchen to make himself two sandwiches for breakfast. After eating those, Luca went back to the bathroom to brush his teeth. Only then did he remember about the strange evening he had the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his eyes, Luca held out his arms and once again floated softly into the air. He breathed heavily in excitement as he watched himself rise gently in the bathroom mirror, before landing again like a feather. \"So awesome\" he whispered to himself, before diligently brushing his already-perfectly-healthy teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was little time for exploring his powers then and there, however, as Luca knew the school bus wouldn't be far away. With some urgency now, Luca packed his school bag, and left the apartment quietly enough to allow his father some quality sleeping time. Thankfully he didn't have to wait long at the bus stop down the street - Luca had something of a sixth sense concerning how far away the bus was from his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst period - writing. Luca knew just what he wanted to write about today - superheroes. Excitedly he jotted down page after page of stories about famous heroes, while at the back of the class, Macie just stared at him enraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond period - physical education. The PE teacher took the students to the hall to practice juggling. Within minutes Luca was happily juggling a large assortment of sharpened knives, while Macie huffed beside him, unable to keep more than three balloons in the air simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, I'm having a bad day\" sighed Macie as she headed out for recess.<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to get you a drink of water?\" asked one of her hangers-on.<br>\r\n\"Yes please - I think I might be sick\" replied Macie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca exited the class after her, surrounded by a mob of admirers. In the distance, Caleb caught his eye. Thanking those around them, Luca rushed over to talk to his swim-team friend.<br>\r\n\"Hey Caleb - you won't believe what happened to me after your party last night!\" said Luca.<br>\r\n\"Did you find $50 on the ground or something?\" asked Caleb.<br>\r\n\"Nope\" smiled Luca \"Much better. Come on, I'll show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca led Caleb around the back of the school to where the rubbish was dumped. \"You know this is out of bounds right?\" whispered Caleb \"We could get in big trouble if we're caught here!\"<br>\r\n\"That's not important right now - I need you to keep this a secret, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"What could possibly be so important? You're always a goody-good.\"<br>\r\n\"Watch this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca closed his eyes, and Caleb couldn't believe his! Right in front of him, Luca was really floating up into the air. Caleb walked around him, crouched down to get a better view, and held his mouth agape in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty cool, huh?\" said Luca softly. He was trying to make himself move forwards to impress his friend, but so far had only mastered a soft up-and-down motion. With some experimentation, he was able to gently \"pull\" himself forward with his arms up. He rolled around and found it quite comfortable to do so lying flat, although it was a bit awkward at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb watched his friend figure out the mechanics of his flying power in awe. \"What ... how are you doing that!?\" he said, only slightly mindful of avoiding making noise.<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" replied Luca honestly, softly lowering himself back to ground level \"It doesn't make any sense to me either\". He had been almost two meters off the ground, barely even realizing how high he had gone.<br>\r\n\"Does this make you kind of like a superhero?\" asked Caleb.<br>\r\n\"I guess so\" shrugged Luca \"It makes me wonder if I have any other powers, and why I have these powers in the first place.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should ask your dad\" replied Caleb \"I mean, it does kind of make sense ... you are good at everything after all.\"<br>\r\nLuca brushed it off \"Come on now ... you're an awesome swimmer.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah and you've got every single school swimming record to your name\" retorted Caleb \"You've gotta admit, that's superhero-esque.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright fine, but ... I still couldn't do it without all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext period - maths. Once again the tension in the room was palpable. Macie rushed through a page of her middle school grade mathematics textbook, glancing up in hopes of having beaten Luca for once. In the time it took her to do just one page, however, Luca had gone though an entire advanced university-level calculus textbook without making a single error on any of the exercises. Macie wanted to scream in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourth period - science. While the other students made simple rockets out of balloons, Macie and Luca (being advanced students) were allowed to work on their own air-powered rocket designs. Macie worked really hard on hers, both to make the design look awesome and to make sure it could fly at a great distance. As she was about to present her cute little rocket to the teacher, she saw Luca had already completed his. Macie launched her rocket out of the sky and was proud that it made it all the way across the school courtyard. \"Beat that!\" she taunted Luca. Shyly, Luca launched his own rocket out the window, which promptly blasted off into the sky and disappeared with a little twinkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, I've had it!\" yelled Macie as she stormed out of the classroom. A few other students rushed after her, asking if she was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the lunchtime break, Luca locked himself into a bathroom cubicle and thought about his schedule. Writing up a brief plan on a sheet of paper, he began adding times for superpower practice. He needed time, he reasoned, to develop and hone his powers before he could be a true superhero ... the awkward flying he had demonstrated to Caleb during interval just wouldn't cut it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing that, Luca had to go to a student council meeting. Macie, he noticed, wasn't there at her usual seat. He hoped she'd be alright. The meeting itself went fairly smoothly ... mostly the teachers just wished to know whether students liked the design of a proposed new playground, and everyone agreed that they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifth period - reading. Luca headed for the library, found himself some superhero comics, and read them with newfound enthusiasm. He imagined himself in each of the stories, and began to wonder what sort of a moral code he would have as a hero. Would he ever kill a bad guy? Luca thought probably not, but what if it was by accident? He reasoned that he'd really have to learn to control his powers. He couldn't wait to explore whether it was just flying he could do, or other things as well. Across the room, Macie spent the whole period glaring at him through bloodshot, tear-stained eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinal period - music. Here Macie pretended to compose her own music on the computer, but was constantly distracted by Luca improvising some insanely good piano music.<br>\r\n\"Uhm ... if you want us to tell him you like him, you know we're there for you, right?\" asked one of Macie's friends gently.<br>\r\n\"I do NOT like him!\" huffed Macie.<br>\r\n\"Oh ... I just thought since you keep gazing in his direction, maybe...\"<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare get me started\" replied Macie \"I'm the pretty and talented one here, not you and certainly not him. I'd rather die than have to date the likes of him!\"<br>\r\n\"If you say so\" said her friend tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, Macie was one of the first to leave. Immediately she speed-dialed a number on her phone. \"Mother, you won't believe what happened to me in school today!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not wanting to disclose his powers to too many others before he had a chance to talk with his dad, Luca called up Caleb after school. The boys met up in a secluded spot in the local park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I've made a list of every superpower I can think of\" said Luca, handing his friend a long sheet of paper \"Let's see if I'm developing any of them. You check off the powers if you think I might have them. Of course I could always develop more powers later on, but I want to see what I'm already capable of maybe without realizing it.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay\" replied Caleb with a grin \"I think we'd better get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Super hearing!\" read out Caleb, directing Luca to tell him what various people in the park were talking about. With little difficulty, Luca found he was able to distinctly hear any conversation in the whole park that he focused on. \"Check!\" called out Caleb as he ticked it off his list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Super vision!\" ... this time, Caleb directed Luca to look up at a distant airplane and describe all the passengers he saw through the windows. Luca surprised himself with just how well he could do this, almost effortlessly focusing his gaze through each individual window and describing what he could see inside. \"Check!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shapeshifting!\" ... Luca closed his eyes and imagined becoming a dog as hard as he could. \"Is it working?\" he asked. \"Nope\" replied Caleb, crossing it off his list \"I'd say that one's not a check. Let's move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flying!\" ... Luca happily demonstrated his ability again for his friend. It seemed that each time he did it, flying became a little easier ... \"Check\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teleportation\" ... Luca concentrated on disappearing and reappearing behind his friend, but it didn't work ... \"Not check\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Super Healing\" ... Caleb took a needle and tried to prick Luca's skin with in. Try as he might, though, the needle wouldn't pierce the skin. The boys looked at each other in confusion for a long time ... eventually, Luca agreed to allow Caleb to stab his arm with a knife. Again, though, the knife wouldn't go through his skin no matter how hard Caleb pushed on it. Even when Luca stabbing himself as hard as he could, there was no way he could make the knife go into his body. By the end of their experiments, Luca was completely unharmed but the knife was looking somewhat blunted. \"Let's put a question mark next to that one and check off super durability instead\" said Caleb. Luca nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time travel!\" ... Luca tried to go back in time to see when Caleb had woken up that morning. Again, though, nothing happened. \"Not check\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Super intelligence\" ... Caleb took one look at Luca ... \"Check\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Super speed!\" ... Caleb had Luca sprint around the track of the field as fast as he could while he timed. Luca was a blur as he set off, darting around the field at speeds that left bystanders in awe. Luca was just concentrating on running, until he noticed that he was going faster than the cars on the road beside him. He slowed down a little to avoid attracting too much attention before returning to Caleb. \"How fast was I?\" he asked. Caleb just stared at his timer in disbelief ... \"Let's just check that one\" said Luca, who wasn't even remotely tired from his sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Telekinesis!\" ... Caleb asked Luca to make an acorn float with his mind. Luca concentrated really hard, but it wouldn't budge. \"Not ch...\" began Caleb - \"WAIT!\" interrupted Luca \"I could swear I just made it move!\" ... Luca kept concentrating and Caleb saw that the acorn was indeed moving a little from side to side, but it was such a small movement he had hardly noticed. \"I guess I'll put a question mark next to that one\" replied Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intangibility!\" ... Luca jogged against a tree, hoping to pass straight through it. The reaction was as expected, and Luca fell to the ground as the whole tree shook and buckled from the heavy impact. \"Not check\" replied Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Super strength!\" ... the boys made for a creek near the park, where a heavy old log had fallen. With some strain, Luca lifted the log and carried it out of the ankle-deep creek. \"Wow that was heavy\" he said, drying his feet and putting his shoes back on. \"It's heavier than anyone else around here can lift - they were going to get a digger in to pick that up, you know\" replied Caleb \"I'm checking it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Underwater breath!\" ... Luca held his face underwater and, throwing caution to the wind for a moment, let a big gulp of water into his mouth. It felt like he was choking at first, but when he breathed the water out again, it began to feel more natural. After about a minute, air bubbles stopped coming out with his breaths and Caleb came to check on him, but Luca was completely fine breathing underwater! \"No wonder you're so good at swimming ... Check!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind reading!\" ... Caleb picked up playing cards from a deck and asked Luca to read his mind and find out what cards he was seeing. At first this was easy as Luca could see the reflection of the cards from the glint in Caleb's eyes with his super vision, but then Caleb hid the cards behind a bush. Luca concentrated on Caleb's mind as hard as he could ... thinking about what Caleb would be thinking about right now ... and took a bit of a guess. \"King of hearts?\" he asked. \"Yip\" replied Caleb. The boys repeated the experiment a few more times and each time, Luca's \"guesses\" proved right, much to his own surprise. \"Check\" replied Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"X-Ray vision!\" ... This time, Caleb had Luca concentrate on the bush itself, rather than his mind. Luca stared at the bush, trying to see past it ... and shocked himself when the bush started to disappear before his very eyes! He was so startled that he lost his concentration, and the bush reappeared, so he had to try again. It felt like an incredible rush, to know he must have developed some of these powers a while ago but never thought to try them. Each time he did it, it became much easier for him to do as well. Needless to say, he correctly named every card. \"Check!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Invisibility!\" ... Luca closed his eyes and concentrated. A gasp from Caleb let him know it was working! \"Hey Luca, take a look at yourself!\" said Caleb with a chuckle. Luca opened his eyes and couldn't see himself or his clothing at all! \"Woah - this is so cool!\" he said, peering all around where his body should be. Then, ever so slowly, he made himself visible again. \"I think that power is one of my favorites\" he said. \"Check\" replied Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire breathing!\" ... Luca tried to make a small fireball come out of his mouth. He noticed his breath was a bit warmer than usual, but no fireball. \"Not check\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enhanced combat!\" ... Luca stood across from a Karate master at a local dojo. He saw the master lunge at him almost in slow motion - and with superhuman dexterity, Luca ducked out of the way. It was as though he somehow knew exactly where to push the master to make him fall down - in a swift motion, Luca had the black belt squirming on the ground, pinned down by Luca's super-strong foot. \"Check\" said the karate master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enhanced beauty!\" ... The boys went down to a local modelling studio for a tryout. Caleb was quickly rejected, but Luca was immediately offered a large sum of money to model a brand of underwear. As he walked on to the set, the underwear showing off all his best features, the photographers were stunned and offered him a large bonus to entice him to come back again. \"Check\" they all said together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more tests later, the boys were lying on the grass in the park, watching the sunset.<br>\r\n\"That was pretty amazing\" said Caleb \"Already you've got more powers as a kid than just about any superhero. If you keep developing powers and honing the ones you have, you'll be like a god!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so\" replied Luca timidly \"I mean, using my powers is fun and all. But being just a regular kid is pretty nice too.\"<br>\r\n\"You mean, you don't want to have powers? Be a hero? Save the day?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, but I'm thinking of people like Macie. People who try so hard but will never be as good at these things than me. They need to know that they matter, too.\"<br>\r\nCaleb sighed. \"Don't worry about her. She's just jealous, that's all. I'm sure once you get established as a superhero, even she'll come around.\"<br>\r\n\"You think?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure of it. Now - let's go home. I'm sure your dad must be waiting for you.\"<br>\r\nLuca smiled. \"Thanks for helping me out, I appreciate it\" he offered.<br>\r\n\"Anytime, super-buddy\" replied Caleb \"See you tomorrow!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luca opened the door of his father's apartment. \"Dad, I'm home\" he called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of video games in the room next door stopped and once again, Ben poked his head around the corner. \"Good to have you back, son\" he said \"There's some leftover pizza in the fridge if you're hungry.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh - dad? Can I talk to you for a minute?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, son. Come on in, take a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca wandered into the darkened living room. His dad was there, lounging on the couch with a video game controller in his hand. Some kind of first-person shooter was displayed on the large screen. All around the room were scattered random food scraps, beer cans and old bits of packaging. The whole room hadn't been cleaned in years - indeed, such would have been the fate of the rest of the house, had Luca not kept it tidy. Luca sat down gently on a torn lounge chair, wondering why his dad chose to live this way. Briefly he considered reading his mind to find out, but then he remembered his thoughts in school about a moral code. Perhaps he shouldn't use his mental powers too much without permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uhm... last night\" began Luca \"I kind of figured out that I can fly.\"<br>\r\nBen nodded gently. \"And... ?\"<br>\r\n\"And after school I discovered I actually have a ton of other superpowers as well.\"<br>\r\n\"And... ?\"<br>\r\n\"And I think I'm still developing my powers. I'm noticing that the more I use them, the more powerful I become.\"<br>\r\nBen raised an eyebrow \"Okay but I mean, what's your point?\"<br>\r\nLuca eyed his father. \"Doesn't that ... surprise you? I mean, most kids don't exactly have superpowers.\"<br>\r\nBen chuckled. \"Your mother wasn't like most women either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Luca was stunned. \"You ... you never talk about ...\"<br>\r\n\"Well, this would have to be an exception. Have you told anyone about your powers?\"<br>\r\n\"Only yourself and my friend Caleb, why?\"<br>\r\n\"It's best you keep them a secret. Only tell those you really trust. That's one reason I have to stay hidden.\"<br>\r\nLuca's eyes grew wide. \"Do... do you have powers too?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no, nothing like that. But if they find me, they can find you too. Your mother entrusted me with your care, since I can be better hidden than she can.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait wait wait ... who are 'they'?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know for sure. That's the only word she ever used for them. But they are dangerous and they will stop at nothing to destroy us all if they find you. Even their motives, I don't know. Your mother had many secrets, and I knew from the moment I first saw you, you're bound to have many secrets inside you too. Your mother warned me that even she could not predict what you'd grow up to be, whether it would be good or bad for the world. But in my heart I always knew you'd grow up to be a good person. I knew that if there was a single gene from me in your body, it would be my heart.\"<br>\r\n\"So I'm like the son of Supergirl or something? Wonder Woman?\"<br>\r\n\"Kind of\" replied Ben with another chuckle \"She's not a character you'd know. She didn't really have any 'powers' in the conventional sense either, so far as I know. But she certainly wasn't human. The only person who I can say looks even remotely like her, is you. You remind me of her every single day. It's hard. I miss her so much. But I know it's for the best.\"<br>\r\nLuca blushed. \"Where did she go?\" he asked.<br>\r\nBen paused. \"I think that's all you need to know for now\" he said slowly \"I'll fill you in on the rest when the time is right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca went over to the kitchen, took a cold slice of pizza out of the fridge, and put it in the microwave. As he watched the pizza slice spin around, he replayed his brief conversation with his dad over in his mind. Who was he? What was he? If his mother was not a human, what was she? Who was hunting him, and why? He didn't mind keeping a secret identity - actually he quite liked the idea - but he still wanted to know more. Again the temptation was there to just read Ben's mind and find the answers, but again he stopped himself. He couldn't do that, especially not to his own father. What did this mean for him and his powers? He certainly still wanted to use his powers, but if it put the world in danger... ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe timer on the microwave beeping interrupted his thoughts. Luca took the hot pizza out of the microwave and munched on it slowly. After finishing his light dinner, Luca went back into his bedroom and closed the door. Perhaps he was worrying too much, he thought. After all, he could scarcely help the fact he was handsome, and hadn't even told his father how he had earned hundreds of thousands of dollars just by posing for a camera a few hours ago. Perhaps he just had to learn to accept his destiny, and be brave despite the challenges. Whoever 'they' were, he somehow knew he could take them if he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboldened with his newfound confidence, Luca practiced again and again, drifting up and down into the air, and moving back and forth. He was starting to be able to control his flight a lot more, and could move at close to walking pace. Flying felt relaxing and exciting all at once - all he had dreamed of the day before. After a few hours of practice, Luca got himself ready for bed and drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust beyond the solar system, a small alien spaceship flew through a wormhole into vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any of these planets habitable?\" asked the ship commander, feeling bored.<br>\r\n\"Our scanner shows that there's a protected species on one of the rocky inner planets, sire\" reported the navigator \"I believe it's called Earth by the local creatures.\"<br>\r\n\"What a silly name\" mused the commander \"Alright, I suppose we'd better fly in to take a look.\"<br>\r\nThe flying-saucer-shaped ship put on its cloaking shield, protecting it from being seen by any prying astronomers, and zoomed in towards the earth at speeds much faster than light itself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Period one - art. \"Perfect,\" thought Luca, as he sketched out a superhero costume for himself. Making himself unrecognisable was a particular challenge, so he considered a few options to disguise his more recognisable features - a helmet, a balaclava, thick sunglasses, a mask, and many more options crossed his mind. Eventually, he settled on wearing dark blue spandex with a diamond pattern over it, together with blue-tinted goggles and a set of white boots. On his chest, Luca first considered drawing a big red \"S,\" but thought better of it - he wanted to be his own hero, not a superboy rip-off. So instead he drew a red diamond, adopting that as his symbol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeriod two - reading. Luca took his picture with him and refined it further, based on what he saw in comic books around the library. He added black trims to the spandex and a black set of briefs. He also added a white cape that came down to his ankles, and some black face-paint to further disguise his appearance. Finally, he added his red diamond symbol to his boots and the back of his cape. He figured that if he was going to be a hero, he might as well have some brand recognition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterval came quickly as Luca was having lots of fun designing his costume. However, he had another idea as well.<br>\r\n\"What do you want, freak?\" asked Macie angrily as Luca approached her.<br>\r\nThe girls around her rushed up to Luca, trying to show him a picture on their phones - it was him at the modelling shoot the day before. Already it seemed the pictures were going viral around the internet, and the company was making millions of dollars. The girls started chattering about how good he looked.<br>\r\nLuca tried to smile. \"Uhm, Macie? Can I talk to you privately?\"<br>\r\nAll the girls around gasped excitedly, their imaginations running wild.<br>\r\nMacie gave in. \"Okay, but make it quick. I'm already late to cheerleading practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca took Macie to an empty classroom, using his x-ray vision to ensure nobody was around.<br>\r\n\"This better be good\" said Macie.<br>\r\n\"Listen, I know you don't like me, but I need your help\" said Luca.<br>\r\n\"Forget it\" replied Macie instantly.<br>\r\n\"No, hear me out\" replied Luca \"See, watch...\"<br>\r\nLuca floated up into the air. \"What the heck?\" said Macie loudly as she watched Luca's feet leave the floor.<br>\r\n\"I've got these superpowers\" explained Luca \"I only found out about them two days ago, I swear. I'm sorry for upstaging you all these years - I never meant to grandstand or anything. You're by far the best student at the school at everything - I don't really belong here.\"<br>\r\n\"Figures\" replied Macie simply, sitting down on a chair and looking sad.<br>\r\n\"I want you to be my manager\" explained Luca \"I need somebody to make a costume for me, help me to train my powers, support me in fighting crime. I got a lot of money from a photoshoot yesterday, so you can have all the resources you need. Together we can fight crime and help people all over the city.\"<br>\r\nMacie's first instinct was to refuse - she didn't care about crime. All she cared about was destroying Luca once and for all. But this did present an opportunity for her - after all, she had heard the saying \"keep your friends close but your enemies closer.\" Perhaps by joining forces, she could find out about Luca's weaknesses and exploit them.<br>\r\n\"Alright\" said Macie \"I'll do it. But how will I explain this to the girls?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think I have the perfect alibi for us to hang out together privately...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah, Macie is my girlfriend now\" said Luca with a smile while Macie went off to cheerleading practice.<br>\r\n\"Yip... it's true\" replied Macie reluctantly, feeling humiliated.<br>\r\nAll of Macie's friends cheered for her. \"Oh my gosh, you're so lucky!\" they said, followed by various comments about how cute he was.<br>\r\n\"So Macie, can I stay over at your place tonight?\" asked Luca very publicly.<br>\r\n\"Sure, lover\" replied Macie spitefully.<br>\r\n\"And your friends won't disturb us, will they?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not\" they all said together, although one of them whispered to Macie afterwards \"Do tell us all about it afterwards, ok?\"<br>\r\n\"No problem\" said Macie, unaware that Luca's super-hearing could understand the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following classes went by relatively quickly. At lunch, Luca went to the school pool for swim team practice.<br>\r\n\"How'd it go with your dad?\" asked Caleb in the changing room.<br>\r\n\"More questions than answers\" replied Luca \"He said my mother wasn't human and that 'they' are out to get us.\"<br>\r\n\"He sounds like he's been playing too many video games\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but two days ago the idea of me being a superhero would have been crazy too\"<br>\r\n\"Not to me. I'd have picked you for the 'most likely to grow up to be a superhero' trophy if there was one.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, if one day you started figuring out you could fly, I bet you'd think it was weird.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever you are\" said Caleb, teasingly punching Luca in the arm \"I sure am glad you're loyal to your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter swimming practice was over, one of the girls from the team - a short brunette girl called Haley - came over to talk to Luca before he got changed.<br>\r\n\"Hey\" she called out \"What's the deal with you and Macie?\"<br>\r\n\"She's my girlfriend\" replied Luca shiftily.<br>\r\n\"Come on, I know that's a lie\" replied Haley \"I know you're not the kind of boy who'd date a girl just for her looks or her brains. I always figured you'd be more into sweet charming girls who stay out of trouble.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry to let you down I guess\" replied Luca \"I'll do my best to keep Macie out of trouble.\"<br>\r\n\"Well if you ever get tired of doing that and want somebody who will actually take care of you and love you forever ...\" said Haley, trying her best to look cute \"You have my number right?\"<br>\r\n\"I'll keep you in mind\" said Luca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the changing rooms, Luca sighed. He definitely wasn't even ready for a relationship full stop, and he knew Haley sure as heck wasn't either. She was always a quiet, diligent girl - the daughter of a local winemaker, raised on religious values. But a relationship was just too convenient an alibi. Besides, he knew Macie wouldn't get any ideas ... he wondered how long he could maintain the relationship? What if later on Macie found somebody who she actually loved, or what if he decided he'd want to be with somebody more like him, such as Haley?<br>\r\n\"Dude, if you're thinking about Macie and stuff, don't worry about it\" said Caleb reassuringly \"I know exactly what you're doing and I think it will be fine.\"<br>\r\n\"I just hope I don't break too many hearts\" said Luca \"I hate hurting people ... especially girls like Haley.\"<br>\r\n\"Adults always say they need to learn to cope with it anyway, so what's the big deal?\" replied Caleb \"Just go with the flow. Things will turn out fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch finished, Luca made a point of always sitting next to Macie in class. Macie cringed every time, but thankfully it wasn't hard to pretend to be interested in a boy universally acknowledged to be the most attractive in the school. She considered asking him for the answers on a maths test, but thought better of it, still caught up in trying to beat him despite his superhuman intelligence. Every time she was frustrated, she wanted to cry out again, but instead just smiled and pretended to be happy for her new boyfriend's constant success.</span></div></div>",

With his super-vision he zoomed in on some random circuit board he saw lying around and admired Macie's attention to detail. \"This stuff is pretty cool\" he said.<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" replied Macie, not even looking at him \"Let's just get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMacie had Luca strip down to his underwear and lie down in a converted sunbed. A laser scanned all around his body and took precise measurements, which were uploaded to Macie's computer. Macie scanned Luca's drawing and applied it to the 3D scan of Luca's body, allowing the two preteens to see a precise 3D visualization of the costume before it was created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks good\" smiled Luca.<br>\r\n\"Let's make it happen\" said Macie, pushing a big red button on the screen with her mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately a converted commercial copier beside her computer sprang into action, drawing out lines of fabric and cutting them into precise strips. Macie fired up an old sewing machine and carefully stitched each piece together, occasionally finding other materials from various drawers around her room. As she finished stitching each piece, she applied a small amount of solvent to the stitches, to help protect them. Macie did this with the speed of a seasoned expert while Luca waited patiently, not that he had to wait very long. Meanwhile, the computer completed simulations on the suit to ensure it would stay together even under \"super\" conditions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last the suit was finished exactly as Luca had envisioned it. Macie put a special spray all over the suit to further protect it and make the suit itself bulletproof. Then, at last, Luca tried it on and looked at himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now THIS - is a superhero!\" cheered Luca.<br>\r\n\"I still think you look too recognisable in it\" replied Macie \"I don't know many eleven-year-olds with abs like yours, sorry.\"<br>\r\nLuca frowned \"Well, it's basic protection anyway. Maybe I should disguise my voice too, just to be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca turned himself invisible - much to Macie's astonishment - and flew outside. At first it was a little unsettling, leaving the window in that way, as Luca was disused to it, but soon he flew upwards into the sky. Still his movements were slow and a little awkward, but he was really starting to get the hang of it - a vast improvement from the clumsy floating he was doing a few days before. He could now move as fast as an average person's running pace, though his own ground speed remained much faster. After some time getting used to wearing the suit, he flew back into Macie's room and turned himself visible again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does the suit fit well?\" asked Macie.<br>\r\n\"Sure does\" replied Luca \"See, this is why I needed your help. If I'd tried to do this, it would have taken much longer.\"<br>\r\n\"Great\" replied Macie \"Now since we're pretending you're my boyfriend, I'm going to need you to do something for me in return. And don't even think about breaking up, or your whole superhero secret will be exposed to the world.\"<br>\r\nLuca gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\" continued Macie, idly brushing her hair \"All you have to do is forfeit all your trophies and awards at school because you cheated. And I mean, isn't that pretty much the truth? Superhuman advantages count as cheating, don't they? And while you're at it, remind the principal who has been coming in second place year after year. Apologize in front of the whole school for being a liar and a cheater and tell them I'm really the best at everything in the school, not you! And finally, demand from him that the school give all due compensation to me for all the emotional distress I've had to suffer because I was undeservedly robbed of all my trophies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca nodded. \"You sure that wouldn't just attract more attention?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't care\" replied Macie \"I deserve to be the queen of this school, and if you're my boyfriend I expect you to treat me as such.\"<br>\r\nLuca was unsure about this attitude, and guessed he'd try to figure the situation out.<br>\r\n\"I'll see what I can do\" replied Luca, his voice betraying his concern.<br>\r\n\"And hey, look on the bright side\" continued Macie \"Maybe if you do exactly what I say I'll let you kiss me and help you out with more of your superhero stuff. Now get out of my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had Luca left the house, than Macie had begun carefully swatting the converted sunbed, taking tiny samples of Luca's sweat and putting them carefully into containers marked \"Superhero DNA.\" \"Now,\" Macie chuckled evilly to herself, \"Now comes the really diabolical part of my plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Luca wasn't listening at the time. Instead, he headed directly for the corner store, now dressed in his school uniform again - he needed some candy to cheer himself up. Macie sure was driving a hard bargain but he did have to admit she had a point - Luca wasn't human, so that made it something of an unfair competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the store, there was a young boy at the counter. \"Sorry but this isn't enough\" said the elderly cashier \"You're almost five dollars short to pay for this candy.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll cover it\" said Luca happily, handing over the money.<br>\r\nThe cashier smiled. \"Thank you\" said the young boy joyously, racing out of the store with his candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca moved to one of the aisles while the cashier put the money away in the till. Soon afterwards, however, a teenage boy entered and pulled a knife from out of his back pocket. \"Hand over the money in the till!\" demanded the teenage boy.<br>\r\nIn shock, the cashier almost fell back and stammered somewhat. \"Hurry up!\" yelled the boy, directly holding the knife against the cashier's throat. Shaking in fear, the cashier began stacking wads of cash into the teenager's backpack.<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" said the teenager when the till was empty, running off outside.<br>\r\n\"You ok?\" the cashier asked in the direction of where Luca had been standing - but then, suddenly, he realised Luca wasn't there. Adjusting his glasses he wondered where the cute, friendly young boy had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the teenage boy met up with a lookout who had been waiting outside the store. \"Let's get out of here!\" they said to each other as they took off down the street. Turning a corner, however, they were surprised to see a young boy with a spandex costume on, floating in mid-air directly ahead of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt!\" called out Luca in an attempt to sound tough.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked one of the teenagers.<br>\r\n\"I'm the Red Diamond\"<br>\r\n\"So, you think you're some kind of superhero 'cause you've mastered some kind of levitation trick? Get out of our way before we stab you with this knife!\"<br>\r\nImmediately, Luca lifted both boys up by the collars of their shirts with ease and flew upwards. \"You guys want to try that again?\" asked Luca.<br>\r\n\"Argh! Help!\" yelled the boys as they tried kicking, punching and stabbing the superpowered preteen to no effect.<br>\r\n\"From now on, this city is under my protection, and I don't tolerate any theft, got it?\"<br>\r\n\"Alright! I won't do it again, I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca let the boys down as the police arrived. Immediately officers were on the scene and apprehended the two criminals, but as soon as they had them, Luca turned invisible and disappeared. The cops were left wondering where the caped flying boy had gone, and the shopkeeper - who had come out to watch the arrest and give the police a statement - was left dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn returning to his shop, the elderly shopkeeper saw Luca inside, having made his selection of sweets.<br>\r\n\"Sorry to keep you waiting\" stammered the shopkeeper \"Just had a bit of a situation happen back there.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" asked Luca innocently.<br>\r\n\"Yes - some thugs tried stealing my hard-earned money. But thankfully a superhero came around and stopped them. Would you believe it? A real superhero!\"<br>\r\n\"You don't say\" smiled Luca, his eyes twinkling.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That evening, Luca hung out around the outskirts of town to practice his powers. The area had some woods and fields of maize, perfect for practicing powers while remaining relatively concealed. Luca had also changed back into his new costume, so he'd grow more used to wearing it while using his powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Luca floated up into the air and practiced flying around. The night air was cool but Luca didn't mind the feeling. He practiced going faster and faster, speeding down towards the Earth faster than gravity would carry him, and suddenly changing direction to fly up towards the sky again. After some time, Luca noticed he was moving so fast, he was leaving a faint blue trail behind him. His cape kept feeling like it was about to come right off, but the whole costume stayed on remarkably well. Macie had done a good job. Luca flew among the trees, darting between them at speed. His agility and speed kept getting better and better while he flew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding again after an intense flying session, but hardly feeling exhausted, Luca caught sight of a pile of giant old logs by the side of the road, likely left there by a logging truck. With a smile, Luca went over and picked up one of the gigantic logs. It was heavily, but Luca could manage it. For fun, Luca tried tossing the log into the air, his super-strong arms tossing the wood like an arrow from a bow, shot into the distance. Concerned about where it might land, Luca raced after the flying log, catching up to it at super speeds and allowing it to drop right into his waiting arms.  Luca played catch with himself a few more times, before putting the log back carefully on the pile. Finally, Luca tried lifting the whole pile of logs. This proved much more difficult, as the logs kept rolling down from each other. Instead, Luca had to content himself with lifting an old tractor he found in the woods, which didn't feel that much more challenging than the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Luca decided to practice his telekinesis. He set a small leaf on the ground and concentrated hard on it. As before, there seemed to be little effect. The leaf fluttered about in the wind, so Luca had to keep putting it down. It was somewhat distracting, and Luca had the feeling that to really hone his telekinesis power, he had to focus. Finding an even more secluded spot, Luca once again was able to cause the leaf to bend a little, but only after a long period of sitting still and concentrating could he be focused enough to lift the leaf off the ground - and then only by a little. Still, Luca took it as a success and moved to on another power to practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Luca ran into a maize field at super speeds. Luca had a lot of fun running faster and faster. His whole form seemed a blur as he moved, and he was enjoying it so much that he barely even registered where he was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Luca reached a clearing. In a split second, Luca could make out a shadow of a grey-bearded man wearing a long brown coat, holding a bright torch in his direction, and an old farm dog beside him.<br>\r\n\"Halt!\" called the man.<br>\r\nLuca was surprised and stunned at being seen. His eyes opening wide, a bright blue laser shot right out of them, blasting the torch into dust. Luca then almost immediately tripped over in his effort to halt quickly, landing hard on the ground and bouncing along painfully. His body rolled uncontrollably at high speed, as though he was in a high-speed head on collision with a truck, blasting dirt right across the clearing. Finally Luca felt himself slowing down, and ending up in a small ditch beside the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man fumbled in his coat for a moment, and picked a pen light from out of his coat pockets. Shining it at the superpowered boy, he asked \"You alright Luca?\"<br>\r\nEven in the darkness beyond the man's pen light, Luca's super vision could see him as clearly as under daylight. Luca was shocked at several things - first, how fast he must have been moving. Second, that apparently his eyes could shoot lasers. And third, that some random stranger could have immediately identified his name.<br>\r\n\"Who ... are you?\" asked Luca, checking that he wasn't injured. Of course, he hadn't sustained any damage at all from the impact, and was able to get up despite feeling a little sore.<br>\r\nThe old man smiled. \"I own this farm.\" he explained \"You'd better come in with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short walk from the clearing was an old run-down farmhouse. It was not long before the man had given Luca a blanket and some hot coca, and the boy was seated snugly by the roaring fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us farmers have known about them aliens for a long time\" explained the man, who had introduced himself as John \"Since the first crop circles began appearing across the world, thousands and thousands of years ago, farmers have looked to the skies to protect our food.\"<br>\r\n\"Why do aliens do that?\"<br>\r\n\"Typically, it isn't intentional. If an alien gets too annoyed, a flying saucer comes down and the farmer is never heard from again. A crop circle is usually just a side-effect of an alien ship coming by for a visit. Indeed, most aliens I've ever met are quite friendly.\"<br>\r\n\"So why don't more people see these aliens?\"<br>\r\n\"Sometimes they do, but of course, they are scared to speak out. In ancient times they were sometimes called gods. Once there was even a battle fought in the earth skies - something like half a millennium ago, over the city of Nuremberg in Germany. Since then, alien visits have been much more infrequent. People are afraid to speak out, because the aliens ensured that soon after their battle, skepticism would come to the fore again. The aliens began the enlightenment and encouraged people to move away from agriculture, into cities, thus cutting down on sightings. At last, the aliens made Earth a protected planet, so visits are less frequent still.\"<br>\r\n\"What are aliens like?\"<br>\r\n\"Most of them are a lot like us, just a little more developed, perhaps. They have fantastic technology and much wisdom. Physically they vary a lot, but they're nothing like you.\"<br>\r\n\"Like me?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. You're a half-breed - the first ever. Neither aliens nor humans have superpowers, but the combination of the two seems to have had some interesting effects.\"<br>\r\n\"How did you know about me?\"<br>\r\n\"Your mother first landed out in the maize field where you had been running. Your father was staying over for a year in the bedroom upstairs. He was just a teenager at the time. Your mother was on the run from alien police. I didn't want her here, but your father thought aliens were cool, and the pair struck up a friendship. And what could I do? You don't try to fight an alien. About nine months later, you were born, and she suddenly disappeared. I baptized you in the river, gave your father some money, and advised him to settle down somewhere quiet. Far as I know, she's still on the run, and as an illegal half-breed, the alien police still want you gone. By staying quiet, hopefully, they are less likely to find you.\"<br>\r\n\"What about my grandparents?\"<br>\r\n\"They know the whole thing too. I think your grandfather died a few years ago. Neither one would recognize you, nor you them. As for your father, well ... after being with an alien, nothing else made him happy again. He tries to find solace in imaginary worlds, and lives for only one thing, the one he loves more than anyone else in the universe.\"<br>\r\n\"My mother?\"<br>\r\n\"What? No, he hates her for leaving him. He lives for you. He cares about you with all his soul. And never mind your physiology - his dedication, his spirit, his care and his courage are superpowers just as strong as yours.\"<br>\r\nLuca took another sip of his coca. \"So this police force, they're the ones who want me?\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, I suppose police is a bad choice of word\" mused John \"Your mother always called them, well, them. She was understandably evasive about it. But the point is this - it is not just you who is in danger. No, for your sake, I believe the punishment on humans in general, and your father in particular, will be much greater. You were born an intergalactic crime.\"<br>\r\nThe words took a moment to sink in for Luca. John smiled.<br>\r\n\"But I am sure you can handle it\" continued John \"Now ... it is getting very late. Your father must be worried about you. I wish you good luck. I am sure we will cross paths again.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" said Luca sincerely.<br>\r\n\"Oh and, before you go, do me a favor ... don't tell your father that we had this conversation. He'd probably get really mad about it.\"<br>\r\n\"I promise I won't\" said Luca, before turning invisible and flying out into the night sky.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luca woke up the next morning feeling as fresh as ever. After slipping into some casual clothes, eating a sandwich for breakfast and brushing his teeth - all while flying around the house to avoid making noise that could wake his father Ben up - Luca left the house as he always did and made for the bus stop with his backpack on. He looked like any ordinary boy around the city, the others on the bus unaware that the polite, friendly child next to them was printed all over the morning newspapers. \"Boy with superpowers saves the day!\" the headline read \"A young child, apparently calling himself the Red Diamond, appears to have developed super powers. Police are grateful to the boy for aiding in the apprehension of two juvenile offenders after an armed robbery yesterday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca read the paper with his super vision from a faraway newspaper stand out of the bus window, and smiled to himself. He was glad to know that he was making a difference around town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the bus dropped Luca off at the sports park, and Luca made for the changing rooms to catch up with his soccer team. He changed into the green and white uniform, and put on his worn out guards and cleats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the referee's whistle blew, Luca rushed into action. Within a few moments of the start of the game he had easily intercepted the ball and kicked it directly into the opposing team's goal.<br>\r\n\"One nil!\" declared the referee, blowing his whistle.<br>\r\n\"Huh? What just happened?\" asked one of the opposing team's strikers.<br>\r\n\"How did he just move so fast?\" asked the other.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Luca's team were jubilant. \"Great shot!\" they all cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the whistle blew to begin the action again, Luca quickly took possession of the ball once more. This time, instead of immediately scoring, he passed it on to one of his teammates. The ball traveled up the wing of the pitch, before Luca's teammate did a poor cross and the ball came back to one of the other team's defenders. The defender was about the pass the ball back to the keeper, before suddenly Luca appeared and scored a goal out of nowhere.<br>\r\n\"Two nil!\" called the referee.<br>\r\n\"How on earth is that kid so good?\" asked some of the supporters on the sideline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three nil!\" yelled the referee as Luca scored again.<br>\r\n\"Four nil!\" ... \"Five nil!\" ... \"Six nil!\" ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about fifteen minutes of being thoroughly thrashed, suddenly Luca heard a police car speeding past with sirens on. Using his super vision, he saw that the police were giving chase to an armed fugitive, who was holding a man hostage in the boot of his car.<br>\r\n\"Sub!\" called out Luca.<br>\r\n\"Ok\" replied the referee, and the other team were happy to see Luca leave the pitch.<br>\r\n\"I'll just be a few moments,\" explained Luca to his team's coach.<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" asked the coach.<br>\r\n\"Just feeling a bit sick is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca rushed down into the changing rooms, a split second later, reappeared as the Red Diamond after changing at super speeds. Invisibly, he flew up into the sky, away from the sports stadium, before appearing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly he spotted the fugitive runaway car below and flew down, leaving a blue and red trail as he bolted as fast as lightning towards the ground.<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! Take that!\" yelled the criminal as he shot the tires of the police car behind him, which promptly stopped. Seeing an officer preparing to lay out spike strips ahead of him, the criminal again laughed. \"Oh no you don't!\" he chuckled as he aimed the barrel of his gun and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\nJust at that moment, a blue-red flash appeared in front of him, and a super powered boy he'd seen on that morning's paper was flying just in front of his car. The bullet bounced harmlessly off the boy's chest. The officer, however, was so startled by this that he totally forgot to deploy his spike strips.<br>\r\n\"Sir, stop your vehicle!\" ordered Luca.<br>\r\n\"Take that!\" replied the criminal in response, shooting at the boy over and over. Each time, however, the bullets glanced right off the preteen's body.<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Luca flew over and effortlessly tore the door right off the man's expensive-looking car. Safely leaving the door at the side of the road, Luca then pulled the gun right out of the man's hands. The man put up his arms in fright. \"Don't shoot me!\" he yelled.<br>\r\nThen Luca noticed the car's steering going out of control while the man had his arms up. The car jolted from side to side as it approached a bridge. Thinking quickly, Luca pulled the man out of the car and put him on the side of the road near the car door. Immediately, several cop cars swarmed at the man, who jumped a fence and tried to run away on foot.<br>\r\nUnder the bridge was a ferry, filled with about a hundred people cruising down the river which ran through the city. Suddenly, those onboard were shocked to see a car fly right off the top of the bridge above them and directly at their ship. The people screamed and ducked down for cover - but the car never fell. Luca held it in mid-air with one arm, stopping the wheels with his other arm. Those on the ship cheered as they watched the boy safely place the car back on the bridge, with almost no damage at all.<br>\r\nMeanwhile the man had run to a bridge and hidden himself inside a small barrel. The police ran past, not having seen where the fugitive had hidden himself. Using his super vision, however, Luca saw the criminal immediately. He flew over, picked up the barrel, and took it over to the officers.<br>\r\n\"He's in here, gentlemen!\" explained Luca with a salute to the officers.<br>\r\nThe fugitive opened up the barrel wide-eyed. \"What!? How!? No! You can't!\" he screamed incoherently. In a fit of range, he tried punching and clawing at Luca while the officers handcuffed him and took him away. Before they could thank Luca, however, Luca had already disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late\" said Luca, coming back to his team at half-time.<br>\r\n\"Well, the score is six goals to us, two to them.\" explained the coach \"Do you think you can go back for the second half?\"<br>\r\n\"You'd better believe it!\" cheered Luca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter winning his soccer game 48 goals to two - a record margin in the history of the club, beating Luca's own previous record - Luca took the bus to the local swimming pool. Here he met up with his friend Caleb.<br>\r\n\"So, last night I was at this weird farmer's place\" explained Luca \"He said I'm the first half-breed, but that my mother was a criminal. He also said that 'they' were a bit like an intergalactic police force. They want to hurt people because of me, since I'm an illegal alien.\"<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound very fair\" said Caleb \"How did he know so much about it?\"<br>\r\n\"He said farmers have known about aliens for a long time\" said Luca \"My mother just so happened to land on his farm.\"<br>\r\n\"That's weird\" replied Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boys went to have fun swimming in the pool, high above the planet, an alien spaceship suddenly appeared, deactivating its cloaking device to scan the planet.<br>\r\n\"Here we go\" said the commander \"It seems like this is the place. The illegal must be down in that part of the planet somewhere. It's time to do battle.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A hatch opened up at the bottom of the alien spaceship. Immediately, hundreds of pod-like drones flew out, dropping down towards the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, we have a situation!\" yelled an operator at a nearby military base \"Hundreds of objects dropping down from outer space like a meteor shower, and they're headed directly for the city!\"<br>\r\n\"Deploy the jets!\" ordered the commander \"We'll have to blast those rocks before they blast us! I can't believe the astronomers never saw this coming...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, fighter pilots scrambled to jump into their planes and take off, as faintly in the distance, hundreds of small lights began appearing in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the pools, Luca and Caleb were enjoying the wave pool. \"This is so much fun!\" called out Caleb \"Hey Luca, after this we should try out the water slide.\"<br>\r\n\"So how'd things go last night with Macie?\" asked a voice behind them.<br>\r\nLuca and Caleb spun around to see Haley swimming there.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Haley\" replied Luca, going a little red \"Things went pretty well I think.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh\" replied Haley, looking quite disappointed.<br>\r\n\"You want to hang out with us?\" asked Caleb \"We're were just about to go to the water slide.\"<br>\r\n\"It's alright\" sighed Haley, looking dejected \"I'll just float down the lazy river\"<br>\r\nWith that, Haley swam off quietly.<br>\r\n\"I see what you meant yesterday\" said Caleb, watching her swim away \"Don't worry, though. She'll be fine.\"<br>\r\nLuca sighed in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Luca noticed on the clock by the pool that it was just on the hour. With his super-hearing, he tuned in to the nearest radio and listened for the news.<br>\r\n\"The military has deployed its jets to help break up what appears to be an incoming meteor storm\" said the newsreader \"Locals are advised to remain indoors as the meteors may come down on the city. While meteor showers are generally harmless, the scale and speed of these objects has surprised many, as astronomers had not made any...\"<br>\r\n\"Uhm, Caleb\" said Luca quietly \"I think I might need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca rushed out of the pool, while making sure to only walk so as not to break the pool's no-running rules. In the changing room, Luca pretended to take a shower, but once inside the cubicle he changed into his costume at super speed, turned invisible and flew outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the swarm of orbs passed through the atmosphere of the planet, they created bolts of light in the sky, making them easy for the pilots of the jet fighters to follow. The lead pilot lined up his scope on one of the orbs.<br>\r\n\"Aim right at the middle boys, fire on my signal! Three ... two ... WHAT THE...?\"<br>\r\nThe lead pilot's signal was cut off as suddenly a powerful laser strike came out of the orb he was aiming towards. The laser hit the plane's wing, causing the plane to spiral out of control. A split second after being hit, the ejection seat fired and the pilot found himself parachuting back towards Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other pilots fired their weapons, but it was to no effect. The strange orbs of light seemed not to take any damage at all while the aircraft were being demolished. As the planes skyrocketed back towards the ground, the fighter pilots found themselves gliding down in their safety equipment. The strange orbs of light flew directly up in front of them.<br>\r\n\"It's all over!\" yelled the lead pilot \"Say your prayers boys! It's been an honor to serve alongside you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb then prepared to fire its powerful laser to execute the soldiers, but it was suddenly destroyed with a punch from a red-blue blur that came speeding past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" asked one of the pilots.<br>\r\n\"Is that another plane?\" asked another.<br>\r\n\"No ... that's a boy\" said the lead pilot \"That's the Red Diamond!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilots watched in awe as the preteen powerhouse engaged hundreds of light orbs in a dogfight. Now the tables were turned, as the boy annihilated the orbs one by one with heavy, super-fast kicks and punches. He threw the orbs into each other to take out several at the same time, and shot lasers out of his eyes to pulverize any orbs which tried to get away into specks of dust. Most of the lasers that the orbs fired at the boy missed, but the few that hit him barely stung his nearly-invulnerable skin. With that, he left the parts to burn up as they came down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red Diamond! Our aircraft!\" called the lead pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca looked down and saw the burning wrecks of several fighter jets about to come down on a small town. With a loud sonic boom, Luca darted off fearlessly after the jets. He barely reached them in time to knock them out of the way of the town, sending them crashing safely into a nearby field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Our bots have been destroyed?!\" cried the alien commander in his spaceship \"Impossible! Humans don't have that sort of technology to deal with them. We'll have to deploy our missiles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca looked up to the sky and saw hundreds of homing missiles drop into the atmosphere, headed for every major city on the planet. \"Uh oh\" he said as he darted off again, to the cheers of the people in the town he had just rescued from disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Luca flew right around the surface of the planet as fast as he could. Skies the world over were filled with red and blue blurs as Luca rushed past. Each time he hit a missile there would be a huge explosion in the sky, and Luca would fly out of it faster than the explosion could singe his cape. Together with the world's missile defense systems, the alien missiles blew up in the sky before they could hit land. Feeling tired, Luca landed on top of a tall building in his home city and lay down, breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this!\" cried out the alien commander \"These puny humans can't be doing this on their own - they must have some alien help. I think we need to deploy our planet blaster.\"<br>\r\n\"But sir, that will destroy the whole planet, not just the humans living on it.\"<br>\r\n\"I know. But that is a price we are willing to pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luca lay there, he noticed a beam of light up in the sky, heading straight for the ground. With a sigh of frustration, Luca got up and darted off into the sky once more.<br>\r\nWith the strength to obliterate the entire planet behind it, the beam hurtled towards the planet. Luca flew fearlessly towards it, and for a split second, the world stood still. All over every TV channel on the globe, people tuned in to watch a cute preteen boy in a spandex costume fly directly towards a ray of certain doom from outer space. People gasped as they wondered what would happen next, moments before the two collided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an enormous flash of light on impact as the beam struck Luca's body. Luca felt a terrible pain as his body was flung back down towards the planet by the beam. As he tried to push against this unrelenting force, he could feel the bright white streak tear into his flesh and vaporize part of his costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something seems to be blocking the beam\" said the weapons-master onboard the alien spacecraft.<br>\r\n\"Increase the power!\" commanded the commander, pulling a lever to set the power from \"Medium\" to \"Maximum\" himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh!\" screamed Luca in pain, as his impossibly strong muscles clenched tight. Still the beam was clearly having an effect, and Luca felt as though he couldn't hold on much longer. He tried using his laser vision, but it didn't seem to work while so much of his energy was having to be focused on stopping the beam. It felt as though the beam was moments away from tearing right THROUGH him, and killing him in the process. Luca was about to close his eyes, realizing the end had come ... when suddenly, out of the corner of his super-vision, he noticed a small speck of light heading directly for the alien UFO that was firing at him. Moments later there was a small explosion at the bottom of the UFO, and the beam stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, something has struck our planet blaster\" explained the weapons-master \"It isn't serious damage but it will take some time to repair.\"<br>\r\n\"What! Curse these puny creatures!\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever that missile was, sir, it must have been quite the ingenious design. We didn't see it coming at all until it was too late.\"<br>\r\n\"I think the best course would be to fall back, and return with reinforcements later.\" said the captain \"We'll have to analyze how they were able to overcome our weapons when we get back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca flew up to the sky, but the UFO was faster than he was, and shot away through the solar system. It was only then that he looked down and saw the enormous bruise on his muscular chest where the beam had struck him. It was really painful, but even as he watched it, he saw it healing up incredibly quickly.<br>\r\n\"I guess I do have super healing powers\" he mused to himself \"I wonder what it was that stopped that beam though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Luca stepped out of the changing room shower in the public pool. Luckily, everyone had been so busy watching the sky that they hadn't noticed Luca taking an extra-long shower.<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" asked Caleb \"You were awesome up there!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks,\" replied Luca, still feeling sore and worn out \"I'll be fine\"<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca sat down and breathed heavily. \"My gut tells me,\" he said gravely, \"That was just the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in another part of town, Macie was in her backyard with a small rocket launchpad and a telescope.<br>\r\n\"That's right, alien morons\" she muttered to herself spitefully, shaking her fist towards the sky \"Only one person gets to destroy Luca, and that's the smartest, cutest and all-around best girl in the world. And that would be me.\"<br>\r\nWith that she took her equipment back inside, satisfied at herself for having saved the life of a superhero.</span></div></div>",

So one morning, Matt wakes up to get ready for school. He comes down to see his sisters at the table. One was Melissa, his 18 year old sister who was 5'6\" (it made her mad that Matt was taller), average build, and had D-Cup breasts. She was quite a jerk, especially to Matt. \"Oh, hi, loser.\" said Melissa. \"Melissa, you need to stop insulting your brother!\" said Matt's mom. Matt's other sister was Kristi, who was 9 years old. \"Well, I'm off to school.\" said Matt. Matt went outside and hopped on his bike, and pedalled all the way to school. His girlfriend, Jenny, was waiting there. Jenny had blonde hair, and she was 5'6\", yet only 130 lbs., and she had B-Cup breasts. She was quite smart, but not as smart as Matt. \"Hi!\" shouted Jenny. \"Hi.\" responded Matt as he arrived on his bike. They went in to see Anthony Colorado, or just Tony, who was another one of their friends, with his girlfriend, Riley. Tony was 5'5\" and was 160 lbs., so he was quite fit. Riley was 5'4\", 150 lbs., and she had C-Cup breasts. They exchanged greetings, then moved on. Matt then saw some more of their friends, the two sets of twins. One was Sam and Joey. Sam was older, he was 5'6\", yet skinnier than his brother at 155 lbs.. Joey was 5'5\" and 160 lbs.. The other pair of twins were Macy and Stacy. The odd thing about them is they had a natural dark blue hair that came down to their waist. Macy was the younger one, at 5'4\", 150 lbs., and she had C-Cup breasts. Stacy was 5'5\", 155 lbs., and had D-Cup breasts. What Matt thought was funny was that Stacy had breasts just as big as his sister, if not bigger, as she was just 14. Joey was Stacy's boyfriend, and Sam was Macy's. Matt enjoyed having so many friends, but one thing he hated was the fact that he was the skinniest. Even Jenny had more muscle than him. This often times made Matt get bullied, especially by his older sister. Matt tried several times to work out, but it yielded nothing.

Today we're going to do weightlifting outside. Normally we'd do it inside, but because of our... ah-hem, resident hulk, it would be better. As they were leaving to go outside, the teacher stopped Matt.<br>\r\n\"Ya know, you really shouldn't use steroids, Matt. I know you were skinny and all before, but...\"<br>\r\n\"Um, its not steroids. Its genetics, actually...\"<br>\r\n\"You must have some weird family... I'll see your mother after school. Anyways, I have two trailers out there filled with stuff. Each one weighs around 2 tons. You think you can pick that up?\"<br>\r\n\"I'll try.\"<br>\r\nSo they go outside. Matt saw Macy and Stacy both lift 60 lbs. or so. Matt went over to the two trailers. Everyone outside at that moment stopped what they were doing to see whether he could do it. Matt started to lift one in each hand. It was very difficult, even though he was so big. Suddenly, he started to have a headache. Everyone started hearing a crack. The teacher was about to go inside to call the hospital, thinking that Matt had broken a bone, but Macy stopped him. Everyone stood in astonishment as Matt seemed to get bigger. Slowly his shirt filled up, and he was starting be able to lift the trailers. His shirt started to rip, and his pants started to do the same. Fortunately, he stopped growing, and was about 8'7\"- 3 whole feet taller than he was a few days ago! He lifted the trailers up at that point with ease. The teacher just stared at Matt.<br>\r\n\"That's some weird genetics...\" he said.<br>\r\nAll the girls looked at his bulge, yearning it to grow a bit more, so they could see what was behind his pants.</span></div></div>",

As he was walking down the hall, he noticed a kid who was carrying something fragile. A bully came from behind and knocked him down. Matt tried to reach for the object, but it was too far away. The kid looked in horror as it reached the ground- except it didn't. It hovered above the ground. Everyone around looked in surprise. Jenny was the first one to speak.<br>\r\n\"Matt? Did you do that?\"<br>\r\nMatt was unsure, but he thought about the object coming to him. Slowly but surely, it did. Matt was glad- he had learned telekinesis! He handed the boy the object, and then took a glance at the bully, who quickly ran away. Jenny took a quick look at Matt. She then stepped back in shock as she realized Matt had grown. They went to art class. The art class was mostly girls for some reason. Before class started, most of the girls were either staring at Matt, envying Jenny, or both. When class started, the teacher started out by saying \"Today, we are going to paint an object. There are several things around the room you can use-\"<br>\r\n\"What about Matt?\" one of the girls asked.<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... okay then. Matt, come on up here.\"<br>\r\nMatt came up.<br>\r\n\"Take your clothes off! It'll be much better to draw your muscles when we can see them!\" shouted another girl.<br>\r\n\"Ummm, okay. Matt, start taking your clothes off...\"<br>\r\n\"Even my boxers?\"<br>\r\nSince there were mostly girls in that room, an almost unanimous \"YES!\" was heard.<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" started the teacher. But right at that moment, Matt started to have another headache.<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not again...\"<br>\r\nEveryone heard a few cracks, and Matt started to get taller. The remnants of his shirt tore off, and the same for his pants. His boxers started to get tears from the massive thing behind. Soon his boxers lost the battle and Matt's 2 foot long dick was revealed. The girls all stared at it.<br>\r\n\"It's even bigger than what I thought!\" one girl said. Matt was now 9'1\" tall!<br>\r\n\"Umm... ermmm... well, get started painting!\" said the teacher.<br>\r\n\"Hey, can you get me a mirror?\" Matt asked the teacher.<br>\r\n\"Sure. Why, though?\"<br>\r\n\"So I can paint myself.\"<br>\r\n\"No, you need to stay in that pose!\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, I can do it while doing this pose...\"<br>\r\nThe teacher shrugged and got the mirror. Matt used his telekinetic powers to bring his easel, brush, and paint over. He started painting himself, using his powers to make the brush float so he could stay in his current pose. Some of the girls hadn't started yet, as they were still staring at his dick.</span></div></div>",

They weren't enough people for them to have seperate teams. On the swim team were Matt, Tony, Riley, Sam, Joey, and 4 other girls.

Well, at least he's more popular with the girls then he originally was. As they were swimming, Matt found it a bit hard. His chest was so big it touched the bottom of the swimming pool on the shallow end. His chest was also above the water when he stood in the deep end. All of a sudden, he was overcome with a headache. He started growing again! His 8-pack abs morphed into a 12-pack, and his pecs were starting to get almost to the point where each one was bigger than he was a few days ago. His swimming trunks started to tear, and Matt hoped they wouldn't burst open. Unfortunately, he just kept growing, growing to the point where his swimming trunks ripped off, revealing a now 2'3\" long cock. When some of the girls saw this, they suddenly wanted to touch it. Matt kept them away with his telekinetic power. He was starting to get annoyed with the attention his dick caused. He looked around, and estimated he was now 9'7\".

Instead, they just keep growing until the age of 20. Now, you're probably wondering why I said so much about humans in our dimension and nothing about your daughter, right?\" - again, they both nodded - \"Well, my race is trying to figure out exactly how they grow so much. So we developed a ray gun that can cause people to undergo these changes, and we just used that on your daughter. Well, goodbye!\" And with that, the aliens disappeared.

It actually tasted good, and it seemed it had some form of oxygen that he could breathe simply by drinking the liquid. Little did he know, he was in a vat of a special liquid the aliens had. The liquid had nutrients in it, so a person could live in there for years. Matt looked to his left and saw another tube. In it was Jenny. Jenny woke up, and then realized she was okay. An alien came in front of them and typed something onto a console. Suddenly, electricity zapped Matt's brain. While being shocked, Matt could see that the same was happening to Jenny.

Matt always hated doing that, since it was a perfect time for the guys to point out he was weaker than most of the girls.

Jenny was doing 95 lbs., so that if Matt failed 100, he wouldn't be mocked by her doing 100. Jenny started at the same time as Matt (partially due to their telepathic connection). They both struggled a bit, Matt more than Jenny. All of a sudden, headaches came over both of them, at the same time. Everyone in the gym heard cracking noises- coming from Matt and Jenny. One could see that they were getting taller! Matt's body started filling up with muscle, his abs and pecs becoming well defined, his arms trembling with the surge of growth that was upon them. Soon, his chest started to push through his shirt, and it started ripping. Soon, it fell off, and Matt's shorts started splitting from both his legs and his bulge, which was noticeably bigger. Soon they came off, and at that point Matt lifted the weight above his head- with one hand! He wasn't done growing yet, and his boxers were fighting a losing battle. Soon they snapped off, and revealed a dick longer than what a 14 year old should've had. Jenny also started growing, her muscles ripping off her shirt, leaving her in her bra, which was starting to become very tight, as her breasts decided to be B-Cup no more. Her pants ripped off soon enough, her legs much thicker than before. Soon her bra snapped off, revealing breasts as llarge as bowling balls. Soon Matt and Jenny reached their new heights, 6'1\" and 5'11\" respectively. Matt was now stronger than Jenny, since he was taller and could fit more muscle on him. They were shocked that they both grew at the same exact time. Most of the guys wanted Jenny as their girlfriend, seeing as she was now quite hot, especially without her clothes, and all the guys were jealous about Matt, as he was now taller and stronger than anyone there, and his dick was probably the largest. All the girls wanted Matt to be their boyfriend and were jealous of Jenny. Soon both groups realized that their wishes wouldn't come true. The perfect match for a Superboy was a Supergirl. They didn't know about the telepathic connection they shared, but if they did, it would only make them unhappier. The gym teacher stood in awe, then said \"I... uh... better get you some clothes...\" and he left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: the Superpower they discovered today was super strength. However, they will grow like this every growth spurt)</span></div></div>",

Their school didn't have the funding for two separate swim teams, so they combined them. Some parents complained that it was a bad idea, but they had it anyways. Matt was wearing green swimming trunks that were a bit tight, and Jenny was wearing a pink bikini that showed a bit of her breasts, but she couldn't help it, considering how it was the biggest they could find. The coach wanted them to practice on their own today, so there were no adults except for a couple security guards. As they were swimming, both Jenny and Matt experienced a headache. Soon they both started growing again. Matt's bulge became quite apparent in his already too tight swim trunks. Jenny's breasts were the main cause of her bikini starting to tear, but the rest of her growing didn't help. Soon Matt's abs were each as big as bricks. His swimming trunks broke off, and every girl (except Jenny) in the room was attracted to his dick. The guards didn't notice a thing, as they were snoozing. Jenny's bikini snapped off, leaving breasts larger than over inflated beach balls. Soon both were naked and trying to avoid the attention their new bodies brought.</span></div></div>",

She lived in the Utica Orphanage Asylum, in Utica, New York. She had short red hair, with green eyes. She had a slight farmer's tan, contrary to the popular ginger stereotype, and freckles along her cheekbones. Her teeth weren't perfect, but she didn't care as much as the other girls her age did. The orphanage she had lived in most of her life was an all girls orphanage, but Zoe preferred the company of other boys instead of most girls. She was one of the average tomboys, she knew how to throw a punch and a baseball better than some of her friends even. Yet despite all her confidence, she was wracked with anxiety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two main reasons for being anxious. One of those reasons was understandable. She was a closeted lesbian in a conservative Upstate New York Oneida County, where the majority of the people where conservative Republican.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other reason why she was anxious was because one day a week after her fifteenth birthday she discovered that she could breath underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had discovered this with Frankie, the only person who knew she was a lesbian. One of Frankie's friends from school, Jeremy, was being picked on by several wealthy kids from North Utica High School. Frankie had gone over to fight the boys on the beach deck where they were hanging out. One of the bigger boys from the North side picked Frankie up and threw him into the water. Frankie was a midget, and therefore landed in twelve feet deep water. And he couldn't swim, so he preceded to drown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe hadn't intended on fighting the other boys, she was only 5'3 and 120 pounds and there were five of them, so she had tried to dive into the water. As she was running, she had tripped, yelling \"Aw crap!\" and crashed face first into the water without holding her breath. She swam down twelve feet and carried her unconscious friend up to shore a good thirty feet down the lake. When she brought him to land, she did CPR and revived him. As Frankie gasped for air, he saw that she had gills on her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found out that the gills disappeared once she was all dry, and only reappeared once she went deep enough under water. The duo then began  their search as to why she had gills, and that she should keep a supply of scarves ready at hand.</span></div></div>",

He had considered taking a job at a woodworking workshop after the year was out, seeing as he had the skills, yet his parents had wanted him to go to college. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't the most attractive boy in the world, although with a new haircut there had been much improvement. He had short brown hair with a few small streaks dark blonde in the front due to being in the sun a lot. He had green eyes and a good build. Yet, he wasn't all too muscular in the chest of stomach area, being 140 pounds. He had slightly muscled arms, and very muscular legs. His face wasn't too unattractive, yet there were spots of acne to the left of his chin. There were dark bangs under his eyes from being over worked at his summer job and not being able to get enough sleep at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonovan yawned as he opened his locker at school. He was wearing a brown hoodie with a gray T-shirt underneath. He had decent looking jeans, or at least he thought so. \"I should have worn shorts, it's eighty degrees outside.\" He thought to himself as he put his newly found Forensics textbook into his locker. \"Oh look! There's Donnie! I haven't seen him all summer!\" He heard his friend Joel say. He turned around, expecting to see him right behind him, yet he was at the other end of the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did he hear him so clearly? Had he yelled? No, if he'd yelled then everyone would be looking at him. Then he had a thought that made his stomach drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas his schizophrenia coming back? He hadn't been fooled by the voices in his head for years. In fact, he hadn't even heard any voices in his head since his therapy had stopped. He'd met other people suffering from the same.....condition....and they had explained how sometimes new voices and images popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Oneida.\" Joel said as he came closer with their mutual friend Kevin. Joel had a Texan accent, whereas Donovan had an Upstate New York accent. the odds of them ending up going to school together in Delaware were quite surprising to say the least. Kevin was the only local amongst the trio. They all called each other nicknames based on where they were from. Donovan was Oneida, being from Oneida County in New York. Joel was Tex or Texas, being from Dallas Texas. And Kevin was either called Townie or Deli. Most people called Kevin anyways because he worked at the local Deli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it goin' Texas? How's your' summer been?\" Donovan asked, cracking a smile to his anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n( So basically Donovan's first power was super hearing. He had a problem with schizophrenia when he was younger but has it for the most part under control. He's anxious because he thinks he has a new voice in his head.)</span></div></div>",

This burst of energy immediately reminded the young teenage girl how exciting the following days promised to be. Indeed, not many girls around her could reasonably wake up each passing days with the fantastic yet very real hope to be enhanced superhumanly both physically and mentally. On second thought, Lena was well aware to be the only one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this thought crossed her mind, she leaped out from her bed to the full-length mirror on the other side of the room and checked out her own reflection.

Her raven blond hair cascaded down her shoulders in the most elegant sweeps. The skin was richly tanned and baby smooth, not a trace of wrinkles. And their eyes \u2013 what a pair of blue piercing eyes! They seemed to glow a blue light on their own. On second thought, Lena\u2019s face appeared to be incredibly beautiful to Charlotte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Lena! I love your makeup today! You must give me some advice one of these days\u2026\u201d said Charlotte while going into the kitchen to heat the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t wear makeup sis\u2019\u2026 I\u2019m naturally gorgeous!\u201d Lena answered still laying on the sofa. <br>\r\nAs she was pouring hot water into a cup of tea, Charlotte noted inwardly not to pay her sister other compliments in the future. She tried to think about something else and drank the boiling tea. After a while, she heard Lena footstep coming to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte\u2019s eyes popped when she saw her younger sister going into the room. The blond teenage girl was wearing a loose-fitting hooded sweatshirt which tightened on her unbelievably narrow waist and, most importantly, the most butt hugging pair of black shiny leggings Charlotte had ever seen with white wedge sneakers. As Lena leaned to the fridge, Charlotte couldn\u2019t help but stare awestruck at the perfect round and firm ass of her sister. The black spandex material wrapped around her buns of steel like the ones you see on those professional fitness model pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharlotte, is it okay? What are you staring at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte finally stopped ogling at the toned thighs before her eyes and looked back at the blue piercing eyes of her sister. She realized Lena was true about the makeup because the strikingly stunning face before her definitely didn\u2019t need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, say something! Oh\u2026 Is it because of the leggings I wear?\u201d Lena said knowing perfectly her sister didn\u2019t want to comment on how perfectly shaped her long legs and butt looked. Still looking at Charlotte, she half turned to present her perfect profile and ran her hands on the two firm rounded buttocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can wear these pair anymore for school\u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t want to give any male in a hundred yards an erection wherever I walk!\u201d she giggled with a cute laugh. Both girls knew this was not only a joke but one of them did not want to admit that Lena\u2019s ass was out of this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so conceited Lena! Okay, these leggings fit you pretty well but, hey, you\u2019re not a fitness model!\u201d Charlotte grumbled while trying inwardly to understand how her sister could surpass any fitness model she\u2019d ever seen on the net without working out. <br>\r\nLena loved the way her older sister was bloody-minded. Charlotte was only a plain mortal woman while she was the one transforming into a super hot girl. She knew the situation was more than harsh for Charlotte but\u2026 Who cares? She smiled to her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m not a fitness model! To be honest, I\u2019m way better than any fitness models around the net\u2026\u201d </span></div></div>",

Lena didn\u2019t have to know how embittered she felt. Faced to the conceited one, Charlotte preferred adopting the same behavior and playing the game. She leaned over the table and pressed her C cup breasts together, giving Lena a full insight of her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may be better than a fitness model, Miss perfect bitch, but you\u2019ll never have such a cleavage with your B cup!\u201d she said wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! Charlotte! I\u2019m so jealous of your body?\u201d Lena said with a mischievous smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked along the table while rolling her toned hips and started to zip down her hoody. \u201cI would d kill to have you fucking great figure\u201d. As she was zipping down the sweatshirt, Charlotte\u2019s jaw literally dropped. The blond teenage girl was wearing a skintight crop top that could almost contain a perfectly round DD cup breast and made her six-pack almost intimidating. As she totally removed her hoody, Lena inspired a bit deeper, making her chest grow, her gravity defying tits almost ripping apart the fabric of the skintight black top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally sat on the table just before Charlotte, revealing even more of her long, tightly muscled crossed legs. Charlotte had difficulty in expressing herself. Her younger sister was definitely the sexiest creature she\u2019d ever seen and there were no way to conceal it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL\u2026 Lena, what happened to you?? You can\u2019t be\u2026 that HOT! I mean\u2026 This is not biologically possible to transform into\u2026 that!\u201d Charlotte stammered while gesturing to Lena\u2019s magnificent curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo emphasize Charlotte\u2019s point, Lena jumped to her feet and stood before her sister, one hand on her luscious hips and the other one through her golden blond curls. \u201cLet\u2019s say that my genes are a little better than expected\u2026 But don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll know everything soon enough!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAt these words, Lena turned down and walked out letting her sister drool with envy over her breathtakingly hot rounded butt. Just before getting out, Charlotte called to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLena! It\u2019s okay not to tell me what happened with you but\u2026 if there was a way I could get through the same\u2026 transformation, would you tell me what to do?\u201d Charlotte asked with puppy eyes. Lena stopped and turned back to look Charlotte with their piercing blue eyes. She seemed to hesitate before answering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything soon, I swear! But, right now, you just have to know that I\u2019m the only one\u2026 Just consider life has been a little bit unfair with you, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Lena sounded almost sincere\u2026 </span></div></div>",

Actually Betty, who was known as the chubby friend of Lena, didn\u2019t really draw any attention but let\u2019s say she was walking next to the hottest girl any male students have never seen into these walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople seemed to move aside before every steps of the long legged teenage model who was walking confidently to the lockers. Well aware of the insistent gazes over her perfectly rounded butt tightly hugged in the shiny material of her leggings, Lena didn\u2019t hesitate to roll her toned hips which caused some embarrassing hard-on in more and more male pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce before the lockers, Betty couldn\u2019t hold it anymore. She stopped and stared blatantly at the hourglass figure of her blond friend who was opening her locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, oh my god, oh my god, Lena! Did you see that? Everybody was absolutely drooling at you! I was like totally invisible!\u201d Betty said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena smiled. \u201cInvisible? Sorry to sound rude but do you think people would rather look at you or\u2026\u201d She turned to her profile and let Betty take in the ridiculously hot contrast between her impossibly slim waist and her massive and perky young breasts \u201c\u2026 Or look at that!\u201d She gestured to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty felt a hint of jealousy but the excitement of what she had just heard about Lena was overtaking everything else.<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon! Nobody can compete with you now! I mean\u2026 You\u2019re Supergirl! This is so cool!\u201d She said while staring at the toned side abs of her friend which was fully visible under her short crop top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd apart from your super hearing, do you have some other\u2026 super powers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet but I feel constantly fully energized and\u2026\u201d Lena answered before fixing Betty\u2019s breast with an insistent look. Betty didn\u2019t dare to disturb her friend but wonder why Lena was staring at the black jacket she wore with her gorgeous sapphire-blue eyes. <br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Lena smiled triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetty, I didn\u2019t know you were one of those girls who wear some Victoria Secret push up bras? A black one besides\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a couple a seconds, Betty dreaded to wear a see-through jacket but she rapidly realized what just happened \u201cD-did you just see my bras through the material of my jacket?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, Lena didn\u2019t listen at her friend anymore. She seemed to scan everything and everybody around her with her piercing blue eyes. First only able to see through thin material of clothes, she soon achieved to look into classrooms through solid concrete walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is sooo cool Betty! Every guys around me looked like they are walking naked! And I just have to lower my X-ray vision a bit to see them in underwear\u2026 Beuah! Ms Thompsons is wearing a thong, just\u2026 disgusting!\u201d Lena turned back to Betty and laughed. \u201cWow! First time I see you totally naked, it\u2019s so fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty immediately felt self conscious to appear without any clothes before her enhanced friend. She didn\u2019t want Lena to laugh at her chubby curves while her best friend was now blessed with impossibly hot assets\u2026 And sure enough she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 Betty, don\u2019t you think you should be on a diet? I mean\u2026 Looking at you starkers is\u2026 well, forget it, hehe\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty went as red as a beet. She pretended to cover herself with her arms but realized the usefulness of such an act. If Lena wanted to see her naked, she couldn\u2019t do anything about it except begging her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Lena\u2026 C-Can you stop scanning me! I feel uncomfortable\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, it\u2019s just a joke! Anyhow I can\u2019t help but see through whatever I want! It\u2019s just like nobody can hide before me! Sooo\u2026 You should get used to be naked for my superhuman eyes!\u201d Lena said excitedly without noticing her friend discomfort.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cIt must be so cool! I can\u2019t even imagine what it feels to have such a power! I hope you intend to relate me everything that will happen to you! I\u2019m so excited to be the best friend of a living goddess!\u201d Betty said while trying to get composure. These words gave Lena a slight smile. She bent to Betty and whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m going to give you every details of my fucking dreaming life!\u201d Lena said before turning to the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 And for my part, I\u2019m so excited to BE a living goddess\u201d She added with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the classroom, Lena\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Lena strode confidently into the classroom, she allowed one strap of her crop-top to slip from her shoulder exposing slightly more of the upper curve of her right breast.  Everyone in the class seemed to stop whatever they were doing just to watch the young, budding goddess simply move to her seat and slip into the chair.  Crossing her arms made the other strap slip off her left shoulder making the already skimpy top slip down further to reveal more of her perfectly tanned cleavage.  Mr. White snapped himself out of it reluctantly peeling his eyes away and approaching Lena.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena looked up from her seat innocently knowing full well what Mr. White was staring at as he stood over her.  Her nipples stood at attention, the outline of them clearly visible through the thin top, and clearly displaying the fact that she was wearing no bra.  As he tried to gather his words, Lena reached up pulling her thick, luscious mane into a ponytail making her breasts jiggle slightly and her abdominal wall dance.  \"Yes, Mr. White?  Did you want to speak with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem- yes, Lena.  Yes, I have to say that your attire is not appropriate for school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, what do you mean, Mr. White?\"  Lena pouted looking down at herself even getting a little turned on at how amazing she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. White leaned in to whisper so as not to embarrass Lena in front of the class.  \"For starters, you're not wearing a bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena got goosebumps from Mr. White's warm breath traveling down her neck.  Apparently, she was also super-sensitive and her nipples were now practically hard as bullets.  She whispered back, \"Does it look like I need one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, Mr. White shot up recoiling from Lena trying restrain himself from his own very male response.  \"I'm going to need you put something else on, Lena.  Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I borrow some scissors?\"  Lena was already up and moving to Mr. White's desk to retrieve his pair and presented them to him and the class.  \"You want me to wear something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class responded with a resounding \"yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. White stammered, \"Wha-wait, I'm sure that is not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but just this once because you asked so nicely, Mr. White.\"  Promptly, she began to cut at the lower hem of her crop-top.  Interestingly, she found the sharp end of the scissor blade quite a pleasant feeling when she accidentally stab her breast.  She cut the hem up to just one inch below her nipples exposing the under side of her DD bow sitting high, perky, and with just a hint of jiggle.  She also cut the straps turning the crop-top into a tube top now only being held in place by the size of her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about that?\"  Lena bit her lip waiting for Mr. White's reaction.  If he was staring before, he practically hypnotized now.  Giggling, Lena brought the scissors to her tight leggings and began to snip away the legs to reveal the bottom of her perfect, tightly muscled buttocks and her fit, tanned legs.  THe leggings were now nothing more than scandalously short shorts.  Satisfied with her work, she placed the scissors back onto the desk and returned to her seat.  Knowing everyone was watching intently, she bent over at the waist to retrieve her notebook giving anyone behind a full view of her rear as the already short shorts rode higher on her butt and a good view of underboob.  Everyone in front of her was treated to the wonder site of her cleavage as her breasts only jiggled slightly while she dug through her pack.  Lena stood back up, adjusted her breasts in her tube top, and took her seat not noticing that her rear had left dents in the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you going to teach us something or do I get to show off some more?\"  Lena beamed sitting upright so show as much breast as she could. </span></div></div>",

Or is Mr Pointy going to have to come out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther really hoped he was talking about the knife in his hands. She was a good looking girl, and she knew it: wide hips, thin waist, boobs, the works. Her face was pretty, although that was hard to see with her long brown hair stuck to it with sweat. All in all, a tempting target for a back-ally scum like this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mugger - a homeless-looking guy wearing a beanie - grabbed the back of her neck and hoisted her into the air, brushing the edge of his knife against her throat. \"Your wallet. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther made a frustrated noise, before slowly reaching into her skirt. As soon as the leather was free of the cloth, the mugger grabbed it out of her hands, dropping her and running with the stolen good. As he did so, his knife made a shallow cut on the front of her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther took a minute to just lie on the ground, regaining her breath. <i>Take a shortcut home from school, girl. Nothing can go wrong with that. Yeah right. On the bright side, at least I still have my phone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetrieving said object from her other skirt pocket, she dialed her home. <i>\"Yes, honey?\"</i> Her mother answered the phone. She always did seem to know when Esther was calling, even though her home phone lacked caller ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got mugged, Mom. Call you call the bank and tell them - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh dear! Are you alright?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Mom.\" Esther waved her mothers concerns away. She peaked down the front of her shirt. Actually, considering how hard she'd hit the ground, she was expecting to see the start of some bruised on her front; but she couldn't see anything of the sort. \"But he took my wallet, and - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Forget the wallet, dear!\"</i> Her mom interrupted. <i>\"What about you?</i> She paused. <i>\"Did anything... strange happen?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What kind of question was that?</i> \"No, Mom. I'm fine.\" She reached up to rub at her throat. <i>Huh?</i> She couldn't feel where she knew she had been cut. Nor could she feel the blood that had been leaking out of her just a minute ago. <i>That's weird, but if I told Mom she'd freak out about it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, hurry on home then dear. I'll feel better when I can see you with my own eyes.\"</i> With that, she hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther sighed as she put away her mobile. She loved her parents, really she did, but they asked the weirdest questions at the weirdest times. When she'd asked her mom about her knack for answering the door before anyone knocked, she'd counter-asked if Esther had ever felt the urge to do the same. When there had been a radiation scare from the local reactor, her dad had asked if the gamma rays tasted like lemon to her. That sort of thing. This was just another case in a string of weird things that had been going on all her life.</span></div></div>",

He was always building them, but as far as Esther knew, they were purely decorative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear,\" Her mother said, closing the door. \"we - that is, your father and I - are aliens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther stared at both her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father coughed into his hand. \"You see, there was a bit of a political issue - your great-grandparents were Gene-blenders, and that became illegal in the universe and large, so we thought we'd avoid all that and live on a nice pre-FTL world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, Esther found words bubbling up from the back of her throat, even through the shock. \"Gene... blenders...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something of a scientific technique, mixed with religious belief.\" Her mother answered smoothly. \"It goes that all sapient life was once one super-race that got fragmented, so it is the duty of those living now to 'blend' all the existing races back into this super-race.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your grandparents were some of the furthest in the field, mixing genetic engineering with plain old cross-breeding to weed out all the negative traits and emphasize the positive ones.\" Her father continued. \"But, as I said, people started worrying that they were making some sort of super-warrior, so we, as a family, dropped out of sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Esther asked weakly. \"I'm not just <i>an</i> alien, I'm <i>all</i> the aliens...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother laughed. \"No dear, do you have any idea how many races there are in the universe? ...well, probably not. No, your father and I hold the DNA of a good dozen races apiece, and you hold the mix of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the sounds of it, you've finally started your third puberty.\" Her father said as though it wasn't completely ridiculous. \"Your extraterrestrial traits should finally start making themselves known.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder when you'll get my ESP?\" Her mother gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not before she learns to fly, I bet.\" Her father bragged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther somehow found a chair and collapsed bonelessly onto it.</span></div></div>",

You're a young lady, now.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother's voice was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's not coming from inside my head or anything. It feels more like... it's coming from my collarbone?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n{There's a fascinating species over 200 light-years from here that has a small organ that acts like an organic radio. There's no such thing as telepathy, but this is a pretty good substitute.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock fading off, Esther's aggravation was returning. {Leave me alone.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{Ah, you figured it out already? It's been so boring having no one to talk to with this!}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther pulled her chin up, staring daggers into her wall. {Why didn't you tell me?}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{About your lineage? Dear, it is a fact throughout the universe that children cannot keep a secret. Your father and I believed that you wouldn't want the whole town to know?}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That is a stupidly logical reason.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther stared in silence for a minute. {...so what happens now?}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{Nothing, if you don't want anything to happen.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{I don't.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{Although, you will need to tell your father or I if you start growing a tail. That'll have to be amputated immediately.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurred to Esther only after she snorted that her mother might not have been joking. {...what's happening to me?}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{As it happens, the more impressive bits of your biology are the bits that develop last. Over the next year or so, you'll find new abilities and traits grow in. Nothing to be afraid off.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{But I'm not <i>human</i>.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{No, dear. But you never wanted to be a human. You wanted to be a <i>person</i>. That hasn't changed. You can still go to school. You can still get whatever job you please. You can even fall in love, although your great-grandparents will throw a fit.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{Wait, they're still around?!}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{Dear, how did you think you were born? Neither your father or I are anywhere good enough with genetic engineering to mix our genes and have you not turn out a right mess.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther felt a sudden surge of curiosity towards how her family tree worked exactly, and then crushed it ruthlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{...thanks, Mom.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{You're welcome, dear.}</span></div></div>",

The following day, you realize that you can see through walls. A few hours later, you discover you can fly! A few days later, you realize you have super strength. The following week, you discover you have heat vision and super speed! One-by-one, your powers begin to develop. It almost becomes hard NOT to use them! You're just too \"super\"! How do you adjust to normal life at home and at school, as a super-kid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you cautiously tell your parents you've been experiencing strange feelings. Then, you find out you were an alien! How do you take that? Then, you must cope with \"being normal\" at school. How do you adjust to being a \"super-kid\" among \"normal\" students? Do you tell anyone? Do you show off to your best friend? What happens when you get bullied in school? what do you do, when you start seeing and hearing everything that happens around you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, do you decide to become a super hero? How do you pick a costume? Or, do you remain undercover? This is your chance to create a new super hero character!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease: NO sex, no vore, no killing off anyone, no curse words, no one-line chapters, or the like. I will delete and/or edit chapters as I see needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may add as many powers to your hero or heroine as you like. Make it fun and interesting. What I'm looking for, is that the hero (or heroine) doesn't know what powers he or she has until they surface, and he or she has to learn how to use them once he discovers what his powers are. Give him (or her) as many powers as you wish; you can practically make him omnipotent as long as he (or she) becomes a super hero and not a villain. The whole idea is that you create an \"origin\" story for a superhero here. I would love to see the \"hero\" as a character who is shy, timid, humble, and maybe even a little scared of all the powers he suddenly comes to possess. You can give him (or her) the ability to become invisible, to grow into a giant, to fire lasers from his fists, to teleport, to have telekinesis, or even to control other people's minds. How would he or she deal with all those powers, at home, at school, or when he's with his friends or his relatives?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***I will award 500 Gift Points to complete, acceptable, and well-written chapters of 300 words or longer.***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex  <b><a href=\"/main/authors.php?action=search&amp;search_for=rextorres\" target=\"_blank\">rextorres</a></b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor questions about this story, you may contact <b><a href=\"/main/authors.php?action=search&amp;search_for=rextorres\" target=\"_blank\">rextorres</a></b> and <b><a href=\"/main/authors.php?action=search&amp;search_for=7....7\" target=\"_blank\">7....7</a></b> . <br>\r\n</td>",
