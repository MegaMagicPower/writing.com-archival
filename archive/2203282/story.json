They all wanted to see what that power source they detected was... only to find out they had been chasing each other.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Well,\" Sonic said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah...\" Mario said.  The two stared at each other awkwardly while Bowser and Dr. Eggman glared at one another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"This is a colossal waste of time,\" Bowser said, turning to leave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I agree,\" Dr. Eggman grumped.  \"Move out.  We're going home!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I don't know,\" Peach said, admiring the architecture of the stadium.  \"A little cleaning, some magic here and there, and it would make a great place for an Olympic stadium.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMario blinked.  \"You serious?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSally frowned.  \"Wait, magic?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPeach nodded, creating some sparkles.  \"Our kingdom is rife with magic.  Maybe combining it with your world's technology, we can set up some great games.\"  She turned to Bowser and Eggman, the latter still leaving, the former having stopped to listen.  \"You all are invited, of course, so long as you play fair.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You have got to be kidding,\" Eggman said.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t\"...No, no, we've done this before,\" Bowser said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"SERIOUSLY?!\" Eggman asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBowser nodded.  \"Yeah.  Sometimes I go go-karting with these losers.  Or play sports, or this giant magic board game thing...\" he shrugged.  \"It's something to do between conquest attempts.  And honestly,\" he added with a vicious grin, \"its rather satisfying to beat them in fair combat.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPeach nodded.  \"Paranormal-level abilities would be suppressed, of course,\" she said.  \"To keep everything fair.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No zipping around at the speed of sound for you if we take part,\" Tails said to Sonic, getting the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSonic snorted.  \"Don't know how happy I am about that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman stroked his mustache, looking thoughtful.  \"...I suppose.  I don't really have any new plans...  Not to sure about this 'playing fair' nonsense.  But I do like the idea of beating Sonic at something.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMario turned to Sonic.  \"So how about it?\" he said.  \"I'm-a gonna go for it, Mr...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Sonic the Hedgehog,\" Sonic said.  After a moment's thought, he added, \"And yeah, it does sound fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm-a Mario,\" Mario said, shaking Sonic's head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRelucantly, everyone else agreed to it as well.  \t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd so it began.  Six teams were made.  Team Mushroom Kingdom.  Team Freedom Fighters.  Team Eggman Empire.  Team Koopa Troop.  Team Independent Nasties.  Team Civilian Heroes.  The latter two teams blended heroes and villains from both worlds.  The contests would last three months, with the winning team being granted wishes from a wishing star.  And to win?  Why, you simply had to have the most gold medals...</span></div></div>",

He didn't like the fact that his superspeed powers were suppressed to keep the contest fair, but he was still fast enough to get gold in most racing events.  Plus, Eggman tended to play fair, wanting to beat Sonic in fair combat.  And the events were always interesting too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOn top of that, he just liked meeting new people.  Mario and his group of friends and enemies were an interesting bunch.  There had been some tensions at first, but everyone eventually settled into the routine of the Olympics.  Today, for example, Bowser Junior, Metal Sonic, Captain Toad, and Tundra were all competing in a swimming competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t(He was silently glad to be left out of that one.  He couldn't swim, and was the only one who had to walk on the bottom with a life vest and oxygen tank.  It was humiliating.)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSonic wasn't scheduled to compete until two days from now.  Which meant he had time to sneak around and have some naughty fun.  The villainesses on both sides tended to mellow out during the games, and were a lot easier to talk to and flirt with.  Plus, Sonic was something of a ladies man.  Every married couple he knew was in an open relationship, and he had an almost complete success rate in dating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNow the question was who to visit for some fun?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t</span></div></div>",

I want to be digested in some pretty young lady's stomach and become fat for their boobs, belly, and have my remains flushed down the drain.  I am offering myself to every young woman on Mobius as food.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails wiggled his butt for the screen.  \"I'm delicious, I assure you.  And I'll wiggle in your stomach most pleasantly.  Don't worry about causing me pain, I'll take a drug that will dull my pain centers while strengthening my pleasure centers just before you eat me.\" He turned back around, and patted his tummy.  \"I mean, just look at me!  Who wouldn't want to have a plump, juicy fox like me for a meal?  And I'll be getting plumper and juicier by the time I choose a predator to gulp me down!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails grinned.  \"That's right, I'm choosing a predator.  If you want me to become your fat, to fuel your sexy body, send me a video and try to seduce me.  Show off your maw, talk about how good I'll look swelling out your tummy, how big I'll make your breasts and ass.  Don't worry, I won't post any of your videos on the internet.  They're just for my personal enjoyment.\"  He pulled up an image on the side of the screen.  \"And if you're wondering if weight gain is all you'll get out of this, the winner will also be paid ten million rings from my bank account.  And yes, this is my legit bank account.  I've got a lot of patents out there right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails thought a moment and added, \"Ladies only, please.  Despite the oddly popular theory, I assure you I am heterosexual.\"  He looked mildly ill.  \"I mean, I view Sonic as my big brother, not my butt buddy.  Geez louise.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails shook his head, and went back to smirking.  \"As for those of you who are worried about murdering me, don't be,\" he said.  \"I'm using this as a way of testing the 'extra lives' system I've invented.\"  He moved the camera over to a glowing device with ten power rings in it.  \"If it works, after I'm completely digested, I'll respawn right there.  As proof, I'll ask the lucky predator to completely record my consumption and digestion and post it to my account, with my respawning being auto-recorded and posted as well.  If it doesn't... Then my predator and a few friends will inheret all of my money and possessions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails giggled.  \"It's win-win for me either way.  If I respawn, then my 'extra lives' system works and we get an advantage in the fight against Eggman.  If not, then I go out the way I want to.  In the belly of a hot young woman,\" he said.  \"So send in those vids, ladies.  I'm sure you're hungry.\"  </span></div></div>",

All the mechanics seem functional.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And there doesn't seem to be anything wrong on the mechanical end,\" Rotor said.  \"The memory recorder is functional, the lifesign monitor is functional, the DNA sample is stored safely...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You cannot possibly think this is sane!\" Sally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Pft.

Clove the Pronghorn and her sister Cassia, the ninja lynx Conquering Storm, the pirate queen Abyss the Squid, the sleek Nephthys the Vulture, the maniacal loyalist Thunderbolt the Chinchilla, and the wicked troll witch Wendy Naugus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe played Tails video for them.  \"I want all of you to submit videos to the fox's contest,\" he ordered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You've got to be kidding,\" Storm muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"For the glory of Eggman!\" Thunderbolt declared, the others rolling their eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Are you sure this will even work, my lord?\" Nephthys said.  \"I don't mean to question you, but there is a huge element of chance involved in this.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm aware,\" Eggman said.  \"I'm not happy about this at all, but for a chance to get access to this Extra Life tech Tails is developing... It's worth it.  If you're chosen, try to get him to take you to his lab and steal the technology.  Failing that, save a portion of the 'leftovers' after you digest him.\"  The women all went a little green around the gills.  \"Yes, yes, its gross, but some of it may be tied into his DNA.  If you're that squeamish, grab some of his fur.  Or seduce him and get semen.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And if none of us are chosen?\" Nephthys persisted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Consider yourselves lucky, as due to the high element of chance in this, you won't be punished for failure,\" Eggman said, sighing.  \"I refuse to let this opportunity pass us by. As for your chances... Well, from what little I understand or care about Mobian standards of beauty, I'm reasonably certain all of you save Wendy are reasonably attractive.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWendy chuckled, misunderstanding what Eggman meant.  \"Don't feel too offended, girls, when I outclass all of you,\" the witch said, cackling in her shrill voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Actually,\" Eggman said, \"I want you to have Carrotia make a video offer instead of you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbyss, Thunderbolt, and Storm all snickered at the gobsmacked expression on Wendy's face.  \"B-But... But Eggy...\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"One, don't call me that,\" Eggman snapped.  \"Two, you're old, you're ugly, and you have a voice like nails on a chalkboard.  Have.  Carrotia.  Make the video.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOffended, Wendy made a mistake.  \"Now listen here, you-\" she started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman hovered his hand over a bright red button, one of twelve.  All the Egg Bosses froze in fear.  Wendy, sweating visibly, gulped hard.  \"...I'm sorry, Lord Eggman,\" she said.  \"I'll get Carrotia started on the video right away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman smiled, moving his hand away from the button that would trigger the failsafe in Wendy's cybernetics, and sat back in his chair.  \"I'm glad we understand each other.  Now GET TO WORK.\"  He closed the connection, and sighed.  This was a dumb plan, and there was a chance that none of them would get picked.  But he had to TRY.  \"ORBOT!  CUBOT!  Get me a lemonade!  And cookies!  The good chocolate ones with the cream filling!\" he bellowed.</span></div></div>",

Wendy muttered promises of revenge and closed off her call, leaving the other five to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well...\" Abyss said, \"This is officially the weirdest thing we've ever done.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And the third most embarrassing,\" Storm muttered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"If he wants the technology, why not simply send Phage to hack his computer and get the blueprints?\" Clove said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Bet you anything he thinks of that in a few minutes and does it anyway,\" Abyss said.  And right on cue, Eggman contacted them all, re-entering the link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh, good, most of you are still here.  Where's Wendy?\" Eggman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Gone off to sulk because you insulted her looks,\" Abyss said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman snorted.  \"She can get over it,\" he said.  \"Listen, I just thought of something - I'm going to send Phage to hack into Tails' computer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbyss had to fight the urge to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman continued.  \"She'll steal the files related to the Respawn and anything else that might be interesting.  I've upgraded her stealth capabilities recently, so she should be able to get through his defenses without being notice.  I want you lot to continue with the initial plan, though.  If we're lucky, he'll pick one of you and that will act as a distraction.  Again, no penalty for failure if you don't get picked,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And if we do?\" Storm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Call in backup and steal the device itself while you're digesting him,\" Eggman said.  \"Again, it'll be a good distraction for the Freedom Fighters.  And who knows?  You might get lucky and actually kidnap him.\"  He chuckled.  \"I have to admit, that would be a unique way of doing it.  Anyway.  Get to work.  Make a video.  Think sexy.  You want him to think your stomach is the best.\"  He paused.  \"...That felt really weird to say.\"  He broke contact again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"See?\" Abyss said, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThunderbolt snarled.  \"Enough mocking our lord!  We have been charged with seducing the fox into letting us eat him!  And I, for one, shall do my best to win his affections!\" she declared.  Then she paused, realizing what she just said.  \"For the plan.  Win his affection for the plan... SHADDUP!\" She quickly closed off the connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Imbecile,\" Storm muttered, Abyss, Clove, and Nephthys chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Anyway,\" Abyss said.  \"Lord Eggonhisface being predictable aside, we should probably make those dumb videos.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"If we must...\" Storm said.  \"My spies noticed that he tends to blush and stammer around Nicole, especially since she gained a more physical form... Perhaps if I play on the fact that we're the same species...\" She broke the connection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I cannot believe we're actually doing this.  Trying to seduce a young man into becoming our food,\" Nephthys muttered, breaking the connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Eh, different kind of plunder,\" Abyss said.  \"How about you, Clove?  Any reservations?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Several,\" Clove said, sighing.  \"But considering that I don't dare betray him because he's the only one who can help my sister, I have little choice but to be as loyal as Thunderbolt...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah, I heard that was why you joined... Gotta be a doctor who knows how to treat her somewhere, right?\" Abyss said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Encouraging rebellion?\" Clove said, a little amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbyss shrugged.  \"I got a line on short-circuiting the failsafe.  At this point I'm only staying with Eggman because he's got the best toys and can lead me to the best plunder,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tClove chuckled.  \"I wish you well on that,\" she said.  \"As for your idea...\"  She smiled sadly.  \"I went to Eggman because I had been to everyone else I could find first...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbyss cringed.  \"That's rough...  Y'know what?  I like you.  Send me data on Cassia's condition and I'll see if I came up with anything,\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Thank you,\" Clove said.  \"...We should probably delete the last part of this conversation from the records.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Heh, good point,\" Abyss said.  \"We also gotta get started on seducing a kid genius into our stomachs.\"  She frowned.  \"...Eggy's right, that is weird to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBoth women broke contact, deleting the records of the conversation from Nephthys leaving the call, and went to work.</span></div></div>",

Which was fine with him, as he wanted to enjoy this.  Truthfully, applying this to his kink was the only way he was able to get the courage to do this.  It was so dangerous... He shook his head.  Sitting back in his chair, he decided to look over the offers he'd gotten.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe briefly reflected on the fact that he put a subliminal message in the video, one that would make women actually consider eating him, to be turned on a little by the idea of swallowing him up.  He reflected on the morality of it, and shook his head.  Compromises had to be made sometime to get what you needed to do done.  Laying back in his chair, he pulled his cock out and began to slowly jack off, looking over the twelve offers he had.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge the Bat<br>\r\n\tFiona the Fox<br>\r\n\tMina the Mongoose<br>\r\n\tBlade the Shark<br>\r\n\tOpal the Jellyfish<br>\r\n\tWave the Swallow<br>\r\n\tCream the Rabbit<br>\r\n\tVanilla the Rabbit<br>\r\n\tNicolette the Weasel<br>\r\n\tHoney the Cat<br>\r\n\tWhisper the Wolf<br>\r\n\tBreezie the Hedgehog<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge, Wave, Nicolette, and Breezie didn't surprise him.  All four were very focused on money, and Rouge, while good-hearted, tended to get distracted if treasure became involved.  Fiona... he had mixed feelings about her.  He'd been in love with her robotic double at one point, and then there was that time she dated Sonic before switching to Scourge... He'd heard a rumor that she'd dumped him.  ...Meh, something for another day.  Whisper was surprising.  Even with the subliminal influence, he hadn't thought that she'd go against her fears of losing people enough to send in a video.  He was amused by the fact that some of his friends, including Cream and her mother, Mina, and Honey, had sent in videos.  He didn't know who Blade and Opal were, but the preview pictures of their videos showed that they were hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe decided to start with Rouge's.  He knew for a fact that she took someone telling her that she had a 'porn star body' as a compliment.  (Suggest she was a slut, however, and she'd make you regret it.)  He opened her video.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPorny saxophone music played as the camera showed Rouge laying on the bed, legs spread wide and masturbating, showing off her pussy.  Her other hand was fondling her massive breasts as she moaned softly.  \"Mmmm, Tails... Just thinking about how good you'd taste makes me so horny...\" she cooed.  \"I want to wrap my lips around your delicious young body...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHooooly fuck, Tails thought, jerking off harder.  She's even hotter than I realized.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge licked her lips hungrily, going on hands and knees and rubbing her trim, muscular tummy.  \"I want you so bad, Tails... I want to feel you in my tummy, swelling me out like I was pregnant...  I want to feel you wriggling away as you become a part of my body...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned at the camera, leaning over and starting to fondle her chest.  She squeezed and kneaded her immense bosom like she was giving Tails a titjob, the young genius starting to buck his hips in time with her movements as he masturbated.  Rouge was practically purring.  \"Handsome boy... You want to become a part of me, don't you?  Make my fat tits even fatter, softer, and jigglier...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe turned, showing off her shapely ass for the screen.  \"Mmm, or maybe you'd go to my booty.\"  She smacked her curvy rump, making the cheeks jiggle.  \"Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?  Making my ass even bigger...\"  She turned towards the screen.  Tails could tell by the way the ends of her mouth were twitching that she was struggling not to laugh, but he didn't care.  It was hot beyond belief.  \"I need you, Tails,\" she said, panting and moaning.  She let her mouth hang open, drool trailing off her tongue as she panted, fingers thrusting in and out of her pussy.  Tails leaned forward, gazing down her throat, seeing her gullet pulse with each breath.  \"I'm so hungry... Feed me, Tails!  Feed me!\" The video ended with Rouge clamping down around the webcam, engulfing it in darkness, and making a swallowing noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails, biting his lip, jacked himself off faster and faster until he came, shooting his seed across the room.  \"Okay... Top five so far...\" he said.  He decided to take a look at Blade's video next, since he wasn't familiar with her.  Blade herself was a shapely, athletic shark girl with a decent bust, red skin, a tight-looking rump underneath her tail, and solid abs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe video started with Blade not even on camera, the webcam on a beach focused into the water.  As Tails watched, he saw a red, black-tipped headfin heading towards the camera, Blade literally lunging out of the water with a dramatic splash, landing so that her jaws were almost engulfing the camera.  Tails's jaw dropped as he stared lustfully down her throat, past her sharp, pointed teeth, her breath fogging the webcam slightly as she panted with apparent hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm not gonna be flirty,\" Blade said in a gruff, tomboyish voice.  \"I ain't that type.  I am a <i>predator</i>.\"  She licked her lips hungrily.  \"And I want your MEAT.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails couldn't resist giggling at the unintentional innuendo.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe sat back, rubbing her bare stomach.  \"I can just imagine it.  Your taste, your body filling up mine, feeling you die behind my abs...\"  She shivered in desire.  \"Mmm, perfect fuel for me to keep hunting...\"  She grinned, showing off her teeth and making Tails shiver in lust.  \"Maybe you'll get lucky, and you'll become fat on my boobs or my ass.\"  She cupped her breasts, chuckling.  \"You'd certainly look good on them.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I know I would,\" Tails said, licking his lips lustfully as he began to jack off again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Pick me, boy,\" Blade said, fingering herself and grinning.  \"Pick Blade the Shark.  And I'll show you how a <i>REAL </i>predator hunts her prey.\"  She snapped at the screen again, laughing as the video ended.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails groaned, bringing himself to climax again.  \"Goddamn... I'm gonna need to keep hydrated if they're all this good...\" </span></div></div>",

Opal, another pirate like Blade, was as seductive as Rouge.  Fiona was another seducer, although she hurt her chances by bringing up their former relationship.  ...Still, the idea of fattening her up with his meat was oddly appealing.  Mina and Honey were cheerfully upbeat and teasing, and had a lot of mouth shots.  Nicolette and Breezie mixed seduction and business.  Nicolette's Downunda accent was appealing, while Breezie promised to make a rather attractive show of his digestion, something he could watch over and over again if it worked.  Whisper's was almost heartwarming.  Having lost many friends herself, she assured Tails that she was dedicated to his idea.  she was clearly awkward the whole recording, making the most adorable attempts at seduction.  And she did have a very sexy mawshot.  She even let herself drool a little, which turned him on even more.  Wave was straightforward, like Blade, and talked about treating Tails like the meat he was.  Cream's was oddly adorable, the way she pretended to be a fierce, hungry predator.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tVanilla's was oddly appealing.  She had a warm, motherly air about her that was an incredible turnon.  She played up her breasts, how milky Tails would make them, how she would fatten Cream up by feeding her with the milk she'd gain from eating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe had NO idea that the bunny mama was secretly a kinky MILF.  He came all over himself just watching Vanilla's video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs he watched the videos, a few more came in.  Sonar the Fennec, of the Shamar Freedom Fighters, had sent in a video, and there was a group video from the Shijin Warriors, all four girls recording their video together.  THAT was an interesting one, he was sure.  He got a video from Carrotia, one of Wendy's minions, which was surprising... Well, no, he knew that the Egg Bosses would probably make a move on his ressurection tech.  For all he knew, Phage was already in his systems... Actually, he should scan for her now.  He was distracted for this when he noticed the email address on one of his new videos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis mother's email.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Oh my gawd...\" Tails said.  The sheer naughtiness of the idea.  Vanilla was MILFy enough, but his own mother?  He had to see this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRosemary Prower sat nude on Tails' bedroom at his parents house.  His father was clearly the man behind the camera, calmly and quietly talking her through this.  Blushing, Rosemary said, \"Um... Hi honey!\"  She giggled nervously.  \"Oh gosh, why I am turned on by this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Naughty girl,\" his father, Amadeus, teased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRosemary giggled.  \"Well... Mommy has thought about this a lot since you made your rather... ah... surprising offer.  And Mommy has thought... well... who better than your own mother to be the one to eat you?  Mother's love will keep you safe, and make sure that your machine works!\"  She grinned naughtily.  \"And if it doesn't...  well, it's a perfect excuse to see if we can make you again.\"  She clearly felt guilty about saying it, but she also looked aroused at the thought of it.  She cooed, massaging her belly and her ample chest.  \"Mmmm, wouldn't it be nice to be in Mommy's tummy again?  Making her all round and huge?  Making her boobies big like you did when I was pregnant with you?\"  She licked her lips, beckoning at the camera.  She held open her jaws, letting Amadeus get a good, long shot of her throat. \"Come home to mommy, sweetie.  I'd love to taste how big a boy you've become.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails was masturbating FURIOUSLY to this one, groaning in incestuous lust.  </span></div></div>",

It was a small, black sphere, with a slight glow to it.  \"It uses those artificial Phantom Ruby shards we took from Dr. Eggman's lab to create a field that perfectly preserves whatever's meant to be stored inside it for... well, ever.  All you have to do is put the device in a storage container.  It will automatically calibrate to it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Seriously?\" Sonic asked, smiling.  \"How's that work?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That's the beauty of it.  It works by tapping into the energy of what's being stored and using it to empower the storage container and keep it running, while also keeping it from experiencing wear and tear.  The container, enhanced by the device, then produces an energy field that keeps whatever's inside it in a field of stasis that will last as long as the container does.  Which, thanks to the energy recycling, will be pretty much forever.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I think I get it,\" Sonic said, looking thoughtful for a moment.  \"Basically I put that thing in a fridge, and then I could keep a leftover chilidog in there for years, and it'd still be fresh and delicious when I pulled it out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That's actually a perfect example!\" Tails said, smiling.  \"The device would use the energy of the food items in the fridge to empower it, and generate a stasis field to keep the food fresh.  I'm working on a version that will work with stored inanimate objects.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSonic quirked an eyebrow.  \"It only works with food, then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Organics in general,\" Tails clarified.  \"The device basically recycles bioenergy in and out of something endlessly.  I've actually been working on something similar for a while, but until I added the Phantom Ruby shard, it made the stored material actually degrade in quality.  Now, though?  Perfect cycling and perfect preservation.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Neat!\" Sonic said, grinning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails smiled.  \"But that's not all - it also increases the internal storage capacity of the object by a millionfold, AND makes the entrance to the container capable of stretching to fit.\"  He grinned excitedly.  \"Think of the benefit to food banks!  To hospitals!  Heck, to waste disposal!  You could put tons of organic waste in easy storage containers and keep the land beautiful!  It wouldn't rot, sure, but that's just another project!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSonic patted his genius friend on the back.  \"Heckuva job, pal.  Why don't I treat you to a chilidog?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Can I have pizza instead?\" Tails asked, grinning sheepishly.  \"I'm kinda tired of chilidogs...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Blasphemer,\" Sonic teased.  \"Yeah, sure, we can get pizza.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Thanks, Sonic,\" Tails said, setting the device down on a tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...With chilidog sauce on it,\" Sonic added, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails laughed, and the two dashed off.  </span></div></div>",

The limber Bat knew she was close to her target now, drawing near a thick, steel door at the end of the mezzanine. She paused a little while to catch her breath, wiping sweat from her white-furred brow. Her rest was brief, however. Suddenly, a loud, sharp ping and, strangely, the sound of breaking glass denoted that a sharpshooter was nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shot had just narrowly evaded hitting her, the Bat grasping sight of a spark as metal pounded metal. \"Crap!\" Rouge growled, seeking protection behind a sturdy steel pipe, grateful for its presence as the sound of another ping validating that she was still being targeted, \"And here I all but believed this was going to be trouble-free!\" True enough, the Bat had faced little opposition on Eggman's airship thus far, his latest repeat of the Final Fortress cutting corners on the safety hallmarks. There had been the usual beats of the mad scientist's E-Series bots, but they had been easy enough for the thief to keep away from, the amalgam of her wings and spryness allowing her to slip past easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps that was why Doctor Ivan Robotnik's reasonings lately had been more practical than usual. The villain used his airship and automated army for raiding strikes against the smaller towns and villages. If he couldn't afford the conventional protection for his flying fortress, all the hits on banks and museums made a lot more sense. That cake was something the stealthy Bat had been more than eager to get a chunk of. After a little digging around, the thief had been able to find some of the engineers forced to work on Eggman's ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, he found herself in possession of its complete blueprints, including the location of the rotund tyrant's treasure room. Peeking her head out from around the pipe, the Bat grimaced and pulled back behind cover just as another shot swished by her head. She had only gotten a glance, but it was enough to know her enemy: A more particular E-Series, this bot with a much thinner body than usual, gave it an outline that was a little harder to spot from far off. Fortunately for her, she now knew its position; Unfortunately for her, it recognized hers too. This wasn't going to be like the other robots she had run into so far; there was no creeping past now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the motorized doorway were like the other ones she'd seen on this ship, it would open far too leisurely for her to slide through before being shot. She wasn't getting out of this without challenging her attacker head-on. Taking a deep breath, the Bat pulled up her thick white and pink-cuffed gloves. In one rapid movement, the batgirl extended her wings, ducked out from cover, and gripped the nearby railing with her hands before launching herself into the endless heavens beneath her. Shots continued to come after the Bat as she collapsed her wings, launching down towards the floor, each one missing just as she knew they would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven one of the good doctor's machines wouldn't have been able to hit her at this tempo, but this wasn't the tricky part again. Extending her wings again, she coasted down, and then up back around the platform the sniper was on, hoping to catch it unready as she flapped her wings to gain even more altitude. As she cleared the platform's bottom, she found herself with the high ground on her attacker. However, the bot had tracked her with skilled accuracy; its rifle placed straight at her. \"No!\" She cried out as a loud bang resounded throughout the surrounding metal beams and airship dividers, the thief having only enough time to raise her arm in a futile effort at self-defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain discharged through her arm as her eyes grew wide in dread. But the blow did not travel through and hit her in the chest as she had expected. Somehow, her instinctual, last-ditch block had worked! A quick series of clicks and whirrs drew Rouge's awareness back to her attacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge roared in rage as she dived down upon the E-Series bot, another shot echoing around them and sending the Bat's large, supersensitised ears ringing as the rifle went off beside them. The thief was unscathed this time, and there was nothing the sharpshooter could do as a swift kick to its middle, her seashell white, heart-adorned boots slamming with its metal torso with a thundering and satisfying clank. The bandit's large, teal eyes met the robot's hot magenta, yet frosty and emotionless photoreceptors as it was sent soaring off of the walkway. The assassin robot's tall body and rifle were both sent gyrating; it's pipe-like arms flailing as they hurtled down towards the Earth far below. Grinning, Rouge turned back towards where the walkway was before wincing in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down, filled with shock and relief as she finally caught sight of her injury; repose because it wasn't the bullet hole she had feared, and excitement because there was a small dart protruding out of the bare skin of her arm. She pressed her eyes shut as she pulled it out, scowling as she inspected what seemed to be a mix between a dart and a hypodermic needle. Its contents were drained, leaving the glass vial that served as the projectile's body almost empty beyond a few tiny dark, electric indigo beads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" She snarled, before stowing the dart in her generous bosom, the projectile stored safely behind her heart-shaped chest plate, \"I suppose that means whatever toxin Robotnik filled it with is already inside me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over her gash now, observing the same indigo color as the liquid subtly shading the veins around it. She hopelessly compressed her lips to it and attempted to extract the poison out, hawking some of it into the air, but realizing she was far too late to stop it all. Whatever it was, it was flowing through her now. It seems like she'd soon need to find both the treasure room and an antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying back to the catwalk, the Bat landed with a groan, banging the lever to open the unfasten and running inside as soon as the steel door disjointed open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow finding herself in a long sequence of hallways, the Bat ran through them, following the blueprints she had learned by heart as she thought more on the dart that had hit her. Undoubtedly whatever she had been injected with wasn't meant to kill her, else Robotnik would have just loaded his sneaky sniper bot with lead. Whatever it was she had been administered with, though, it didn't bode well. The doctor was up to something, and Rouge desperately hoped that she could get in and out of that vault and back on solid ground, preferably near some medical treatment, before she could find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge continued to rush through the hallways, panting and huffing as she drew ever closer to her destination. The treasure room wasn't far now, but after her confrontation with the sniper, she was eager to get this over with, mainly as her abdomen grumbled hungrily. Get the treasure, get out, sort out the venom, then a big warm dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great,\" She huffed as she came to a different door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Bat was about to estimate how to get through it, it began to open. The thief leaped to the roof, flapping her wings to give her air before she grabbed hold of a large pipe and clung to it lengthwise, hiding from sight as best as possible. A familiar series of clicking and clanking declared a stock E-100 series guard bot before it could even walk out the door. With a gun in one hand and a sack in the other, the guard bot swiveled its stout head over its chest, looking back and forth along the crisscrossing hallways, scanning them for intruders before striding down the one Rouge had entered through. After a few seconds, it disappeared around a corner, and the batgirl dropped down to the floor, slipping between the massive vault doors just as they sealed shut behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another easy break-in! Now for the master thief to - wait, what the hell is this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitation filled the thief's face as she looked around the gigantic vault, her eye spasming as she continued to process just what she was seeing. There were ledges upon ledges lining the room's walls, yet, instead of containing precious stones and gold, silver, and heaps of banknotes like the woman had hoped, the Bat instead found something else entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge found lines of candied, sugary glazed pastries, packed into each bit of available space on every single shelf - not one golden coin or sparkling emerald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. Have. Got to be kidding me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bat wasn't too jovial about this unusual situation, but that didn't mean she was coming out of this vault empty-handed. Not if her belly had anything to say about it. The pastries' scent filled the room, most of them smelling quite fresh, the emptiness that the woman felt in her stomach growing worse as she stepped further into the strange room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so not a total loss...\" The Bat chirred, a little bit of saliva spilling past her luscious pink lips as her belly growled hungrily, \"At the very least, I can grab a nibble before finding the real prize here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill salivating, the voluptuous thief stumbled forwards, her hips swaying beneath her black, skintight catsuit as her hunger drug her feet forwards.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A sole, harsh whistle blared, a small but jarring trumpet of din from the overhead speakers before the door controls to the vault was sealed away beneath thick, steel plating. A blast door lowered over the already heavily protected doorway to ensure that there was no possible way of cutting through. \"Chaos! Stupid!\" Rouge growled, grinding her teeth as she recalled Prison Island. She had made a similar error during a break-in there and desired to learn from it, only for her to blunder even worse now, \"I should have been more careful...\" She sighed, moaned the saliva from her lips with a gloved hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By all means, I'd say you should have!\" A voice gloated exultantly from the loudspeakers, none other than Doctor Ivan \"Eggman\" Robotnik himself, \"Prowling around, as usual, I see Rouge!\" He laughed, \"My, my! How graceless of you, though, confined like the rat with wings you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! You just got lucky is all...\" Rogue huffed, meandering over to one of the shelving on the wall and picking up a cream horn shakily, turning it over in her hand as her flat stomach began to roar once more, \"By the way, nice vault you've got here tubby! Is your hoard locked up somewhere else, or are you so much of a fatass that you genuinely consider this junk food 'treasure'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman only laughed once again before answering her, \"Oh, you must be calling attention to those blueprints I entitled to fall into your chiropterous little paws! Of course, I wouldn't be so lax in letting something crucial to my enterprise out of my sight! Speaking of 'lax,' it looks like you took the bait to my little trap, lock, stock, and sniper...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dart...\" Rouge gasped between gritted teeth as her belly roared again, saliva once more trickling past her lips. \"I thought this was too fucking easy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerking the dart out from its spot within her cleavage, Rouge looked it over once more, scowling as Robotnik continued, \"Looks like you get it now, but far too late I'm afraid. You see, my vexing little Bat, the solution now flowing through your veins, is a special blend of my design! A serum for manipulating metabolism, increasing the hunger to the point of crippling desire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Rouge groaned, dropping the dart and grasping at her abdomen as it seized in painful, starving hunger, sweat trickling from her temples as the ampoule exploded against the tile flooring, \"You crafty son of a bitch... Then the pastries...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are all yours!\" Robotnik cackled madly, reveling in his plan unfolding, all part of it coming into play to trap Rouge just how he had formulated, \"You have been a bothersome bone in my throat for far too long, my little bandit! I had a suspicion you'd stick your batty nose into my ventures once I began to assemble resources, so I decided I would identify your strengths and crush them all at once. Your speed, your spryness, your flight! All of them will be null and void when I'm done with you. Or should I say, when you're through with your meal! You see, appetite isn't the only thing my lovely little potion magnifies! It also quickens digestion, and ensures that even more of what you eat is converted into blundering, burdensome fat! I was hoping you would be hit with quite a few of those darts, but I'm sure one will be more than enough to turn you into a complete cow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scream bolted from the batgirl's lips, the thief throwing the cream horn to the ground and shattering it into a profusion of crumbs as she stomped it apart in anger. Yet she doubled over once more, her belly roaring in hunger now as she winced and whined, \"No! You can't do this to me you oval-shaped monster; I'll find a way out of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure, you will! Go ahead and try, you irksome rat with wings! I'm sure you'll find it very hard to think of an escape plan as your stupid little animal brain packs to the brim with esurient hunger!\" He laughed, \"Why not just help yourself in the meantime!? You've come all this way to discover this vault, and here you are! I'm sure you'd rather it go to your waist instead of waste anyways. Hehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fat son of a bitch..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ironic choice of words! Ahahah! Bon' appetite, Rouge!\" And with that, the loudspeaker shrilled before cutting out, leaving the imprisoned bandit with only the endless growling of her stomach for company. Rouge reached for the nearest confection, a bear claw, and took a bite. She told herself she would only try a couple of fig rolls at the most, maybe even an eclair, just enough to stop the pain in her belly, to content that tormenting hunger. However, Rouge the Bat had found herself eating dozens of strudels before she could even pause long enough to register what she had done. She gulped and whined as she looked down at the crumbs spilling over her chin and cleavage, and to the bulging pot-belly beyond them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to stop...\" She huffed past a mouthful of baked sweets, even as she continued to shove the rest of the pastries she held into her salivating mouth. But she didn't stop. Instead, she cleaned out an entire shelf's worth of sweet bread. And then moved onto the next, and then the next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shelves were emptied one by one, and leisurely but unabatedly, Rouge's belly continued to swell before the Bat's panicked eyes. Before long, the rest of her began to bloat as well, just as Eggman had implied. The batgirl's now round belly churned as it digested the fattening treats fed to it, dutifully turning every bite into thick, soft adipose tissue upon the once thin Bat's frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach bite devoured seemed to be making her meatier, bringing her just a little bit closer towards obesity. Rouge wanted to stop, but she couldn't. The once thin but well-endowed bandit was slowly ballooning, and there was nothing she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell-muscled legs once used to hauling hoards of treasure softened into thick, blubbery thunder thighs. A belly that could slip past trip wires to allow the Bat to claim her well-guarded prizes distended with food, and then sagged with fat as it bulged against her skintight jumpsuit, folding over into dense, thick rolls of fat that caused the material to creak unnervingly. Rouge's rear end did little to help her beleaguered outfit. The incredibly tight, though gratefully pliable catsuit left little to the imagination as her posterior swelled, her blubbery cheeks bulging and drawing the rubbery material deep between her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge's pink chest-plate began to creak too, her bosom, already quite sizeable, left uncovered to catch both adversary and ally alike off their guard, cascading forwards as her tits swelled to even more obscene sizes. Even Rouge's face wasn't spared from her rapidly expanding weight, her cheeks cushioning as the once sharp features of her skull was lost in plush flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed. Thousands of sweets were devoured. Hundreds of pounds were gained, turning the lithe bandit into a heavy-footed colossus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still, her belly continued to growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohoho!\" Eggman cackled ardently to himself, hands clutched behind his back as the red-suited scientist strutted proudly down the hallway. His stomach preceded him as he walked, the villain between two specialized, especially brawny E-Series sentinels equipped with machine guns. The demented genius came to a stop as he entered the vault, stopping to gaze at his handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge the Bat lay there, leaning back indolently on the floor, one plump hand holding up her head as the other plucked apple strudels one by one from a small, dwindling pile next to her and plopped them past her drool-drenched lips. The batgirl, now doubtlessly fat, looked up at Eggman with half-lidded eyes. She chewed and swallowed the latest morsel of thousands that had filled her stomach, before letting loose a tremendous burp, sending drool gliding from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well!\" Eggman cackled to himself, grinning from ear to ear, \"If it isn't Rouge the Fat! It would certainly appear that my concoction is more than effective, but how does my newest test subject feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rotund bandit grunted as she licked her lips free of crumbs, only to dirty them again as she shoved another strudel into her maw, \"Starving,\" She muttered past a mouthful of food, \"Seems as it's going to take more than a room filled with food to finish me off, fatass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman laughed in mirth as he looked the flabby Bat over, \"First of all, let's not call the kettle black, now shall we?\" He mused, materializing a portable clicker from behind his back, \"Second, you are my prisoner now, but I am not without cordiality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThumbing one of the toggles on the clicker, some steel panels around the room retracted from the floor, concealing furniture that now rose from compartments beneath the vault. A bed with a narrow mattress and no blankets, a washbasin, and a looking-glass rose into view. Each piece of furniture was simplistic and austere, yet all of them were enormous, plainly made for somebody even bigger than Rouge was at this point. The embellishments of a jail cell meant to serve the needs of the world's fattest prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may find them a little awkward at first, but I assure you, my dear, you will grow to appreciate them! In more ways than one...\" He chuckled with delight, \"As for food, I will make sure that my robot servants restock the entire room! Constantly. Rather kind of me to host my plump guest in a room, don't you agree, especially after all the trouble you and your friends have put me through over the years! I assure you, my tubby thief, despite what you may be experiencing, you will never go hungry ever again...\"</span></div></div>",

However, I'm going to require a helping hand, or paw, in carrying out the rest of my plot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat bat scowled at him, smacking her lips as she ate, \"Yeah, well fat chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortunately for me...\" Robotnik continued, pulling a polaroid camera from one of his coat's pockets, \"It does not require us working together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Photoshoot, huh? Cute.\" Rouge chirred erotically, sticking her fat breasts out. Each tit threatened to spill out of her tight catsuit as she shoveled the remaining five strudels off the ground, placing each one onto her thick, sausage-like fingers and grinning alluringly at the crazed scientist. \"Tell me, Eggy, how do I look?\" Eggman snapped the photo, filling the already brightly-lit vault with a flash as the picture printed out onto a compact card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing it, Eggman shook the image, laughing as he looked it over, \"Marvelous! I'm sure it will be an outstanding enticement for your mettlesome little playmates. Especially that ballsy red echidna chum you like to hang around with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm reddening unrolled across Rouge's fat cheeks as she thought of Knuckles seeing her body like this, but she tightened her eyes. A serene smile split her chubby face as she glowered at her captor, \"And I'm sure it will make a splendid memento for when I escape and teal everything you own, you bag of shit!\" She smugly smiled, plopping the rest of the strudels into her mouth gladly as her plump belly growled loudly, \"It will give me something to remember your crazy plan by once I escape and lose all of this weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor's smile dropped somewhat, but he let out an amused chuckle, \"I know you will do your best to get out of here. However, I'm afraid you'll find with all that lard weighing you down now, your best isn't what it used to be!\" He smirked, handing the camera and photograph off to his mechanical sentinels before stepping backward along with them over the threshold of the vault door as it and the blast doors began to seal shut slowly. \"However, if you want to get out of here, I propose you do it posthaste... Your next meal arrives in an hour. You may not be too fat to annoy me just yet, but just wait until you've had your second course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Eggman walked off as the doors fastened shut behind him, leaving Rouge alone with the roaring of her belly and a room now utterly devoid of food. Shifting her now over 300-pound body off the ground, Rouge tried not to think about the pain, slowly filling her far more giant belly once again, looking around the room for something that would be of use to get her out of here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Ivan Robotnik had done it; he had successfully captured Rouge the Bat. Well, for now, anyway. Catching the blue rodent and his friends wasn't ever too tricky; it was getting them to stay put that was a challenge. The blue needle-mouse alone had more energy inside him than your average nuclear reactor, and the rodents together were off the charts, so keeping some of that hyperactivity inside a cage proved frustrating. Even with his plan of weighing that energy down with dense fat, there was an annoying whisper at the back of his head telling him it might not be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman had been watching the bat try to squirm her way out of the vault for ten minutes. This was perfect; the weight gain may not be enough to turn the bat into a helpless blob, but he had a back-up plan. Until the next shipment of fattening snacks enter her cell in under an hour, he could finally test out something new he had just been dying to show the rat with wings. They were reliable, Sonic, and his entourage, but they weren't quite so powerful without the blue blur to back them up, were they? He looked again at the monitor showing Rouge's cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat seemed to have given up on trying to escape, at least for now. Still, her eyes were darting around the room, probably looking for something that could help her leave. But Rouge would find not a single thing out of place. Eggman had been preparing this for months, and he wasn't going to ruin his plan by being careless. \"Sir?\" A slightly robotic voice drew him out of his inner monologue, and he looked to his side to see Orbot floating attentively. \"Everything is for your presentation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman gave a sinister smile to the monitor before cracking his knuckles. \"Perfect. Begin the simulation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was having a bad day, and that was an understatement. It was bad enough that Eggface had kidnapped her. It was humbling at the very least for her to put on hundreds of pounds of adipose tissue thanks to the doctor's dart. But all that she could think about, aside from escape, is Robotnik waving around that photo to Knuckles, Shadow, or anyone else she cared about. The added heft to her frame wasn't so hard to get used to, and she appreciated that most of that fat congregated to her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the thought of her friends seeing her like this was just something that made her skin crawl. She had spent years cultivating her persona as a seductive, sultry, treasure thief; she didn't need people thinking about her like she was some prized hog at the state fair. The cherry on top of her predicament? The most realistic scenario she can think of in which she escapes from Eggman's clutches...is if her friends save her. Playing the role as the damsel in distress was never high on her checklist, and right now, it was at rock bottom.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNow she was stuck in a stupid dreary cell with an empty stomach. She had nothing better to do for the next hour when the next shipment of food comes. She could wait, right? Of course, she could, she's Rouge the Bat, dammit! This would be easy, just sit still and wait for rescue/food; she can do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about five seconds for the bandit to get bored out of her mind when she wasn't eating or thinking about escaping. She tapped her heart-adorned boots on the vault's floor, sounding much more audible thanks to the extra weight she put on. How long had she been here? Her guess would be somewhere between an hour and eternity. What was taking that damn doctor so long?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Eggman! Quit playing with your mustache and hurry it up! Your favorite prisoner is hungry!\" She shouted, only half expecting a response. A few seconds passed, and nothing. She continued to tap her foot, as though the heavy tapping noise would somehow move the time. She spotted the camera near the northwest corner of the vault's ceiling and glared at it. \"Come on! It's got to have been an hour by now! Is this really how you treat your guests?!\" She whined; if she were going to put up with this, she would make sure that Eggman had to listen to her complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this finally seemed to catch his attention as there was a crackling noise of an intercom turning on. \"It's been twelve minutes, Rodent!\" Spat the doctor. Rouge just smirked, having irritated him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sorry, Eggface, but every second in here feels like an hour!\" She grinned. The bat could hear more annoyed grumbling from the intercom, probably giving an order to one of his robots. \"Hey, since I have your attention, I never get why you always call me a rodent. I guess it's because you think of all of us as 'pests', but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My definition of rodent is someone who always annoys me and should end up as roadkill on the side of a highway,\" the human interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge subtly finches at the visual \"...ouch.\" But soon, a grin took over her chubby face. \"Going by that, I am free to call you a rodent as well.\" Eggman honestly wasn't surprised the thief responded the way she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No, because I'm not a dirty aminal-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are a stinky human, and that counts, right?\" Rouge jeeringly waved a hand under her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man saw red. \"I do not stink! But since you're so determined to be a thorn in my side, I have good news; your waiting is done!\" Eggman started doing a cartoonishly evil laugh, that made Rouge want to roll his eyes more than anything, \"I've just got to\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, to Rouge's surprise, the whole airship lurched to the side, making her lose her footing. Ungracefully, she fell to the cold metal floor, her plumpened posterior cushioning her fall, before sliding to one of her cell's walls. \"Damn it! Not now! I haven't even used the bait, yet! How did-\" The intercom cut off before Rouge could hear more, but her ears perked up. Was that them already? Her question was quickly answered when the blast door to the vault started denting and shaking, and finally flying off to reveal Amy with her Piko Piko hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Pink!\" Rouge grinned before a soft blush spread to her cheeks. \"Not the way I'd like you to see me, but better you then Shads or Knuckles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please,\" the pink hedgie rolled her eyes, \"Those two idiots will fall for you no matter how you look.\" She complained, smashing a robot that had followed her in. Before she could counter or reply, Tails flew in, his face immediately lighting up upon seeing the now 300 lb bat.</span></div></div>",

It's controller, one Dr. Eggman, could be seen pressing every button he could in some attempt to turn the device back on. But it was simply no use as he and his contraption vanished beyond the horizon, leaving the small group of Sonic and his pals alone in the broken lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze brushed her coat, removing a few metal shavings from the cloth. \"Good riddance. Again. Honestly Sonic, does Eggman attack you so often?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess turned to the blue hedgehog, who was streching as if he had gone through a mere workout rather than saving the day. \"Yeah, you get used to it. That Egghead just doesn't know when to give up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze stepped through the debris of the Dr's latest failure, though what that failure was could be debated. Tails, was standing over by a stack of large, open containers holding some kind of green gel. His tails twirled in curiosity as he held a scanner to a leaking barrel. \"I'm not sure he even knew what he was doing.\" The young fox said. \"Whatever this compound is, it doesn't seem to have any energized properties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze had to admit, she was having trouble seeing what the doctor's plans were herself. She wasn't as scientifically inclined as Sonic's friend, but there were hardly any robots guarding the lab. In thought, Blaze turned back to Sonic. The self-proclaimed Blue Blur was talking to Amy, Rouge and Kunckles, patting them all on the back for a job well done. It was almost amusing, for all of his faults, Sonic truly was a hero. Selfless and certainly there for those he cared about. And look where that got him, loads of friends or at least rivals who respected him. All those years Blaze had spent alone and where did that get her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze's ears flicked as a groaning scratch sounded. Blaze turned back to the poorly balanced barrels Tails was examining, the pile was starting to rip. Being closer to Tails, Blaze rushed towards the fox. Her desire to protect her friend sparked her powers as a flame formed around her. She pushed Tails to the side as the barrels began to topple. Her fear of her own damage increased the heat of her flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gel touched her flame, the red surrounding Blaze turned purple. Before Tails could pull himself up and say anything, she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if she was weightless. Blaze found herself floating through a swirling vortex of pink and purple, falling and yet feeling like she was going nowhere. The time passed, Blaze could make out something coming at her. As the figure came closer, Blaze couldn't believe her eyes. It was difficult to see much of the details, but she was too certain that what she was seeing before her was herself. The being in front of her looked so much like her, her face, colors and everything. But this Blaze was wearing a far more regal outfit, purple lipstick adorning her lips and was glaring at her with a cold look. Not the kind of cold that comes from pushing away people, but the kind of cold that came from a dark heart. The two Blaze's floated beside one another for a minute, neither knowing what to say to the other before both were pulled past each other. Blaze watched as the figure vanished, wondering just what she had gotten herself into.</span></div></div>",

Of course, she was not literally his biggest fan, but as the oxymoron suggests she was the most obsessed one. Amy had constant daydreams and the kind you get sleeping at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout her and her beloved hero getting married. However, the pink fanatic had one problem that was delaying that dream goal of hers\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost every day, Amy would find herself in the same tiring routine, where the young girl would chase after her hero everywhere; and Sonic would either flee or make up some excuse to leave. Nothing was changing. History was sort of a song on repeat. But despite these setbacks, Amy refused to give up as the pink wonder was determined to make her hero entirely hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd today, she may have found that solution\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile out doing some shopping for her place, Amy unexpectedly came across her hero outside of the store, where he was reading a magazine in his hands. The pink hedgehog almost unleashed a cheerful squeal before covering her mouth; not wanting to blow this opportunity. However, just before she could make her move, Sonic in a second boosted off! Creating an enormous gust of wind that almost blew Amy away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the wind cleared, Amy unfettered a defeated sigh before suddenly getting her face smacked by the magazine Sonic was reading earlier. Peeling the book of her face, Amy, out of curiosity wondered what Sonic was even reading or looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping through the pages, it looked like any other leisure magazine, until Amy came across an interesting double-page, where the young girl\u2019s eyes were soon met with something she had never considered. Just the mere sight of it almost made her eyes jump out from their sockets from what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSonic... likes them big?\u201d Amy murmured in surprise, the two pages in front of her showing exceedingly large women all dressed in skimpy clothes and alluring lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinching her flat stomach, Amy\u2019s dumbfounded expression into a confident smirk. \u201cWell then, if he wants the fattest around...\u201d Closing the magazine in her hands and stuffing it into her shopping bag. \u201cThen I got some work to do...\u201d </div></span></div></div>",

You didn't have special powers, but you did have a Burst Wispon, and a partner Wisp you named Flare.  You didn't understand the language the Wisp spoke, but Flare seemed to like the name it was given.  As tiem went on, you gained more confidence, and more Wispon weapons, using a miniaturization holster around your chest designed by Tails to hold them all.  You also had a grappler which allowed you to swing around for mobility.  It took building up some arm strength for it not to hurt while swinging, but by the end of things, you were a confident, brave hero which couldn't be stopped.  Infinite fell to you, and while you needed the help of two Sonics to do it, you beat one of Eggman's most dangerous robots, earning the respect of the entire Resistance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNow, you worked alongside the Restoration to clear out the last remaining bits of Eggman's Empire, fighting against Egg Bosses and robots to reclaim Eggman's territory. </span></div></div>",

AoStH version - Breezie finds herself starting to have organic cravings.  What can satisfy her hunger?  If anything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Archie version - Breezie hosts a new reality show.

As his vision cleared, he noticed his fellow Freedom Fighters all around him.  Sally, Antoine, Bunnie, Nicole, Rotor, Tails, and Amy were all picking themselves up.  Nicole chuckled weakly.  \"I picked a terrible time to test my prototype new body,\" she said, the lynx hugging Sally.  To Sonic's surprise, Shadow and Rouge were there as well, along with Vector and Espio of the Chaotix, Knuckles, Tangle, and Whisper.  Antoine's sword was missing, as was Amy's hammer.  Whisper had been stripped of her Wispon multi-tool and mask, and was looking around frantically for them, Tangle doing her best to comfort her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Everyone okay?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No, Sonic,\" Shadow said irritably.  \"We've all been kidnapped, probably by Dr. Eggman.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What's the last thing everyone remembers?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"A bright red flash...\" Knuckles said, frowning.  \"You don't suppose it could be Infinite again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're half-right,\" said a voice, Sonic groaning in frustration.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh no...\" Sonic said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Nice to see you too,\" Breezie said, her silhouetted form coming on the only viewscreen in the room.  Everyone in the room glared up at their captor, the green hedgehog also the ruler of Casinopolis and the greatest media power in all of Mobius.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What do you want, Breezie?\" Sally demanded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I want you to participate in my new show,\" Breezie said, only her eyes visible in the shadows that filled her office.  \"But considering WHAT my new show is, I figured you'd need... persuasion.  So I tracked down Infinite and extracted the power of the Phantom Ruby from him.  Its all at MY command now.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well, that's not good,\" Bunnie understanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No kidding,\" Tails said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"If you're worried about your stuff, don't worry,\" Breezie said.  \"You'll get it back for the show.  I just wanted to make sure you were all aware of WHO IS IN CHARGE.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"For now,\" Shadow growled.  Breezie just chuckled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So, what, are we competing against each other?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Sometimes,\" Breezie said.  \"Mostly, you'll be competing against your co-stars.\"  She gestured to a wall, which retracted to reveal a glass panel.  Everyone's heart sank as they saw who was on the other side of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman's Egg Bosses.  The elegant Clove and her sister Cassia.  The vicious Akhlut.  The graceful Nephthys.  The cunning Lord Hood.  The pirate queen Abyss.  The brutal Tundra.  The deadly Conquering Storm.  Ruler of the roads Axel.  The mad Eggman-loyalist Thunderbolt.  The mysterious Maw.  The mighty kukku Battlelord.  And the troll witch Wendy Naugus.  In addition, Eggman's newly recruited assistant, Dr. Starline, and the technomage Regina Ferrum and sometimes Eggman ally were there as well.  They were glaring at the Freedom Fighters in a mix of curiosity and fury.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You should have seen Eggman's face when I defeated and captured all of his minions at once,\" Breezie said, grinning at the memory.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well, this is gonna be fun,\" Knuckles said, smirking.  \"Always wanted to bust up all of these guys at once.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh, it's not gonna be like that,\" Breezie said.  \"You see, the show's format is...\" </span></div></div>",

Her name was Clove, and she was a cyborg, an Egg Boss of the Eggman Empire.  She only reluctantly served her lord, as her sister Cassia had a health condition that only Eggman could keep at bay.  But as Eggman was a scientist rather than a physician, he could ONLY keep it at bay and not cure it.  She kept this fact from Cassia, not wanting to steal her sister's hope.  She, like all Egg Bosses, wore a variant of Eggman's clothing, her pants black and her coat gray with white highlights and gold, square-shaped buttons.  Her boots had gold trim, lining the shape of her hooved feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe walked through the abandoned mine shaft, ready to trigger her staff's energy scythe at a moment's notice.  Around her, four Motobug badniks and two Egg Pawns, their glowing eyes acting as flashlights, acted as her bodyguards, the Egg Pawns carrying energy rifles.  Things had been going wrong at the mine shaft, hindering the investigation into a possible well of magical Golden Rings.  Equipment failures, up to and including explosions, were happening at random with no known cause.  Knowing that Eggman would get grumpy and possibly punish her if a potential source of power was lost, she decided to lead an investigation into the mine, having the Motobugs record everything and broadcast it back to the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer younger sister, Cassia, didn't want her to go alone.  But Clove had refused to risk any of her troops, and had gone in with only Badniks for backup.  She would do whatever it took to protect her sister.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Scan for any anomolies.  Report immediately if mechanical failure starts to occur,\" Clove ordered.  The robots all confirmed the order as they moved deeper and deeper into the facility.  Clove didn't like how quiet things were.  It made her nervous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEventually, they came to a blockade, stones collapsed along the path.  She frowned, and ordered the Egg Pawns to stand back.  She began to examine the fallen rocks, trusting in her cybernetically enhanced speed and agility to get her out of danger should something go wrong.  As she examined the rocks, she noticed something.  A strange light pulsing at the back of a tiny hole.  She peered in close, trying to get a better look at it.  \"It looks almost like Dark Ga-\" she stopped when she recognized what she was about to say.  She realized her mistake moments too late, and was about to call in one of the Egg Pawns to look at it in her place, when a burst of purple smoke shot out.  Before she could stop herself, she inhaled it, coughing and wheezing.  She clutched at her throat, desperately gasping for breath, coughing up blood as her vision went black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she woke up, her uniform was in tatters.  The robots and the Mobini powering them were all ripped to shreds, and Clove could taste blood in her mouth.  Frightened, she found her staff and used the energy scythe's light to guide her out of the cave as fast as possible.  She had to get back to base.  She needed to figure out what happened, why her clothes and her robotic minions were destroyed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe told herself over and over again that the Mobini didn't have bite marks in them.  That the blood in her mouth was her own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe almost believed it.</span></div></div>",

Oh.  That thing,\" he said.  Nearby, the cybernetic echidna warlord, Lien-Da snickered.  Eggman sighed.  \"That is a repository of all my... sillier ideas.  I kept them to remind myself not to make them again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Sillier than Scratch, Grounder, and Coconuts?\" Dr. Starline asked, clearly baffled by the concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Still can't believe Breezie was able to find use for those losers...\" Eggman muttered.  \"Anyway.  They're reasonably effective weapons, but what they do is just so ridiculous... I couldn't bring myself to actually use them...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Conisdering your aversion to simple pragmatism, I'm surprised you didn't,\" Dr. Starline said, Lien-Da taking a very large step away from him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEggman snorted.  \"You're lucky you're damn useful...\" he muttered.  \"The reason I didn't use them is that doing so would humiliate me as much as it would Sonic and his friends.  If you want to play with the stupid things, be my guest.  Passcode is H4t3th4th3dg3h0g.  I'm going to see if I can give Orbot and Cubot combat capability.  Getting tired of them not doing much around here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that, Eggman stomped off, the Silly Vault opening up.  Lien-Da walked up to Starline, impressed.  \"He didn't vaporize you for backsassing him.  That's new...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Unlike you and your mercenary 'Dark Legion,'\" Dr. Starline said, ignoring the glare Lien-Da gave him, \"I prove my worth to our dear delightful lunatic every day.\"  He entered the passcode, the vault door opening and revealing several blasters that, indeed, looked quite silly.  Lien-Da, curious, looked in the vault as well... and stared right alongside Dr. Starline, struggling to process what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Are we looking at Dr. Eggman's fetishes right now?\" Lien-Da asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No, the Doctor is completely asexual,\" Dr. Starline said.  When Lien-Da gave him an inquiring look, he said, \"One of his lower minions attempted to sexually accoust Vanilla the Rabbit when we held her prisoner one time.  Eggman yelled at him, claiming that 'sex is disgusting, and if you want to act like an animal, don't do it in my base.'\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And then he killed him,\" Lien-Da surmised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And then he killed him,\" Dr. Starline confirmed, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well, at least I never have to worry about getting raped by the big fat bastard...\" Lien-Da muttered as she and Dr. Starline walked into the vault, looking over the various weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Rape, I think, is the least of your worries when dealing with Dr. Eggman...\" Dr. Starline muttered.  \"...Oh dear.  I can see why this one would be bothersome to the Doctor's dignity.\"  He paused in front of a device filled with a yellow liquid.  It resembled a dart gun with rapid fire syringe projectiles that were filled with the foul-looking yellow liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLien-Da leaned in, reading the label underneath the gun.  \"The Fattener.  Any Mobian struck with these dart projectiles will become impossibly, incredibly fat and gain a tremendous appetite, wanting to do little more than eat and sleep and attempt to fuck.  The effects of the formula also spread, turning other Mobians into gluttons, their bodies processing everything they eat into fat, leaving no bodily waste,\" she read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDr. Starline frowned.  \"Actually, that sounds rather effective,\" he said.  \"Why not use it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What would you do with the affected afterwards?\" Lien-Da asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDr. Starline thought a moment, and shrugged.  \"Hmm, point taken...\" he said.  Although he began to think of ways to impliment it effectively... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two moved on, coming across a gun covered in glitter, looking like a disco ball with a gun stock attached to it.  \"...The Bimboizer,\" Dr. Starline read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh hell the fuck no,\" Lien-Da said, scowling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDr. Starline smirked, reading the text underneath the weapon.  \"Affects both male and female Mobians, turning males into females before the primary effects occur.  Any female affected by this gun's rays will become large breasted and curvaceous bodies, as well as decreased intelligence and a greatly increased sex drive.\"  He turned towards Lien-Da, eyebrow quirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLien-Da glared back.  \"Say it and you die,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDr. Starline snickered and moved on.  The two of them walked through the lab, looking through the various odd experiments, until another caught Dr. Starline and Lien-Da's attention.  \"The Transformicron - A device that can transform any living Mobian back and forth from an inanimate object,\" Lien-Da read.  \"Wait, this could actually be a powerful weapon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Read on,\" Dr. Starline said.  \"'Discarded because the only thing it turned people into was female-shaped sex toys.'\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLien-Da huffed.  \"Well, that sucks,\" she said, walking off.  Dr. Starline just looked over the device thoughtfully, ideas formulating in his head...</span></div></div>",

He found where the barrel was through careful examination, the barrel popping out and the gun activating, making a glittery noise.  \"Very intersting...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLien-Da paused.  There was an unravelling sound, Dr. Starline glancing over and seeing that Lien-Da had unfurled her whip.  \"...You'd better not be doing what is it I think you're doing,\" she said in a low, dangerous tone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDr. Starline grinned wickedly.  \"And what is it you think I'm doing?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I think you're playing with one of the doctor's dangerous toys,\" Lien-Da said.

No, I don't think that's what's happening.  All I'm doing is conducting a little scientific experiment,\" he said, taking aim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I DON'T THINK SO!\" Lien-Da said, lashing out with her electrified whip.  Dr. Starline, anticipating this, teleported out of the way, dropping through a portal and reappearing in front of her.  But Lien-Da moved surprisingly fast, lashing out with a kick that forced Dr. Starline to teleport again.  Dr. Starline reappeared far away, firing, but Lien-Da dodged out of the way, lashing her whip towards him again, sending a blade of electricity towards him.  He portaled out of the way again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You won't get in the way of SCIENCE!\" Dr. Starline said, laughing wickedly.  His hand was aching from using the Warp Topaz over and over so quickly, but he wasn't about to lose this fight.  Especially since Lien-Da was likely to use the weapon against him should he fail.  </span></div></div>",

The orange-furred bobcat sneered as he surfed the web, gauging the importance of a series by how much porn it had.  And so far, in his poor judgement, he had decided that the Sonic franchise was the most popular in the world.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I don't get it,\" he muttered.  \"People complain about their games, especially the myuwer ones, all the time!  And yet they're just so damn popular!\"  He huffed, glaring at Sonic.  \"I'm cool!  I have cattitude!  Heck, I sling puns all the time!  I got two puns in that rant I said just nyow!\"  He shook his head.  \"I friggin' hate that hedgehog.  How could he pawsibly be more stylish than me?  Hedgehogs don't run fast!  They're adorable little spike balls!\"  He failed to recognize that his ability to float through the air was an ability regular bobcats didn't have.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe paced around.  He'd finally gotten a revival, but his games didn't do that good.  (They did worlds better than his first games, mind you, but it wasn't enough for the fame-starved bobcat.)  \"...It's gotta be Sonic's fault,\" Bubsy misjudged.  \"He's stealing my fanbase!\"  He made his decision.  \"I'm gonna make them pay!  I'm gonna...\" </span></div></div>",
