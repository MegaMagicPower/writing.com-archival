            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It all started on my first day of high school. I got out of bed after mom yelled for me to get up about nine times then staggered into the bathroom and took my shower. It was the same old routine, just going to a new school. I was always usually the first to get up but, for some reason, I had a difficult time waking up that morning. The hot water of the shower helped but I could not shake how tired I felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon, you better get going or you're going to be late!\" yelled my mom from the living room. \"Katie has already left and I have to get Sam to the bus stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming, mom!\" I called, hurrying. \"Just a second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy older sister, Katie, was nineteen and just starting college, she had already left for the week. My younger brother, Sam, got bused to school as it was five miles away. As for me, I didn't get any busing as my new school was only about two miles away from our house, it sucked to have to walk but what could I do, I was running late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming!\" I called again, running down the stairs. \"I'll grab a bite to eat at the cafeteria before home room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better, young man.\" scolded mom. \"If you look this pale when you get home, you are going to the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom worked as a doctor at the local hospital so she had little time to get me and my siblings going. She nearly kept me home as I was looking pale the night before but it was my first day, I wanted to go. I gave mom a quick kiss and ran out the door as she yelled out, \"Don't take the short cut through the woods, you hear me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah!\" I replied, running off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before I realized just how late I actually was and decided to take the shortcut through the dense woods. Mom had told me, when I was a lot younger, that there were reports of strange going ons in the dense woods between my house and the new high school and there were many protests about building the school on the far edge of it. I never really believed the wild tales of screams in the night and mysterious moaning during the day. Still, I kept my guard up anyway, just in case, as the woods were as dark as night inside. I thought I was ready for anything, having heard all of the stories a thousand times, but I was not ready for the ground beneath me to suddenly give way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" I screamed, falling in. As I fell further and further, I knew I was in trouble. \"Oh, Shi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hit the ground and blacked out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up in what seemed like hours later, I found myself...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As I glanced around me I saw I was in a room by myself, the blinds pulled down to hide most of the sun. I lay in one of those high rise beds with rails on either side so I couldn't fall out. I had a bedside table to my left and to my right there was one of those trolleys that hovered over your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, a nurse opened my door and walked in, a smile on her face. \"Hi Jon,\" she grinned. \"You're looking a little better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" I asked, my voice was croaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're still trying to figure that out ourselves,\" she told me. She picked up my chart from the bottom of the bed and began to flip through it. \"You seemed to have a fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I fell okay now, can I go home?\" I wasn't lying. I did feel much better and didn't see the point being cooped up in bed. Besides, I was missing my first day at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry hon, not yet,\" she shook her head. \"We're doing a few tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tests, what for?\" I asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're looking awfully pale. We're worried you might be suffering from anaemia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t take much longer and your mum is on her way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to take some blood before she gets here, that okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d I held out my arm for her, exposing my vein. She took the blood and left me alone once more. The silence in the room was deafening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later my mum walked through the door, her eyes misting up as soon as she saw me. She rushed to my bed, smothering me with cuddles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my boy,\u201d she stroked my hair, pushing it back from my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMum stop fussing,\u201d I snapped pushing her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI fell,\u201d I told her. \u201cThey\u2019re just doing some blood tests to make sure I\u2019m okay before I can go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue the nurse walked back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have some bad news\u2026.\u201d She began.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was tall, moderate build, with black hair and green eyes. He took the chart from the nurse and quietly excused her from the room before turning to me and mum. \"I am doctor Khan, the leading expert in transmutations in this area.\" he said. \"I'm afraid I have some grave news to tell you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMum and I exchanged a startled look before turning to Khan. \"Please, what's wrong with my son!?\" demanded mum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The woods that your son had entered was deemed forbidden for good reason.\" replied Khan. \"It is the sight of an illegal dumping ground for a research company whose workers had all vanished ten years ago.\" he swallowed hard, throwing me a look of pity. \"I'm terribly sorry, Jon but you are mutating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mu-Mutating!?\" I asked, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Into what, exactly!?\" demanded mum, hugging me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know as normally, any  person who wanders into those woods is found dead... or worse.\" replied Khan, sadly. \"You are the first victim of that area to survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my jaw drop as if to scream only mum screamed for me as... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was painful as my body now felt so heavy it was torturous to my muscles. I heard myself scream a number of times, begging everyone to stop but Dr Khan insisted I keep moving. I was in so much pain, it felt as if they were at me for days when it had barely been an hour before I was finally able to somewhat move on my own. It was still difficult though and I was desperate to lay back down but Dr Khan shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are tired, Jon.\" patiently, he said. \"I have seen this condition in the woods before.\" he winced. \"Trust me, you do not want to stop moving until you can get to the point you are able to move freely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to protest as I was becoming irritable but stopped as I heard a loud crack, followed my another. Each one was followed by one part of my body being able to move more freely. Within minutes, I was able to freely move and looked down to find what looked like a random pile of rocks all around me. I turned to Dr Khan, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was your first layer of 'skin' falling off, Jon.\" he said. \"You may not know this but your transformation added at least a foot to your height and a good hundred pounds.\" pausing, he added, \"What you have is a condition known only in mythology, the birth of a stone golem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A- A what!?\" surprised that I was also able to speak better, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If our efforts pay off, you will be losing the other 'shell' in a moment.\" serious, Dr Khan said. \"Weather it will come back only time will tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if your efforts didn't pay off?\" nervous, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Khan sighed and showed me a mirror. \"If they didn't pay off, this is your new look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the mirror, I screamed as I saw my own face but it appeared to have been carved from solid rock!<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

When it was over, I found that I was myself again but blushed brightly, discovering I was completely naked. The nurses blushed and started to giggle as they turned away but mum was quick to grab a sheet and wrap it around me. \"Easy, Jon, it's okay.\" gently picking me up from the rock pile, she said. \"You're free from the stone, you're going to be alright now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, this may only be the beginning.\" wincing, Dr Khan said. \"I want to run a full series of tests, just to be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You- You think I might turn into stone again?\" startled, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said before, you are the first to survive this petrifying process.\" serious, Dr Khan said. \"We have no idea what to expect so I need to run tests on you and your 'shed skin' to see what is going on inside of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, uncertain what to do and turned to mum who nodded at me. \"It's best you let them run the tests.\" firmly but kindly, she said. \"Especially since everyone else this happened to had died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not argue with that and slowly nodded. \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, the needle broke under the pressure he was using to try to pierce through. \"What's wrong, doctor?\" worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems as if the last secretion of... err... living stone has made your skin much more dense than usual.\" taking up a scalpel, Dr Khan replied. \"I'm going to see if I can't make an incision and take a blood sample that way.\" looking at me, he said, \"Relax, I'll be as gentle as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Dr Khan brought the blade down and tried to make an incision but, to his dismay, the blade would not make a scratch on my skin. \"Amazing.\" shaking his head, Khan said. \"Simply amazing. Your skin had become like a suit of armor, I can not get through it by normal means.\" pausing to think, he turned to mum. \"Do I have your permission to try a medical drill to get a blood sample?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?!\" fearful, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was not about to allow this man, doctor or not to drill holes in me. Only, to my horror, mum reluctantly nodded. \"Just try to be gentle, doctor.\" sighing, she said. \"My son is petrified as it is.\" she winced, seeing my expression. \"Sorry, wrong choice of words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I will only drill far enough down to draw a little blood to study.\" leaving the room, Khan said. \"I'll only be a minute, I have to run to surgery to get the medical drill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be alright, Jon.\" trying to sound comforting, mum said. \"We need to learn what is happening inside of you so we can deal with it, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm scared, mum.\" trembling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I, dear.\" honestly, mum said. \"I'm scared for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, Khan returned with what looked like a small version of a battery operated hand drill and opened a small package that contained a sterile drill. \"Normally, we use this drill to make a hole in a patient's skull to relieve pressure in case if internal bleeding.\" preparing the drill, he said. \"I hope this will break through that skin of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a frightening whirring sound, the drill came to life and Khan brought it down onto my arm and began to push, the drill immediately straining. Slowly, and with effort, the drill bit finally broke through and my arm began to bleed slightly through the puncture wound. \"At last.\" sweating slightly, Khan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving quickly, Khan got a blood sample then instructed a nurse to send it to the lab to be analyzed carefully and thoroughly. \"i want the results the moment they are in.\" he instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, doctor.\" nodding, the nurse replied. then she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. doctor.\" my eyes widening, I said. \"It's happening again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhan spun around and saw the 'cement' seeping out of the puncture wound. \"Hold still!\" grabbing a scalpel, he said. \"I'll need to get a sample of the fresh matter to study!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScraping a piece of the 'cement' while it was still liquid, Khan quickly placed it into a glass jar and sealed it closed before turning to mum. \"We have to get your son moving around so this... next layer will fall off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMum nodded tearfully, remembering how much I screamed the first time. The process of making me move in my now even heavier form began and I screamed out in agony, not having the time to recover from the first bout with the new weight and mass. However, moving freely became a little faster than before but the rock form did not fall off as it did the first time. \"I thought this was supposed to fall off of me!\" confused and frightened, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to expect, Jon.\" honestly, Khan said. \"This is new territory for both of us so we are just going to have to wing it and move on with the tests.\" the then held out a compression stick. \"Say ah....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my mouth and said, \"Ah!\" and was surprised by how deep my voice was and how it seemed to shake the windows of the room. \"Jon!\" scolding, mum said. \"There is no need to shout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he was shouting.\" as I pouted, Khan said. \"I believe his voice is simply more powerful in this form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe test continued for nearly twenty minutes before a familiar cracking sound was heard and my rock skin fell off, revealing my normal skin again only it was now a light shade of grey. \"The secretions seem to be changing his body.\" frowning, Khan said. \"This is not good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" frightened, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhan sighed. \"I do not know if I can reverse this.\" looking at you, he said. \"You may permanently become a person of living stone unless I can find a way to change that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI broke down at that as mum comforted me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to get some rest, Jon.\" tiredly, Khan said. \"We will pick this up again in a half hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" panicked, I said. \"What if the 'cement' comes out again!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't be far.\" promised Khan. \"I will help you get to the bottom of this but I don't want to push you or I into exhaustion, we all need to stay alert.\" serious, he said, \"You are the first in a long time to come out of those woods alive, I want it to stay that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he left.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I did not remember being woken up in a half hour, or for several hours, meaning I was either really out of it after the last transformation or Dr Khan decided to let me to sleep through the night. Upon looking at myself, however, I screamed, finding my body encased in that strange stone like shell again. My scream woke up mom and she screamed as well, alerting the medical staff who ran in and began to help me move about as Dr Khan entered with a strange machine on a cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the fourth transformation in an hour!\" said one nurse, helping me to move my arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's getting heavier each time.\" commented another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I think I can move on my own, ma'am.\" politely, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurses looked at me surprised but stepped away as I freely moved my arms and legs. I got up from the bed, startling everyone, and stood without feeling heavy. I heard sighs of relief as I did not fall, making me guess that I had fallen before during the night. \"Was I asleep when you guys worked on me last night?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were in a sort of daze.\" gently, the first nurse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely to dumb the pain from moving with all that extra weight.\" added the second nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had to get more and more creative to gain any blood samples from you.\" motioning to the machine, Khan said. \"This is a surgical laser, one of the first portable units ever built.\" he smiled. \"This is the first time all night you had been able to move about without screaming in pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see myself?\" politely, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first nurse nodded and motioned to a full length mirror on one of the small closet doors. Turning to it, I saw that I was at least a foot taller and that my skin was smooth but light grey in color with what looked like muscle upon muscle on every part of my body. \"I look like an alien body builder.\" managing a smile, I said. \"At least I can recognize my face as my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurses giggled as mom and Khan smiled. \"You look rather handsome, Jon.\" complimenting me, mom said. \"A little body paint and you'll look like any regular person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a regular Olympian.\" chuckling, I said. \"For the first time since I woke up in here, I feel great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at my reflection in the mirror for a short while, taking in my new look, then turned to Khan. \"Do you think I'm done changing or will this all fall off again?\" frowning, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Khan sighed and replied...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How do <i>I</i> introduce myself then? :  I'm on the bed too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?\" I asked instead, perturbed by his skeletal structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy surveyed me nervously.  \"I'm on the bed,\" He repeated again, as though trying to convince himself so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I replied, feeling crazily ridiculous.  \"Sorry to disappoint, but you're errr... standing on the, um, floor, in my ward btw...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at me, as though horrified that I had spoken the unspeakable.  Then he snapped out of his daze, and gave himself a full body scan.  (I mean, who did that sort of thing?)  Gingerly, fearfully, he reached out and poked himself.  (I was starting to think that that guy belonged with the loons.)  And finally, his hands shaking like a boat in on choppy waters, he recoiled it sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" I questioned, concerned now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked as though he'd seen a ghastly ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" I waved my uninjured hand in front of his dazed face.  Multitasking, I used the other to point at the empty seat previously occupied by my Mom.  \"Don't faint on me,\" I advised.  \"Just settle there and... you know, chill out...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy followed my orders robotically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was revising my social skills in my head - to start some small talk of course- when the door flung open, revealing a girl my age with a water cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely acknowledged me with a lazy tilt of her head, completely ignored the 'I'm-on-the-bed' boy (I don't know his name), and carted the water cart in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you too,\" I muttered sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard ya, kid,\" She scowled in my direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided I didn't really like her.  From her uniform, she was a hundred and one percent, undoubtedly, a candy-striper.  Ugh, the standard has deproved drastically.  Can't they hire some better kids?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The idiot din't even bother to acknowledge me,\" The 'I'm-on-the-bed-boy' finally decided to join the conversation.  \"What am I, a ghost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl didn't even bother to <i>act</i> like she heard it.  It was as though... he hadn't spoken?  It started to get me jittery.  This girl could either a) act amazingly well - pretending not to have heard a thing, b) really didn't hear, or c) was being her usual idiotic self.  Option c seemed the most likely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, this one really had an attitude problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" I piped up<i> loudly</i> towards the 'I'm-on-the-bed-boy'.  \"I <i>totally</i> agree.  Let's sign a petition to get <i>her</i> sacked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm-on-the-bed-boy' nodded in quick staccato nods, looking enthusiastic at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned.  We'd finally caught her attention.  The girl's eyes immediately snapped up incredulously from her job, to study me skeptically.  Her eyebrows raised itself on it's own accord, and she murmured, \"Whoa, you're in a worse condition than I imagined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talking to an imaginary friend,\"  She snickered at me outrightly.  \"Either you're <i>really </i>desperate for one, or <i>really</i> just a nutcase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" 'I'm-on-the-bed-boy' hollered, jumping to his feet and lunging at her in a flurry.  \"What do you mean-\"  His hands slid right through her.  No, not around.  But THROUGH.  It was... gross.  However, at the moment, the only thing that flashed through my mind was:  Oh. My. Gosh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm-on-the-bed-boy' screamed in horror, doubling back into me, and yeah, zipping right <i>through</i> me like a bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was my turn to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMean girl nearly dropped the water jar.  She frowned at me for a single puzzled moment, before glancing at the ceiling, expecting it to fall and squish us, or something.  When nothing exciting happened, she glanced back at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your problem, sissy kid?\" She demanded.  \"Even my younger sis ain't that sissy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Deep breaths</i>, I convinced myself.  <i>Deep breaths.</i>  So... she hadn't witnessed the whole 'stick-my-hand-through-your-body' stunt?  She... couldn't see 'I'm-on-the-bed-boy'?  But I could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo naturally, I just freaked out.</span></div></div>",

That turned out to be a good decision as I saw many spirits pass the room moments later. Some of them peered in and gave me a longing, almost envious look. I came to realize then that many of the recently dead remained in the hospital for a while because they did not want to die. I suspected some would be desperate enough to take another person's body just to taste the 'sweet' breath of life once again. It was also wise of me not to acknowledge their looks as it would have tipped them off that I could see them and I was not yet ready to deal with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get out of here.\" panicked, I whispered. \"This place is giving me the creeps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, honey.\" said mom, looking at my half open eyes. \"You're dreaming, go back to sleep.

Unfortunately, I was half awake and smiled as I caught her eye. \"Hello.\" not realizing she was a ghost yet, I said. \"Are you lost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at me as if I had startled her then floated over to me, which was when I realized she was a ghost. \"You- You can see me?\" tearing up, the girl asked. \"I thought I was dead as no one talked to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed at the little girl, feeling sorry for her as she did not yet realize the gravity of her situation. Not that I could blame her, the girl looked to be no older that five or six years old. \"What is your name?\" hoping to be gentle, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya Jennings.\" shyly, the girl replied. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Jon Que.\" sitting up, I said. \"Can you tel me why you are at the hospital?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" shrugging her shoulders, Maya replied. \"I woke up here and got up to see my body, lying in a bed with wires hooked on it.\" sobbing a little, she added, \"I got scared and ran off to find someone to help me but no one would look at me or even listen so I tried to go back to my body... it wasn't there anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya sobbed more, shivering and I guessed I did not have much time before she would be a ghost permanently and tried to think of a way to help her. Finally, an idea came to me and I jumped from my own body and took a hold of her hand, startling her. She looked at me uncertain weather to trust me or run away. \"You look cold.\" smiling at her, I said. \"Please, let me help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill uncertain, Maya slowly nodded and I pulled her into my own body. It felt strange allowing a ghost to possess me but I could almost feel her blushing. \"You're warm.\" her voice whispering into my ear, she said. \"Thank you but I need my own body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to help you find it.\" staggering out of bed, I whispered. \"Only I am a patient here too so I have to be careful not to be caught.

The man appeared to be strangely well dressed for someone who lived in shack that was also inside of a cave. He was wearing a pair of black slacks, a white button down shirt, and a black vest, yeah way to fancily dressed for a man who lives in a cave, what was even stranger was the man's hair color. Short feathery locks of pure white framed his face, the man must have heard me coming since before I knew it, I was looking directly into two purple orbs bearing a big, pointy-toothed, grin. \"Oh, I see you're up, that wasn't long at all, I thought you'd be out much longer, I mean that was a pretty high fall,\" the man said. The man slowly stood up, and I nearly fell back onto my butt, the man simply towered over me. The man had a bloody rag in hand as he walked closer, gently placing a hand on my fore head. His hand was as cold as ice, no warmth in it, I couldn't say anything, I couldn't even move, I've never been so scared in my life. \"Hmm you're still very feverish, why don't you go lay back down while I finish cleaning up?\" he asked, still smiling, though I felt that I'd never trust that smile for as long as I lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't say a word, the man just stared at me, his smile turning into a confused frown, he waved his hand in front of my eyes. \"Hello? Anybody there? If you're not going to do it yourself, I could always carry you back to the bedroom,\" he threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally shook out of my daze and stumbled back from the tall male, \"N-no, I-I can do it,\" I stuttered, my eyes locked onto his. The male chuckled, smiling again, messing up my hair, before walking back into the boarded up shack, I took one last glance at the hole, before I turned around and followed the white haired male. He disappeared down the hall, to the laundry room I assumed. I looked around, but I found there was no place to run off to. Defeated I turned to the bedroom and slowly walked inside, I decided that I would just have to do what the man said, I was wounded, and I was in no condition to run away. I grunted as I sat down on bed, holding onto my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few good minutes before the man returned, the man actually having duck through the doorway as he entered the bedroom. He shook his head, \"That's not laying down,\" he said as he moved closer, I tried to argue as the man lowered me down to the bed, but I could only hiss in pain, my injuries still haven't healed. \"Just relax, I'm not going to hurt you, I promise,\" he told me. I laid there, obviously uncomfortable, as he pulled up a chair and sat down. \"My name's Cecil Morpheus Von Haeide, and unfortunately for you, you have three broken ribs, and a fractured wrist,\" he smirked. \"It's not often I get visitors falling from the sky, well actually, this would be the first time I've ever had that happen, but still. Anyway what were you doing in the forest Anyway?\" I remained silent, I was going to die before I'd give the man a single bit of information to work with. The man frowned again, \"Not the talkative type huh, will you at least tell me your name?\" I shook my head. He sighed in defeat, \"Well since none of my questions have been working, how about you ask me a question, go on, ask anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought for a bit before I finally opened my mouth and asked...</span></div></div>",

His right arm seemed normal but his left arm looked like it had been replaced with a long thorny vine with large spike like thorns for fingers on his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good gracious!\" my eyes wide with shock, I exclaimed. \"What happened to you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smiled, his blood red lips not opening as he stifled a soft laugh. \"I was born this way.\" simply, he replied. \"It is something not of my choosing but I like who I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecil cleared his throat, catching my attention. \"Mark here is a Mandrake; a human/plant hybrid.\" to my shock, he explained. \"Only, unlike the inaccurate legends of old, Mark is quite powerful as he is wields the power of an ecomancer, the ability to control plant life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'll take you- your word for it.\" frightened, I said. \"Um... Cecil said you sensed I was... special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark nodded. \"You are special but, I fear, not in the way you might think.\" almost sadly, he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How exactly do you believe I am special?\" curious, I asked. I then winced and quickly added, \"Not that I'm ungrateful or anything like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark chuckled. \"Relax, it's fine.\" calmly, he said. \"I do not know exactly what makes you special, its a just a feeling and I have learned not to ignore such feelings when I get them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see....\" gulping, I said. \"Well, as soon as I am able to travel, I should get myself home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't be for a while, my dear boy.\" firmly but kindly, Cecil said. \"We can not, in good conscious, let you walk away from here in the condition you are in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long climb to the surface.\" wincing, Mark said. \"It's difficult for a healthy person, impossible for one as injured as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother is going to be worried sick.\" groaning, I said. \"If I make it out of here, she'll 'kill' me for taking a shortcut through the woods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you were doing up there?\" came a soft feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, I strained my head to look passed Cecil and Mark to see a young girl, no older than ten or twelve standing by the door.

She was very cute and seemed rather shy. \"I thought you were running from someone.\" blushing, the girl said. she rose a dainty hand to her mouth, quivering with a certain sadness. \"My bad, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made the ground give way under me?\" stunned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl teared up, stifling a sob. \"I said I was sorry.\" looking hurt, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon, this Viva.\" motioning to the small girl, Cecil said. \"She is a young...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mark gave her a nod and slowly closed the door. \"She is very young.\" turning to me, Mark explained. \"We don't want to give her nightmares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could react, Mark viciously swung his vine like thorny arm onto my bandages.

I?\" tearing up, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sighed. \"We fear that either Viva, I, or both accidentally scratched you.\" darkly, he replied. \"If that is so, you will be just like her or me within a few days time.\" he shook his head. \"I'm sorry but you will not be human anymore when the changes are finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis proved to be too much for me and I fainted...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke up, what seemed like hours, later to find myself in a spacious bedroom. It had all the markings of a modern colonial home with a spacious walk in closet to my left, large windows on my right, though they looked out into the cave, a dresser between the two windows, and a couch against the far wall with a coffee table in front of it. Not far from the closet was a closed door I guessed was the way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must have fainted.\" rubbing my eyes, I muttered. \"But where am I now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I heard some soft, approaching footsteps echoing from beyond the door, followed by the inaudible metallic click of the door unlocking.  I had a visitor. I jumped out of bed to find that I was now wearing clean pajamas. \"What!?\" surprised, I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time to ponder over it, however, my new host was at the door and I felt the need to confront whoever it was. Not knowing who my host was or how many there were, I quickly positioned myself behind the opening door to gain the advantage of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready for you!\" I thought. \"Come on in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited, motionless, muscles tightening, preparing myself for who ever my host might have been. I hoped it was the same people who I had met earlier but experience taught me to be on guard when I wake up in a strange place. The door swung inward, hiding my form, and a small girl cautiously entered, leaving the door open behind her.  She was carrying a small key in one hand and balancing a silver tray holding a pitcher of water, a tall glass and a few sandwiches in the other.  She stuffed the key into her dress pocket then took the tray into both hands and continued to carefully walk into the room. \"Jon?\" she asked softly. \"Are you awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave out an inaudible sigh, seeing Viva. I pushed the door away from me but I guess I did not know my own strength as the door slammed closed, the sound echoing in the room. Viva stiffened, paralyzed with fear. For a second, I thought there was going to be an earthquake, remembering that the ground reacts to her emotions. \"I'm right behind you.\" softly, I said. \"Sorry if I startled you, I did not mean to slam the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva turned around slowly, her hands trembling. \"Do- Do you remember me?\" looking frightened, she asked. \"We met the other day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered why Viva was scared I would not remember her but waved it off. \"I remember you, Viva.\" managing a smile, I said. \"Tell me, where are my clothes and why was the door locked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your clothes are being washed, they were dirty.\" smiling slightly, Viva replied. \"The door was locked so you could sleep in peace, it unlocks easily from the inside, silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a nervous chuckle, blushing slightly, causing Viva to giggle. \"I brought you some water and snacks in case you were hungry.\" she said. \"It's peanut butter and jelly. I prefer topsoil and worms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced at that then remembered that Viva was a rock golem, they must not eat like humans do. Strangely, the mention of her favorite food seemed to make my mouth water a little. \"I-I'll take the peanut butter and jelly, please.\" smiling, I said. \"Can you tell me where we are? This can't be the shack I woke up in earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the shack is for new arrivals and intruders.\" shaking her head, Viva said. \"This is the main house, its too deep into the cave for any human to find and make his way out. It's where we all live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean there are more of you?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva giggled. \"Of course, you silly willy.\" placing the tray onto the coffee table, she said. \"There are six of us, counting Cecil.\" she smiled at me. \"You make seven, a lucky number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not help smile at that and took up one of the sandwiches. Viva gasped and opened her mouth to speak but I had already taken a bite. The sandwich had a gritty and gooey taste to it but it was not half bad. \"Do you guys make your own peanut butter and jelly?\" after swallowing, I asked. \"It tastes a bit off but its still pretty good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva laughed, holding her sides. \"That was one of my sandwiches, topsoil and worms!\" still laughing, she said. she composed herself and wiped away a tear from laughter. \"Do you really like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened, realizing what I had just taken a bit of and swallowed down. I looked at the sandwich and nearly choked, seeing that the worms were still moving! \"Um... I...\" stammering, I said. then I blushed brightly and sighed. \"It... wasn't... half bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva laughed again as the door to the room opened. \"How is our patient doing, Viva?\" asked an unfamiliar voice. \"Is he able to move about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned, still blushing, to find....<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She stood on eight, yes, eight powerful legs which one would think was her most unusual feature. At first glance, I thought she was a Dridder, a human/spider hybrid. However, that definition somehow did not seem to fit her. I did not see anything that looked like a spider's abdomen but a human one. It was as if she had an ill formed Siamese twin and she was using her arms and legs with her own two to move about. Even more, there was a certain hunger in her eyes that caused me to want to turn away but I could not.  I found myself staring, trying to figure out exactly who or what had entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Yoko.\" smiling, Viva said. \"Jon seems to be doing better than yesterday.\" she giggled before adding, \"He even ate one of my topsoil and worm sandwiches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko rose a single eyebrow, turning to me. \"He ate the entire sandwich?\" surprised, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed, trying my best to look away. \"It wasn't too bad.\" softly, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong...Jon?\" darkly, Yoko asked. \"Does my appearance frighten or appall you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.\" quickly, I replied. \"It's just I never saw a real Dridder before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko gave a low giggle. \"I'm not a Dridder.\" smiling slightly, she replied. \"I am a Tsuchigumo, there is a difference between the two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You- You're a what?\" confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Sue- chi- gum- o.\" emphasizing the syllables, Yoko said. \"I am from Japan. A dridder is literally half human and half spider where a Tsuchigumo is a 'human' with the characteristics of a spider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoko can make silk, like a real spider, but it comes from her hair.\" turning to me, Viva explained. \"Also, she has a ven -um -is bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's venomous.\" tapping one foot, Yoko corrected. \"I can speak for myself, thank you.\" she then turned to me. \"I give everyone here the same warning; if you want to stay alive, stay out of my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know where your room is.\" meekly, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He got you there, Yoko.\" laughing, Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush or I'll bite you.\" impatient, Yoko hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll only hurt your teeth.\" folding her arms over her chest, Viva countered. she childishly stuck out her tongue to make her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled not to laugh as Yoko sighed. \"My room is on the opposite end of the hall from yours.\" pointing out the door, she said. \"No one goes in there but me unless you wish to be eaten. Is that clear, Jon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, its clear.\" quickly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko then smiled. \"Good; then we should get along just fine.\" relaxing a little, she said. \"I'm glad to see you are in better shape than before, you heal impressively fast for a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down, solemn. \"Mark told me I won't likely be human for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko pulled my head up with her hand so to face me. \"That is why you are here.\" softly, she said. \"Welcome to Monster Manor.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'normal'. Such humans are rare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother may welcome you, Jon.\" touching my hand, Viva said. \"But can she protect you against everyone else?\" she looked down, solemn. \"I was adopted by humans, they were kind to me but they were killed... protecting me from... those who were... not kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart went out to Viva. Having to lose not one set of parents but two had to be very hard for her to take at such a young age. I knelled down and hugged her as she silently sobbed against my shoulder until she was able to compose herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are a handful of humans out there who are genuinely kind, Jon.\" serious, Yoko said. \"However, it is impossible to determine who is good and who is evil until it is almost too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded in response and decided to change the subject. \"Viva mentioned there were six others, counting Cecil.\" I said. \"Will I meet the other two later on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When they are ready to introduce themselves.\" firmly but kindly, Yoko said. \"You are still very human but they will warm up to you once the changes are complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecil was the one who brought me, everyone here.\" drying her tears of pebbles, Viva said. \"He told us that he stays in this world due to an unfinished business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecil was a monster hunter in life.\" flatly, Yoko said. \"He had killed hundreds of what humans considered to be monsters in his career.\" she sighed. \"Only, near the end of his life, he realized that he was the monster and sacrificed himself to save Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was the first monster here.\" managing a smile, Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark helped Cecil build all four mansions, minus the fire mansion.\" serious, Yoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I helped build that one.\" beaming, Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko grinned. \"Viva may appear to be about twelve but stone lives a long time, she is actually twelve hundred years old.\" she explained. \"She is practically immortal unless....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words hung in the air as Viva began to tear up. I guessed that she would be vulnerable to some form of explosives. Again, I quickly changed the subject. \"So Cecil is redeeming himself by finding a way to protect monsters instead of hunting them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct.\" replied Cecil, appearing in the room. \"Mark has breakfast ready, I suggest you bring Jon down so he can meet the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva beamed, taking my hand. \"Come on, I can't wait for you to meet Vesper and Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had long red hair with blond highlights that made her hair look almost like fire. A cute pink hair band kept her hair out of her eyes, her red eyes. Upon seeing this, I took a fearful step back but a gentle smile from her eased that a little and I relaxed some. Hannah was wearing loose fitting blue jeans, a tank top shirt and a long jacket, giving her a city girl look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He should not have been allowed in here until the change!\" huffing, Vesper said. \"He's a human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vesper, be nice!\" scolding, Hannah said. \"Our guest will not be human for long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until then, he is still human.\" more softly, Vesper countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember what it was like to be human?\" serious, Hannah asked. \"To slowly change then be rejected by those you knew? Those you love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah...\" moaning, Vesper said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Vesper.\" sternly, Hannah said. \"He is going through the same nightmare you did; will you have him suffer as you did or will you help him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVesper sighed then turned his glowing yellow eyes back onto me before throwing back his hood. I did not know what to expect, having never seen a shadow person before. I had thought of the possibility that he had no face but that vanished when I saw that he did. Vesper was much like Cecil, ghost like, only he translucent rather than transparent. That, and he was solid; I heard the floor creek as he took a step back, allowing us to come down. Upon meeting him face to face, he took my hand and gave it a quick shake. \"I apologize... I did not mean to come off so cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged off the apology. \"It's alright.\" softly, I said. \"Yoko told me you had bad experiences with people after your... change. I can only hope I'll be accepted when I return home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand you wanting to go back home to your family, Jon.\" sadly, Hannah said. \"However, I fear you may suffer the same rejection as Vesper did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I feel great.\" politely, I protested. \"I never felt better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how it starts.\" serious, Vesper said. \"Just wait until tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shivered at that, having no idea what I may become but paused as Yoko placed a firm hand onto my shoulder, startling me. \"We can all discuss this over some breakfast.\" firmly but kindly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI descended the stairs and turned to Hannah, curious. She did not look like any monster I had heard of; in fact, she looked like a very attractive young woman. As if sensing my thoughts, Hannah giggled. \"I am a Kitsune, Jon.\" smiling, she said. \"Like Yoko, I am from Japan; we are the best of friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Kitsune?\" confused, I asked. \"That is a fox spirit, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah smiled and took off her head band, allowing two fox like ears near the top of her head to rise before she removed her jacket, revealing three beautiful fox like tails that twitched slightly as she smiled at me. \"See? I'm a Kitsune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Kitsune, or fox spirit is considered a great prize due to the power they are said to possess.\" more seriously, Yoko said. \"Hannah fled Japan as she did not wish to be owned by anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" softly, I said. \"I guess you all had it rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough talk.\" firmly, Cecil said. \"Let's all go eat.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Upon being lead into the dinning room, I was surprised to see what seemed like a normal hodgepodge of breakfast items on a long table near a round table in the center of the room. \"Don't pick out anything until you know what it is.\" smiling, Yoko said. \"You might not like what you bite into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suggest?\" looking at the various, I asked. \"The eggs look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko giggled. \"Well, you could eat one but I doubt you'll enjoy it.\" amused, she said. \"Those are small animals I had caught and tightly spun in my silk to be dissolved so I may drink them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced, hearing that but I could not hold down my curiosity. \"What- What do they taste like?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like chicken broth, I guess.\" shrugging, Yoko replied. \"Want to try a sip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced again, uncertain. \"Um... maybe later.\" politely, I said. \"What are the others having?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have a few of my topsoil and worm sandwiches.\" smiling, Viva said. \"You seemed to like the last one you had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah giggled. \"You ate one of her sandwiches!?\" surprised, she asked. \"Did you really like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't too bad.\" blushing, I replied. \"If I knew what it was, I probably would not have tried it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saying that it wasn't too bad tells us that your tastes are already changing, Jon.\" serious, Cecil said. \"I suggest you just pick something and try it. That will give us some clue as to what you are slowly transforming into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped at that then turned to the variety of foods in front of me. Viva took up a number of sandwiches with worms wiggling in them and a few wet stones from a dish of water. \"Creek rocks are the best.\" turning to me, she said. \"They are full of minerals, perfect for me to grow strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they are a little too hard for me.\" smiling, you said. \"So, polite pass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care for some ham or beef?\" offering me a plate, Hannah asked. \"There is plenty to share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, I would have accepted. Only, for some reason, the very sight of raw meat was unappetizing. \"That's strange.\" curious, I said. \"I usually love ham and beef but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on that table looks good to you?\" walking up, Mark asked. \"Don't think about what it is, just tell me what you think might taste good to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed and turned back to the table. \"The topsoil and worm sandwiches still sound pretty good.\" to Viva's giggles, I said. \"The cinnamon sticks look good too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are hollowed out branches, stuffed with live insects, and capped with baked mud.\" with a grin, Mark explained. \"They are my favorite food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko placed a number of her 'eggs' onto a plate. \"Why not try one?\" simply, she asked. \"What do you have to lose?\" she giggled, adding, \"Besides maybe a stomach ache later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are actually really good.\" taking a few, Mark said. \"Just try one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctantly, I took one of the bark and insect branches and two of the topsoil and worm sandwiches before turning to the table. \"Where do I sit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can sit next to me.\" beaming, Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's Vesper's seat.\" firmly but kindly, Cecil said. \"He has to eat too.\" he then turned to me. \"You may sit between Yoko and Hannah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone took their seats, Cecil lead everyone through grace before they all began to eat...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As I chewed, I tried not to think what it was filled with but instead focused only on the taste. \"It- It's pretty good.\" after swallowing, I said. \"Considering what it's made of, I kind of like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you knew what was in a hot dog, you'd likely never eat it again.\" bemused, Hannah said. \"However, this does not reveal much regarding what you are changing into but it does give us a few clues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to tear into the raw ham, giving a low growl as she tore a piece off and chewed it down before gripping the food with her mouth again to rip off another piece. It was actually cute, seeing such a cute girl rip into her food like a hungry kitten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think I'm going to be anything carnivorous.\" sighing, I said. \"Considering what I now think about ham and beef.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so sure about that.\" serious, Yoko said. she bit into one of her 'eggs' and slurped a few sips from the insides. \"I do not like raw ham or beef but I can assure you I am very carnivorous.\" pausing, she added, \"Your curiosity as to how my food tasted hints at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shivered at the thought then gasped, seeing my hand. \"What is this!?\" almost shouting, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was what looked like a green rash on my hand, it was oozing with a clear liquid, like water, only a little more viscus. I instinctively touched it and found that it was soft, like moss. Mark took a hold of my hand and looked at it. \"The external changes are beginning.\" softly, he said. \"That can only mean that the internal changes are almost done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I changing into!?\" panicking, I asked. \"Do any of you have a guess!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's difficult to tell without knowing more about you.\" serious, Yoko replied. \"You may have been changing inside for quite a while before encountering us.\" taking a moment to think, she asked, \"Which path were you using to take that shortcut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter?\" more worried about my rash, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It matters more than you think.\" serious, Cecil replied. \"The forest above us is not considered haunted because of us, there are creatures up there most humans would rather avoid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which was one of the reasons why the mansions were built in this cavern system.\" chiming in, Vesper said. \"They are deep with a twisting maze of tunnels but they can be navigated. The forest above serves as an extra measure to keep the curious away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a small burp caused me to turn to see Viva had grown a full foot in height!  She blushed, seeing my surprised expression. \"Excuse me.\" softly, she said. she then turned to Vesper. \"I think I'm ready for you to feed now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVesper nodded and I watched as he rose from his seat and stood behind her. He opened his mouth, revealing two long fangs! At first, I thought he was going to bite Viva on the neck but Vesper instead bit into nothing and Viva tilted her head, moaning quietly. This confused me until I saw their shadows. Vesper's shadow as biting Viva's shadow, he was feeding off her through her very shadow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow people do not need to get close to their victim to feed.\" darkly, Cecil said. \"All they need is for their shadow to touch theirs. That is what makes them so frightening to humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to watch and saw that Viva was slowly shrinking down to her original size. Within minutes, Vesper walked away from Viva and took his seat. Viva let out another moan then took up a crick rock and began to nibble on it. \"I'll be fine, you silly.\" seeing my worrisome expression, she said. \"Vesper always gets full before I get too small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Vesper who gave me a slight grin. \"Don't scratch it.\" calmly, he said. \"You'll only speed up the process, making it more painful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't know what I'm changing into.\" tearing up, I said. \"What if I become a...\" I silenced myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if you become a threat?\" looking at me, Cecil asked. I nodded and he smiled. \"Do not worry, we know what to do, we will help you.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I took a little bite, again surprised by how soft it seemed and took in a tiny amount. Again, I was very surprised. \"It does taste like chicken broth.\" almost whispering, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, I tossed the egg into my mouth and chewed it up before swallowing it down. For a moment, Yoko and Viva stared at me in shock. Before I realized what I had just done, they both fell into a fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you ate one of Yoko's eggs.\" giggling, Viva said. \"You took it down, webbing and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mind.\" shrugging, Yoko said. \"Any major transformation takes a lot of energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I was more hungry than I thought.\" blushing, I said. \"Do you think I was eating whatever I could to get that energy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's part of it.\" serious, Vesper replied. \"I ate ravenously during my transformation but I can no longer eat as normal people do.\" he sighed, adding, \"I miss the taste of a juicy steak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one can do anything to change that, Vesper.\" patiently, Cecil said. \"You could taste steak if you possessed a human and gain from its proteins by taking it from the host but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice trailed off but it was enough to remind me that I was the only human in the group; at least for the moment. I turned from Cecil to Vesper then sighed. \"You can use me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVesper turned to me, surprised. \"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can possess me and eat a steak.\" more loudly, I said. \"I'm still human for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I am sure Vesper appreciates the offer, Jon, its just too dangerous.\" firmly, Cecil said. \"He could devour you completely without realizing it, leaving you a shadow person, like him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm changing into something anyway.\" ruefully, I countered. \"Besides... I think I can trust him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVesper gave me another surprised look but paused as Hannah placed a gentle hand onto his shoulder. \"He has given you his permission, Vesper.\" calmly, she said. \"Just do it and enjoy your steak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others voiced their approval, causing Cecil to sigh. \"It looks like I'm out voted.\" frowning, he said. \"Just do not say I did not give you fair warning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Cecil prepared a steak, extra peppery to Vesper's request and placed it hot on a plate in front of me. \"Okay, everyone remain quiet.\" firmly, Cecil said. \"I want this to go smoothly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVesper, looking famished, stepped to my side then sat down onto my lap, his shadow like form moving easily into my body until his form completely covered my own. I looked down to see my hands move to take up the fork and knife. I cut a piece of the steak off and put it into my mouth. Upon chewing it, I heard a moan of delight from Vesper. \"It's sooooo good!\" happily, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finishing the steak, Vesper got up from the chair, leaving me unharmed but very hungry. \"I think he emptied my entire stomach.\" grumbling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's plenty to eat, help yourself.\" smiling, Mark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Vesper placed a hand onto my shoulder. \"Thank you.\" smiling, he said. \"That was the best steak, the only steak I had in years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure.\" smiling back, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVesper then walked away, leaving me to eat as Hannah then turned to me. \"You have earned his friendship, Jon.\" whispering, she said. \"Not bad for your first day among us.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Vesper will be tempted to feed, the webs will alert us of his movements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if he is a shadow person...\" confused, I said. \"How would webs help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoko's webs pick up more than just movement, they detect energy as well.\" softly, Mark said. \"She is the only one who can fight Vesper if the hunger takes control of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vesper can not feed off of Yoko.\" with a smirk, Mark replied. \"Her life energy is... shall we say, too spicy for his taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spider venom?\" guessing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark nodded. \"Exactly.\" he then gave me a firm slap onto the shoulder. \"I have to go help Viva patrol the cave.

I mean... I understand that's your whole goal, helping monsters and all... but can you actually do anything?\" I tilted my head frowning a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Yoko can usually handle the putting up of her webs herself, but I always have to be there. You see she spins her webs extra thin so when Vesper gets out he won't notice them. However they also need to be strong enough to sense the energies he carries about. Which is why I'm here.\" Cecil said matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I think i get it... you and him are both mostly energy right? So since we can't have Vesper test them out we use you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely, though I never enjoy this part of the month. I wish I never had to resort to this kind of tactics, trapping, and fighting the monsters i bring here, but it's unavoidable, when it's the only way I can truly help them...\" I looked up at Cecil when he sad that and he had a deep look of sadness painted over his see through face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You really regret hunting them don't you...\" I winced... I never meant to say that though... the words just came out! \"Cecil... I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I really do... but there's no changing the past.\" Cecil said fading off and gliding faster down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough Cecil, what's the new kid doing here?\" Yoko said hanging one of her webs across a doorway, \"If Vesper starts early the kid's cooked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he wanted to help, might as well let him right?

I've had to move these kinds of things before, when my grandmother moved out my family helped, but at that time it took five of us to just push the thing down the hall... sure I'm turning into a monster but there is no way I can move this. Hopefully i don't look too stupid doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI placed my hands firmly on the wood and braced myself into the floor. This thing must be ancient, back when these things weren't just painted to look like wood. It must weigh a ton! Seriously there's no way I ca-AH! There was a loud screeching followed by a the sound of splintering wood just before I fell and knocked my head hard on the wooden floor. Slowly I peeled myself off of the floor and groaned rubbing my head, not noticing the green patches on my arms having spread further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecil whistled from behind me with his hands in his pockets, \"You sure did a number on my wardrobe Jon..... not to mention that side table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at Cecil confused, \"Wa-?\" I turned back to where he was looking and my jaw hit the floor. Apparently when I tried to push the wardrobe, I pushed it hard enough that it slid across the floor a good few feet, ran into a side table, and then crushed the table by slamming into the wall on the other side of the hall. \"W-w-what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jon, if I had to say something, it seems to me your changes are happening faster than expected, and you now have the strength to give viva a fight in an arm wrestling contest.\" Cecil walked over inspecting the damage in his furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko, still hanging her webs, looked over, \"Well.... I guess that removes some of the options he's turning into..... wish I could move stuff like that,\" she said the last part under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecil sighed and looked over at me and shook his head as if he expected this to happen. \"Don't worry Jon... I'll get this fixed, but if you're going to keep helping us... we gotta get that strength back in check till you can use it safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my face turning red and frowned, \"U-uh sorry Cecil,\" the man just chuckled and laid a ghostly hand on my head before going back to helping Yoko. His hand held no weight and I didn't really feel it but, the gesture was nice I guess. I picked myself off the ground and, while still embarrassed, I went back to moving the furniture, thankfully though with only minor damages this time.</span></div></div>",

It made me nervous being able to do all of this so suddenly... yesterday I got winded after a long game of dodge ball during team sports. Cecil must have noticed my strength was troubling me as he walked over and laid a ghostly hand on my shoulder and offering a kind smile. Honestly I'm so glad I ended up here, sure I don't know them, but just having all these people around me who are like me, it makes me feel safe, something I bet allot of 'turning' people wished they had. Finally one last web was mounted across a hallway, just in time two as apparently the sun had just set since Hannah was returning with a basket full of fish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... finally... I know we have to do this pretty often, but I can never get used to how long it takes,\" Cecil chuckled to himself and inspected their work, \"Well there goes my plans for tonight,\" he half joked as he rubbed his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tsuchigumo girl walked up behind him and placed her hands on her hips, \"Since when do YOU have plans, all you ever do is float around the place and ask us questions about facebook,\" Yoko huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecil smiled widely at here, sharp teeth and all (still can't get over those), \"Well since Jon showed up of course, we do have a massive hole near our entrance after all, don't want someone getting hurt again~\" Yoko shrugged at that accepting the answer to be a rather accurate one. I smiled at them, enjoying their company, especially since they took my mind off my current changes, but as I began to approach them and hopefully find out what to do next, my legs simply gave out and my eyes rolled back into my head as I plummeted to the ground. The world was all fuzzy as I heard the rush of feet coming towards me and strong arms lifting me up... must have been Yoko. I couldn't make out what they were saying but they seemed worried, at least I think they were. After that they must have started moving me back to my room, my vision cleared just enough, but my body remained limp and I was just so tired, I looked up to see Yoko's stern expression as she carried me down the hall, Cecil was nearby who offered a smile just before he left down another way, to another wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Yoko made it to my room, surprisingly being gentle as she laid me on the mattress and pulled sheets around me. Despite her bitter attitude and stern looks, she was nice deep down. I tried to speak to her but I barely had enough energy to tilt me head and have it roll to the side. \"Don't speak,\" she said firmly, as she laid a hand on my head, \"You're burning up again... you must have not eaten enough after vesper drained you... get some sleep Jon, I'll tell Cecil what happened...\" After that, before she even left I nodded off. A few seconds later I jumped awake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened?</span></div></div>",

They all sounded frantic; something was very wrong. I guessed that Vesper was on the prowl, as the others had warned me might happen that night. Only then I heard Vesper scream just outside my door, \"Jon! Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes sprung open to reveal vines and branches everywhere in my room! I screamed at the sight then screamed again as they all rushed towards me! My closed door was ripped off its hinges as vines and branches poured into the room and wrapped themselves around me. \"Help!\" Desperate, I screamed. \"Someone help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, I thought I would suffocate under the seemingly endless twisting of vines and branches but for some reason, I felt no pain. As my panic subsided, I realized that I had completely transformed into my monster form. Only why was I attacking my friends in my sleep? Yoko entered shortly after the doorway was cleared and began to pour water onto me. The water was warm but it still sent a chill through me. \"Hey! What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko poured another pitcher of water onto me. \"I was right when I said you did not get enough to eat.\" She gave me a slight grin. \"You gave everyone a real fright when you 'branched out' looking for a drink of water, Jon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny.\" Pouting, I said. \"I didn't hurt anyone, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVesper came into view. \"No one has hurt; just startled out of a night's rest. Thanks to the steak, I was well fed so the hunger did not effect me.\" He rubbed his chin in thought. \"You turned out rather unique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis peeked my curiosity. \"What do I look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko helped me into a sitting position and handed me a mirror. I had soft, moist, dark green moss for skin and dense vines for muscles. I had branches for hands like Mark and deep set eyes with glowing jewels like Viva. My hair was made up of leaves and my finger and toe nails were made of flat stones. \"What- What am I?\" Staring at my reflection, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVesper smiled. \"I believe you are a...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sighed, seeing tears in my eyes. \"You transformed very quickly after coming into contact with Viva and Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It normally takes weeks.\" Chiming in, Mark said. \"I have seen it happen; my parents changed a boy they found dying in their woods.\" He sighed. \"I miss them and my little brother, who was that boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped. \"What happened to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was silent for a moment then replied with two words. \"Forest fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bowed my head, tears falling. \"Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nearly a century ago.\" Softly, Mark said. \"I have moved on.\" His smile returned. \"Let us now focus on you, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned back to him and slowly nodded. \"If my dad was a golem, why was I not born one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother is human.\" Simply, Yoko said. \"Hence you were born with that outward appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only you were a golem on the inside.\" Entering the room, Viva said. \"I sensed you were one but I wasn't sure so I helped you anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, a half smile forming onto my face. \"When you thought I was running from someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I was sorry.\" pouting, Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" Patiently, I said. \"I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is best it happened here with us.\" Serious, Vesper said. \"Otherwise, you would have experienced the same pain and betrayal I did when I was changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happens to me now?\" Worried, I asked. \"I can't go back home like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a home here.\" Smiling, Viva said. \"Your mom will understand. She fell in love with a golem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can a human and a golem...?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko smiled. \"Golems are magical creatures.\" Calmly, she explained. \"They can become human for a short period of time.\" She shook her head. \"It takes much practice and a lot of energy. Still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love can make anyone do incredible things.\" Appearing in the room, Cecil said. \"Welcome to Monster Manor, Jon Que.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI returned his smile. \"Thank you. I guess this is my home now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecil sighed, noting my sadness. \"We all went though this transition, whether we were born this way or changed by another.\" Serious, he said. \"We will help you adjust.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing I saw, were stars...  Shooting stars.  Millions of them, racing through the portal of darkness.  It was the most beautiful site to behold.  Shimmering emerald, magenta and crimson lights emitted from those stars, were entwining themselves to form one body of intricate rainbow lights, while others zipped towards the 'end' - which was currently blocked from my view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was I?  I just stood there, gaping at the splendour of it all...<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThis was curious.  Was it another dream? Recently, this so-called place had frequently visited my dreams, or my unconscious state of mind.  I wonder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder some unknown impulse, I reached forward and attempted to grab a single shooting star.  I missed, and it shot past me, teasing me for my sluggishness.  Groaning, I rolled my eyes as it disappeared into the distance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whatever</i>, I could always try again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I did.  I lunged forwards this time, and clapped down my fingers on a passing star, before securing tight between my palms.  HA!  GOTCHA!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe star was still bright, very bright, which reminded me of a car on a great load of fuel.  It was one of the newest and brightest stars here.  Perhaps it was my imagination, but it seemed to be struggling, struggling vigorously in my grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME GO!\"  A young girl's voice yelled from the star.  \"LET ME GO THE BEYOND!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I asked, surprised and interested.  \"I have no idea what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm dead.  And I would like my soul to rest in peace,\" the star whispered in melancholy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe star agreed.  \"I just died very recently.  I'm a soul.  I think this is the earliest stage of death.  The limbo. LET ME GO!  I need to pass it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was puzzled.  \"Is everyone here dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the voice whispered sadly.  \"See those bright stars?  We are all newly dead souls, racing towards the beyond, where we can forever rest in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the brighter the star... the more recent the person's death?\" I figured, completely entralled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" the star said.  \"I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTIONS SO LET ME GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" This was all very interesting, but I had to know something.  \"One last thing.  Why am I here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just a poor dead soul,\" the star pouted from beneath my palms.  \"How do expect me to know?  You look rather alive to me, poking your nose into businesses which are not yours.  Now let me head on to the BEYOND!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't ask to be here!\" I snapped, angry now.  \"So am I dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe star seemed to be staring right at me.  \"No, I don't think so,\" she said, awed.  \"Your soul is too bright... I think you're alive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So means I can go back?\" I asked excitedly.  \"I can... well, be alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose,\" the star drawled boredly.  \"If you don't trespass too far into the territory of the dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the star said that, I could feel my surroundings slowly sifting, slowly changing.  Even though I hadn't a clue what was really going on, somehow, deep within me, I knew I was returning to the 'Realm of the Alive' where I truly belonged.  Yes, I was going back!  Finally!  I didn't fancy living among the newly dead any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe star apparently felt it too, because it got frantic, thrashing under my grip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME GO, QUICK! DON'T BRING ME BACK TO THE WORLD! I DON'T WANT TO LIVE AGAIN!  I WANT TO BE FREE IN THE BEYOND!\" It yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I can do that?\" I asked befuddled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe star appeared both urgent and uncertain.  \"I... think so...  You seem capable... I don't know...  I am not too 'into' death yet, I suppose....  But the fact that you're here and alive is a pretty great feat already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, if I could bring you back alive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON\"T YOU DARE!\" The soul screamed a blood curdling cry.  \"LET ME GO ON MY JOURNEY NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis conversation had thoroughly shaken me up.  So apparently, I had suddenly entered 'Death's Realm' in which the dead had to take before they reached this peaceful place called the 'Beyond'.  And according to the star, I had a choice whether to bring her back to the Living, or free her and let her carry on to the Beyond.  It would be amazing!  If what she said was truly reliable, then perhaps I could bring all sorts of people back from the dead!  I could stop my loved ones from dying if I caught them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was scared, but curiosity got the better of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, I didn't feel like freeing this star anymore.  I felt like experimenting.  I felt like replenishing her life, and letting her start anew.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy surroundings were shifting again, even more, at a greater scale.  Soon, I would be back where I was, a normal teenager, in a normal school, with a normal sister and a normal mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before that, I had one decision to make.  A decision which would surely affect my life in many ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree the soul or not to free?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One second I was in the middle of tons of shooting souls, and in the next second, I found myself lying on my back, head whoozy and all.  My eyes fluttered open uncertainly and tried to adjust to my unusually dark surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, where was I again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grimaced in pain as I straightened my legs.  Now, that certainly hurt like mad.  Experimentally, I shifted my leg once more, only to have a nasty electric shock surge through my ankles.  Oh darn, so it was fractured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU IDIOT!\"  A familiar girl's voice screeched from underneath my clenched palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah!\" I gasped.  \"I can't believe- What...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soul cursed me every single nasty word in the dictionary, before yelling, \"AT LEAST LET GO OF ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo stunned to speak, I obediently did as I was told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe star-like soul seemed to leap off my open palm before bursting into an even blindingly bright light, growing larger and larger, till... till it formed a young girl, who looked about a year younger than I was.  I couldn't really see her features in the dark, but I could tell that man, she looked crazily mad.  Mad at me, that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ass!\"  The girl cried out indignantly, before kicking me over and over again at my fractured ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing in pain, I begged, \"Stop! Oww! Stop please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my surprise, she did.  And suddenly, fear flickered across her features.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... brought me back from the dead. I...\"  She inspected herself with shock.  \"I'm alive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...  I'm sorry...\" I apologized uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna forgive you,\" she snapped.  Then she looked to me.  \"So where are we?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My best guess is that we're in a hole.  And a really deep one, I'm guessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Her eyes bulged in disbelief  \"You rob me from my chance to rest in peace and put me in damn hole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do it on purpose,\" I replied in my defense.  \"I fell in here.... by accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe calmed down, before straining her neck upwards trying to estimate the exact height of the hole.  \"So it's Tessa to the rescue again,\" she groaned.  \"Alright, what are you waiting for?  Get onto my back and climb out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat girl named Tessa was blind.  \"If you haven't noticed, my leg is fractured!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oopsies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, an idea struck me.  It required me to be self-sacrificial, but I was willing to risk it.  Besides, it was dark, and there would probably be no search teams out in search of me.  I didn't fancy my chances staying out in the woods all night.  And don't forget, Mom would definitely go nuts if I didn't return tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on my shoulders,\" I told her.  \"Pull yourself out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" She asked me incredulously.  \"Then you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow the path down after you get out,\" I directed her.  \"There's a house at the end.  It's my house.  Inform someone there, and ask them to rescue me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at me thoughtfully for a moment.  \"Alright,\" she agreed finally.  \"Get down on fours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was harder said then done.  Every single tiny movement caused my poor fractured limb to tremble with agony.  But in the end, I succeeded anyway, panting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry!\" I pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa obviously deliberately took her own sweet time to climb onto my back to pay me back from my actions earlier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry!\" I screamed this time.  \"I'm breaking, dammit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cast one scornful look at me and hauled herself out of the hole.  Really, it surprised me that she managed it.  Even on my back, the opening of the hole was more than a head higher than her.  She must have had a lot of hidden muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done,\" she informed me, arrogantly.  \"I'm out.  You alright down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" I gasped.  \"Now go inform them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn evil grin crossed her features.  Uh oh, bad news.  Now what?  Maybe I shouldn't have so readily trusted a dead girl.  Too late to regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On one condition,\" she smiled evilly.  \"You send me back to the Dead where I belong- back to the limbo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAT? I didn't even know how I got in there in the first place!  How'd you expect me to know how to get back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't know how...\" I admitted truthfully.  \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" The girl's smile faded.  \"Sorry to you then.  You're staying down there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turned to leave, before retracing her steps and returning to the entrance of the hole.  \"Please!\" she begged all of the sudden.  \"There's no other way back!  Only you! You have to!  I can't believe I'm stuck with an idiot like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK...\" I said a bit too quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay?\" She asked excitedly.  \"Will you? Will you? Will you send me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know what to say, my mouth felt extremely, extremely dry.  I could send her back, send her back and let her rest in peace in the 'Beyond' where she so wished.  Or I could refuse.  She had no choice, she had to stick around me, and if I died, all her chances of returning would be severed.  She had to keep me alive at all cost.  And I admit it, I did like this girl's company despite her rough demeanour.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then I thought of an unusually mean thought: I could make her serve me.  If I could bring back souls from the dead, I could make them serve me by promising them that I would return them to the dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment I thought it, I immediately mentally slapped myself.  How cruel of me!  How could I?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what? So what now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had the power to agree or refuse, what should I do?</span></div></div>",

The galaxies of shooting stars faded, and the image of a concerned and familiar woman appeared before my vision.  MOM!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen did she come?  But whatever it was, I was happy to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" I croaked weakly.  \"Where... am I?\"  <i>I couldn't be in that hole anymore, right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the hospital, darling,\" My mom replied, before shaking her head and clucking her tongue in disapproval.  \"You had to go take the shortcut through the woods again!\" she yelled all of a sudden.  \"TELL ME WHY?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mental picture of Angry Tessa surfaced before me, and I realized that females did have a lot in common.

It was turquoise from the front, and changed colour dependent on what angle you looked at it from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh... hey Aunty,\" she greeted my Mom politely.  \"Hey...\" she looked at me sourly. \"Hey Jon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's your life-saver Jon!\" Mom thumped in the back, very hard, causing my fractured leg to throb with pain.  \"Don't be rude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Tes- Sarah,\" I mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was extremely awkward.  And what was even more awkward, was the fact that Mom kept staring at Tessa strangely.  Very strangely.  I did want to tell her to stop embarrassing herself, but I just kept quiet instead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be my imagination,\" Mom finally observed.  \"But... you do look familiar... Like someone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa tensed considerably.  I just looked to Mom slightly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it can't be,\" Mom finished.  \"Of course it can't be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can't be?\" I asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom furrowed her brows.  \"Just last night, my friends daughter passed away from Leukemia, cancer...  It had been haunting her for five years already...\" Then she shrugged.  \"I happened to be there at her final moments... She was so brave.  A great fighter, even to the last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessa's face paled as if she had seen a ghost.  \"...\" she tried, but nothing came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought that Sarah just looks a bit like that girl...\" Mom fumbled for her name.  \"Tessa Robinson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Tessa and I glanced at each other nervously.  So... Tessa had died of cancer?  I suddenly felt horrible for bringing her back.  She wasn't very old.  That meant, half her life, she had been fighting cancer.  She probably wanted very badly to reach the beyond and leave this Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oopsies, my bad.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, completely unaware of the tension, broke it cheerfully.  \"Anyway, I have good news for both of you.\" She turned to Tessa.  \"Tessa, as a reward for saving my only son, I shall...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Recently, Wicker had been forced by his mom to wear braces, and within a week, it became some sort of 'fashionable trend' to take after.  And if I recall, two weeks earlier, braces were supposed to be the most degrading sort of metallic device ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the moment Wicker made it a point to 'greet me', it became a new fad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there <i>witchy-girl</i>!\" <i>'Wicked'</i> would call from the other end of the class every morning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his little cronies would echo the same sentence after him.  If you hadn't listened to that for the past three years of your life, you would have thought it was some sort of cheer or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe <i>bastards</i>.  \"Get some new lines!\" I would yell back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a flicker of amusement would appear on his features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat happened everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, I finally plucked up my courage to ask him a question which had been troubling me for the past three years.  How coincidental, for our Biology teacher had forced us to be science partners for some sort of Bunsen Burner experiment.  Alright, I admit it, I was terribly afraid of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, see!\" Wicked exclaimed accusingly.  \"You're doing it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and light the Bunsen Burner,\" I ordered him, having no idea what the hell he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWicked looked me in the eye.  \"Dare you to on the Bunsen Burner, witchy-girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" I bit my lip.  I was so NOT going to admit I was scared of fire.  Not when he was looking at me in such a condescending manner.  \"Errr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knew it!\" He said triumphantly.  \"Witches fear fire!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI feigned a sigh.  \"Always knew you were missing something up there.  I wonder...\"  I pretended to think.  \"Of course! Must be your brain eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignored me.  \"That's why they burnt witches in the past,\" Wicked explained gleefully.  \"Tied them to a stick and fried them with fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFine, I did make a mistake of sharing that I came from a long line of Wiccans for my Elementary School show and tell.  Really, it wasn't my fault.  I just thought that I might be somewhat interesting and fetch me a high grade.  But who knew?  Not only did I barely pass, but next thing I knew, Wicked and his gang had adjusted from not noticing me at all, to labeling me 'witchy-girl'.  Old habits die hard, three years later, he still sticks to the nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done yet?\" I groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for the good part,\" he continued with sadistic excitement.  \"One day, I'm gonna sneak up on you with a cross and BOO-YAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm supposedly good with dealing with annoying guys which come around to bug me daily, but with Wicked, its different.  He completely redefines the meaning of annoying, and totally pisses the hell out of me.  It's amazing, his skills.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then I'll take a bunch of holy water and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHUT UP!  ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH!  I was boiling mad now.  At the moment, I was wishing I was really a witch.  If I were a witch, I would have turned him into a toad there and then.  But unfortunately, I wasn't.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, despite my blind rage, I swore I felt a strange sensation of energy... or power... surge through me.  I felt like I could control everything and anything at my will.  I felt invincible... Hah?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, Wicked looked downright afraid.  Maybe it was just a figment of my imagination.  But he did looked rather unlike himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to explain yourself,\" Wicked suddenly whispered gently.  \"I've always kinda known that...  Besides your witchy green eyes and black hair, you can...  OK.  Admit it, you ain't normal either.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My family has known the Wilds for generations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" I asked incredulously.  \"That doesn't explain anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWicked chewed his lip thoughtfully for a moment.  \"OK, you tell me your secret, and I'll tell you mine,\" He randomly piped out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat secret?  This guy was plain weird.  Maybe his 'secret' explained why he had been picking on me ever since he learnt I had 'Wiccan' blood in my veins according to him.  If that was the case, I would definitely like to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the background, the Biology teacher yelled, \"ON THE BUNSEN BURNER ALREADY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWicked rolled his eyes, winked at me, and switched on the Bunsen burner with a flick of the lighter.  That idiot, he should have done it earlier then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, something else was troubling my mind.  I wondered what secret?</span></div></div>",

That was just him being weird again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, so... <i>star-crossed enemies</i>?\" Wicked piped up hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the #300th time today, I rolled my eyes.  Was it just me, or did I seem to do that a lot around Wicked?  Wicked's retardedness never failed to boost my ego; to make me realize that I'm a normal person despite all my shortcomings; that Wicked was the real mentally unsound patient here.  But... despite his apparent usefulness, he still annoyed the shit out of me, and I still <i>hated</i> him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, I said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the main point,\" I tried to coax him onto 'the-path-of-a-normal-person'.  \"The main point is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flipping Fibonacci!\" Wicked exclaimed excitedly. \"I got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mentally prepared myself to endure something incredibly stupid.  And as it turned out, I was right in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both our families should have dinner together, shake hands, be friends,\" Wicked suggested.  \"And hopefully, that clears the feud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swore my IQ dropped by at least ten points at that.  \"Didn't you just tell me ten seconds ago that our families bear many millenniums worth of grudges?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Germany hated USA (a.k.a us).  But they still had some peace treaty right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, and btw, its called the Treaty of Versailles.  And everyone, besides you, knows that Germany screwed the treaty over and started World War 2 anyway,\" I countered intellectually.  At least I listened in class, unlike Wicked, who apparently had completely no clue of his own country's turbulent history.  In fact, I bet he didn't even know the name of our current President.  That guy only cared about three things: himself, himself, and his Call of Duty video game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" He began to digest the information in bite-sized bits.  \"So the moral of the story is that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-is that: Your crap plan isn't going to work,\" I muttered darkly.  \"Newsflash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople around us had already began filing out of the Chemistry lab.  I gathered my labcoat, pencil case, and worksheets from the table, and removed myself from my seat.  Talking to Wicked only had me learn to things: we were now star-crossed enemies, and that his IQ was lower than I had expected. At this rate, I wasn't going to find out anything about... our clashing families, which of course might cost us our lives later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the beginning, when Wicked had taken a snipe at my 'witchness' as usual, and then suddenly went 'oh, by the way, we're enemies.  Your family consist of witches, and mine of witch-hunters. AND... I'm supposed to kill you'.', I just stared at him like a fish out of water, gaping for breath.  But later on, when he had explained the situation more thoroughly (with me cross-referencing the information with my family background, behaviours and experience), I began to slowly take his word with more than a pinch of salt.  And when I had finished adding sodium hydroxide to the dish of hydrochloric acid, I came to realize that the gravity of the situation was serious, and that this wasn't something to fool around about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when our solution was bubbling, I decided to engage in actual conversation with Wicked - one that didn't include me cussing at him, and him laughing at my expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask you something?\" I asked, just before I left the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to ask it anyway,\" Wicked replied as a matter-of-factly.  \"There's no stopping nerds like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignored him completely.  \"Why didn't you... you know, kill me while you could?\" My mind began to flash to countless of situations where he could have simply finished me off, like the time I sprained my ankle during Physical Education...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't attack girls,\" He replied steadily. \"That's against the manly code of manliness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once in my life, I was glad that Wicked was retarded; glad that he had retarded values; glad that he had a retarded manly code of manliness.  To hide my relief, I said, \"Doesn't your manly code of manliness include not teasing girls too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it did, I'd quit,\" Wicked told me seriously.  \"They can't ban a necessity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes for the third time that morning.  Since his answer wasn't worthy of a reply from me, I soundlessly grabbed my belongings and stomped out of class.</span></div></div>",

We merely do not always see eye to eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why was I not told this earlier?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"The rule of thumb is never to reveal or offer to reveal your secret until you see another using similar powers.\" Kindly, mom replied. \"Brandon must have seen your powers peeking through your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... eyes?\" Curious, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Look in the mirror and see for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked to a full length mirror on a closet door in the laundry room where i had confronted mom and gasped.

Like how something perfectly normal is happening, and something super crazy happens right afterwards. Well, my story is kind of like that, only difference is that there's a bigger emphasis on the term \"crazy\". You could say that something happened to me. Something that completely changed my world point of view. And believe me, it's never gonna be the same again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started on that day. It was the beginning of summer, where I woke up around 9 a.m. or so in the morning. I live with my mom and dad, along with Scott, my little brother, and my dog Rex. Although Scott seems to have a habit of calling him Rexxy, I'm sure it's perfectly normal. He's only like 6 or something. Anyway, I woke up to the sound of my alarm clock, which I've gotten used to setting every night. I said good morning to Rex, who I always keep in my room. He's a healthy Labrador Retriever, in case you were wondering. And of course, he barked up at me and gave my face a bath with his tongue. I was on my way to the shower for a real bath when I started feeling a little itchy. It wasn't anything bad, because it felt like one of those occasional itches that everyone gets every once in a while. But the thing was, wherever I scratched, it came back somewhere else. I wasn't really worried or anything, but I hurried a little to the shower, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was bathing, I was really relieved to find the itch was gone. Maybe Rex was starting to get flees? Hope not. Bathing him is a real hassle. Anyway, funny thing about what happened while I was shampooing my hair. I couldn't help but notice my hair seemed a little longer than I remember when I went to bed last night. It was weird, I admit, or maybe it's just a case of a faulty memory? Nah. After my shower, I was brushing my teeth to get rid of that morning breath. That was when I found something that started to creep me out a little. It was my teeth. My canines, to be exact. They were a little longer, and maybe even a little more pointed than before. Or maybe it was just the mirror playing tricks on me. Yeah, that's gotta be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I still can't help but feel that something was really off about me today. It could just be my serves, since I've been so excited for summer vacation this year. I went back to my room to spend a little play time with Rex before breakfast. And that was when I knew that something really weird is going on around here. When I opened the door, Rex bounded up to me like he always does, but then he stopped right in front of me. That's never happened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's wrong Rex?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't move. He didn't even reply in anyway. No bark, no growl, no yelp, no nothing. He just stood there with his tail between his legs, like he was...Afraid of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rex? What's the matter? It's me, Tom! Your friend, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to get a little closer, and he suddenly ran under the bed. I was starting to panic a little bit, but I tried to keep a calm face the whole time. I had to lie down to see him under the bed, cowering in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rex! It's me, Tom! Please come out! You're starting to scare me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to find someway to make him come out. Rex has never done anything like this before, ever! I went to my table, where I would always keep his favorite chew toy on top of it. When I grabbed it, I saw something even weirder. I keep a hand mirror on the side of the table, and the reflection was what I found weird. In case you're wondering, I got that mirror as a birthday present from one of my aunts, okay? Anyway, I picked up the mirror and saw myself, only it didn't seem like myself to me. My hair was longer by at least half an inch, my canines were even sharper, and worst of all, were my eyes. They didn't seem human anymore. My pupils were slits, like an animal's! Now I know why he was afraid of me! It was because I don't even look like myself anymore! My first thought was to find the reason why I was turning into this...thing, but first thing's first. I have to convince Rex that I'm still me. I rushed back to my bed and held out the chew toy, making sure that my face was out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Rex, I've got your favorite chew toy! Come on, I won't hurt you, I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, I wasn't sure that this was gonna work, but he slowly came out and saw me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid Rex. It's me, Tom. I won't hurt you, and I never will, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sniffed my hand a little before he took the toy out of my hand. I petted him a bit, just to help make him feel better. It took a few minutes before he was convinced that I was still myself. I felt glad for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for scaring you like that. I don't know what happened. But I'm gonna look for an answer, and everything will be back to the way it was. Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licked my face a couple times and hugged me. I definitely needed that. Little did I know that everything won't be going back to normal that easily. What happened next was a knock at my door, which I really hated, since I was having a moment with my dog here. Anyway, it was...</span></div></div>",

He just sat there on the edge of the bed and looked at me in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, I think it's about time I told you something about my side of the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, I was pretty surprised that he was perfectly calm with all of this. I just sat up and listened to what he told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Tom, my side of the family isn't what you would call normal. You see, it's a little hard to explain, but...Well, our bloodline contains latent werewolf blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...Did you just say werewolf blood? As in those man-eating monsters of the night werewolves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but that description's actually a little stereotypical. You see, every generation gives birth to a werewolf child, but only the first born receives this gift. These people will begin to turn into their true forms once they come of age. My guess is it's about your time now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight. We have an entire family who's first borns, including me, are all werewolves!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right son. Your mother already knows this, so you don't have to hide it from her. But try not to scare your brother, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-dad! What am I gonna do!? This means that I'm gonna turn into a snarling, blood-thirsty monster every full moon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now calm down. That's just another movie stereotype the media invented. You keep all of your memories and sanity while you're transformed, and you don't need a full moon to transform either. You can actually change no matter what time of the day it is, but you will change on full moon nights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how do you know all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, I lived with my older brother for years until I moved out, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, uncle Daniel. No wonder his Halloween costume was so scary two years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, see? There's nothing to worry about Tom. Once your body has finished changing, you'll learn to turn back human soon afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dad. I'm really glad you explained all this to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hugged him, thinking about what he told me, and he hugged me back. When we broke, my dad told me that I can have breakfast in bed, just for today so I don't have to see Scott and accidentally scare him. As he closed the door, Rex jumped up on to me. I was glad he wasn't scared of me. I petted him a bit more, when my hands started getting all twitchy. I looked at them as these patches of hair...Fur...Whatever were growing on it! The hair, I mean fur, was a darkish brown in colour, and they were slowly spreading up to my wrists! Not only that, but my fingernails were growing longer and sharper, growing over my fingertips and making them look like claws! I looked at my palms as parts of them, along with this side of my fingers, were turning black and leathery, like the foot pads of a dog! The changes suddenly stopped at my wrists. My forearms were still human, but it looked like I had wolf paws for hands! Well, I'm not really sure if I can call them paws, because I still have opposable thumbs. I looked back at Rex, sitting in front of me. He wasn't scared really, but more like...Um, concerned is the closest word I can think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Rex. Once this is all over, I can just change back into the Tom you used to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nuzzled my head a little as I stroked his back. I was really hopeful that this wasn't going to take too long to finish. I just wanted my old life back...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I laid back on my bed as Rex sat next to me. I was thinking on what I should do next, until I heard mom open the door and carry a stack of pancakes inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, I heard from your father that you're finally growing up! So, I brought your breakfast up here, so you won't scare your brother.\" mom said, setting the pancakes on by desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh, thanks mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just looked at the pancakes and I felt my stomach gurgle, the yummy scent filling my mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father also said that your body will need a lot of energy when transforming, so you'll be hungrier than usual. That's why I made a few extras for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI merely nodded as I kept eying the food. Mom gave me a knife and fork she brought up with her before I began chowing down. And man, was it delicious! In fact, I just kept scarfing everything down! It was just so good, and before I know it, I was already done. I looked at the empty plate, then back to mom, looking at me sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, where were your manners!?\" she said with an angry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Sorry?\" I said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright then. But I expected you to at least slow down. You could've choked on it, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, she cleaned up my mess and headed back downstairs. I just blinked as I though about what mom just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Strange, was I really that hungry? Rex, I wasn't that crazy, was I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Rex, who just curled around on my bed, watching me. I shrugged my shoulders as I stood up, wanting to stretch a bit. I walked up to the door and looked around. No one outside my room. That's good. I looked at the door frame, then felt a powerful urge to scratch it. So, I did. It was just a tiny little scratch, something no one would notice. But then, I just started scratching it more and more, and my claw marks were becoming more pronounced each time. It felt good for some reason, leaving my mark outside my door. That way, everyone would see it. They will know that this room is mine. My territory, my property...I just kept scratching that one spot, until my claw marks were clearly defined on the door frame. I felt proud about my work, until I heard someone coughing. It felt like I woke up from a daze, only to see my dad standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you've marked your territory, son.\" he said, looking at the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at it myself, and for the first time realized what I just did. I felt ashamed, making a huge mark on the door frame like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-dad! I can explain!\" I said quickly, but I really had no explanation to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay son, I understand. Your wolf senses are starting to come out. It's only natural for you to mark your territory. You'll begin acting like this more and more as you transform, and you'll learn to cope with them afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad just gave me a warm smile as he inspected the damage I did. I still felt a little guilty, but knew I couldn't fix it. I sighed as I just went back to my room and laid down next to Rex. I looked down at my pajama legs and realized that my feet have changed the same way my hands did. Did it happen while I was clawing at the door? Oh well, I just hope that it'll end soon.</span></div></div>",

And the next thing I knew, Rex was licking my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rex, leave me alone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I realized I fell asleep, I sat upright on my bed. I looked at the clock, seeing that it was already noon. I slept for an extra 3 hours this morning! I got up and stretched again, wondering what I should do. Rex was whining at me, which must mean that he needed to go use the tree outside. So I opened my bedroom door, and he ran out immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Rexxy, where are ya goin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Scott, my little brother! Why he was upstairs is beyond me, though. Usually, he's downstairs watching TV. I closed the door and took a good look at myself. Other than the changes that have happened already, nothing seemed to have changed. That was until I checked my face, and found out I have brown fur all over me from the neck down. I look like I grew a beard of fur!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tom! Aren't we going out today? Come on, you promised!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no, I remembered! I promised my little bro that we'd go to the park on the first day of summer, which is today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...*cough* S-sorry Scott, but...Ugh, I don't feel so good.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Well, okay then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard his footsteps moving away, and I was glad...Wait, I heard his footsteps? I pulled my hands up to my ears, and felt that they were pointed now! And there was some fur growing all over it, and they were moving up my head too! They stopped on top of my head, so I now had wolf ears! I can't believe the changes were happening this fast. For one, I am glad that they don't hurt at all. So far, the worst thing that's happened is that they itch a little. I scratch my chest, feeling another itch there. But my hands felt fur underneath my clothes, which must mean that my whole body is covered in fur now! I think the last thing to change would be my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just laid on my bed, waiting for the change to come, but it didn't. I looked outside my window, seeing a number of people pass by my house for personal reasons. I sighed, waiting for my still-human face to change. I then heard footsteps outside my door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, I wanna play!\" Scott said from beyond the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Scott! I told you, I don't feel good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound fine to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could reply, the door handle turned as Scott stepped into my room. He looked at me, and just stared at me. Then, my face started to tingle. I pull a hand/paw up and feel fur growing over it, covering it. Then my mouth and nose pull forward, forming a snout on my face. My teeth even feel weird, like they're changing too. And right then and there, I was done. Scott just stared at me, obviously surprised at what he's seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...So...Y-yeah...\" was all I could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a werewolf? That's so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott suddenly runs up to me and starts asking me stuff like how did I get bit, or if it hurt, and other questions I didn't quite catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, Scott. Stop. Stop!\" I said, holding my hands out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where's your tail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe suddenly heard this ripping sound, so I looked behind me to see my new wolf tail sticking out of a ripped hole from my pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I wonder how I'm gonna explain this to mom and dad.\" I said.</span></div></div>",

How does having a tail feel like? I honk it would be pretty cool.\" Scott says with a smile. I look on him happily and say, \"It eels reird Scrott.\" Hmm, that didn't sound right. A little worried, I rushed to the bathroom, noting that I was hunching over, almost like I was ready to run on all fours. When I saw my face in the bathroom mirror, I saw the reason my speech was a little warped. My mouth was becoming a muzzle, and my tongue was a little longer and a bit rougher. I said a few more words to see how warped my speech would be once the change was complete. \"Heroh? Ry ame ris Tome. Ry ron't hur' rou.\" Heh, seems the cartoons got at least one thing right. If a dog or a wolf can speek the human tongue, some of the words will either have a letter taken off, or a letter added on, mostly r's. Luckily, I could understand myself pretty clearly. When I came out, I saw Scott petting Rex. \"Ah, hello Tom, dear chap. Thank you so very much indeed for letting me out to, how you say, escort Elvis out of the building, hmm? And it seems you are becoming a werewolf. Oh I heard you and your father's conversation yesterday. A fine being indeed, strong, noble, and quite the scholar.\" A voice said. I was confused. It didn't sound like Scott. \"Rey Scrott, rhy are ya talkring 'Ike rhat?\" I said in my slurred speech. \"But Tom. I didn't say nothin'.\" Scott said innocently. Hmm then who was it? Not a moment later, I got my answer. \"Down here, ol' boy. Surprised, hmm? Don't be. You are an animal. I wager it is safe to say that wether you masquerade as a wolf or a human you can understand any species. Now I can finally have a middle man to start conversation with the rest of the family. Of course, your father could understand me, but that's because he has both wolf blood and is at least 27. Don't ask me why that's the magic number, ask your old man's mother. Now, you seem to be looking for your parents, yes? Come, I shall take you to them.\" Rex says rambling a bit. I was shocked to say the least. I half expected to be able to understand animals, but I was a bit surprised when I heard Rex speek like a perfect English gentleman, er gentledog. Scott and I looked at each other, shrugged, and followed Rex. When Rex stopped, we were standing in front of...</span></div></div>",

Rex faced us and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here we are, chaps. I trust that you will strike up conversation with your mother, so I will leave you to it. Fare well, ol' boys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex then walked away, heading to the back door. Scott ran to mom's side and tugged at her sleeve, trying to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Mom! Tom is a werewolf! He looks cool, but he's started talking weird!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as mom turned her attention to him and listened to his words before setting the dish down on the sink and turning to face me. I kinda expected her to scream, or at least jump a little, but she kept a perfectly straight face when she saw me. When I think about it, maybe it's from experience being with my dad's family. Either way, she smiled when she saw me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Tom! You look like you've finished changing. How are you, dear? Tired? Hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my stomach grumble lightly. I placed a hand on it as I turned to the wall clock, which showed that it was nearing one o'clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ry'm gretting a rittle rungry.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll set up some lunch for you. Just sit at the table, it'll be ready in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat down, I saw dad walk in, briefcase in hand and putting a necktie on. He looked like he was in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, honey. Gotta go to work. Boss said Jay called in sick, so I gotta fill in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear, I thought we were going to enjoy some family time today. You called in for a day off, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well unexpected things happen sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI roll my eyes at that comment. I would say my transformation is something beyond 'unexpected'. He turned his eyes to me, then looked at me from top to bottom. He smiled as he patted me on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Tom! You're finished changing! How does it feel?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rell, it freers kinda rierd, bein' arr fruffy, rand my tairl! Rit needs gerting rused to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I can understand what you said, but you kinda need to practice talking again. I called Daniel to come by and give you werewolf lessons. You've been given a new, unique body, Tom. I just hope my brother can guide you in using it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad ruffled my hair...Fur...Head fur before he gave mom a kiss on the cheek and headed out the door. Scott smiled as he sat beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Dan is coming? This is gonna be great, huh Tom!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at the thought. Uncle Daniel, or Uncle Dan as he liked to be called, was really great. He enjoyed telling stories about history with his own little twist, he always carried sweets in his pocket so he always gave us some when he comes to visit, and he loves horror movies! Okay, that last one isn't really all that great, but he always seems to pick the ones with werewolves in it. Learning that he was the werewolf of his family seemed to explain it. Anyway, Scott and I were excited with the news that he'll be coming over to visit! Well, it was to teach me on being a werewolf, but still!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Tom, I made quiche!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom came in with a whole quiche in her hands. She set it down in front of me, and I couldn't help but drool at it. Mom makes the best quiche! She began cutting it up with a knife and handed Scott a slice. He began eating as she cut me a slice too. I begin eating, and it was delicious! One thing I noticed is that the flavor seems stronger for some reason. I thought about it as I munched, thinking it could be my enhanced wolf senses. Anyway, I finished off about three slices when Scott managed to finish eating his one slice. I felt a bubbling in my stomach as it traveled up my throat. As it reached my mouth, I let out a loud burp, not long, just loud. My mom looked at me expectantly as I placed a furry hand over my muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excruse me.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom smiled as she took the rest of the quiche and placed it in the fridge. I rubbed my stomach as Scott watched me. I looked at him, and he just stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scrott?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry! I just thought that, if I looked away or blinked, I might wake up. But I guess I'm not really dreaming, am I? Hahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just laughed along with him as we both sighed and headed into the living room. Scott took the remote and turned the TV on. Typical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tom, maybe you should practice talking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded as I began saying random sentences. Scott just watched TV while I tried saying tongue twisters slowly. Actually, though I did kinda understand what I was saying, it sounded a lot like gibberish when I said it. And I mean a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thish irsh gronna take shome gettin' rushed too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang. I looked at the front door, then retreated into the kitchen.

Blue eyes that all the boys would gaze into. Not anymore. Not after what happened over spring break my junior year. I remember every detail of it, as if it were yesterday...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<i>Athens, Greece. A school-sponsored trip, and I wasn't complaining. Even though I'd taken Ancient Mythology on a whim, I never thought I'd end up here. In fact, perhaps it would have been better if I hadn't, in hindsight. Because the opportunity for destruction presented itself, and I was all too willing to accept. But that's not the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was really hot, that morning. Sweat poured off me, dripping in every crevice. Everyone sweltered under the heat, except our tour guide. Born and raised on the sea. Not much older than I was, too. He was only nineteen, it wasn't a crime. A few furtive glances, and we were sharing drinks off the same water bottle. I liked to wrap my shirts then, up high to show off my waist. He always offered to help me tie my shirt up, and sometimes his hands wouldn't just make knots in the fabric. They steamed worse than the sun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur journey was drawing to a close. The day it happened, everyone had left for the beach. Leaving me and him behind for a \"private history lesson\". We hadn't hit the big monuments, after all. So in we went to a quiet little temple, currently closed for renovations. As if it mattered to us...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing I remember was reaching the temple stairs. I looked straight up into the eyes of Athena, and laughed. He didn't waste time examining the statue, however, and focused his intentions instead on working his hands over a different kind of sculpture. I didn't stop him. I was naive. Who was I to imagine the consequences of youth and passion in such a sacred place? It was my first kiss, after all, sweet and sticky and amazing. I begged for more, and he obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could have been minutes, hours, days for all I cared. He sent me to Mount Olympus and back, to use a cliche. Every breath a new rush of sensation, and I couldn't help it. I gave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKind of funny, then, what happened next. As he gazed deep into my eyes, my deep blue eyes, I watched his expression change from desire to repulse. His intentions turned from amorous to fearful. He pulled away, of course, and I foolishly chased after him. Little did I realize the towering statue behind me had suddenly taken to glaring at him. Her eyes darted to me, of course. I only barely recollect the moment, but my world was entirely changed. As was his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was lucky, my first victim. They say he recovered a month or so later. At least it was only paralysis. The next few victims weren't so fortunate as he...</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They just figured the tour guide had called in sick. A few of the girls were disappointed, but nothing more was said on the matter. Nobody cared anymore. Some of them asked me where I'd been; with no trouble I assured them that I'd been at the beach, too. The sad truth of humanity, people will believe anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy superstitious roommate, however, knew the better. I'd been an idiot and gabbed about my secret rendezvous with the guide all the night before. She lost trust in me, moved out of the room before I'd even returned for the night. Better for her, then. Her paranoia actually saved her from the terror to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWord to the wise: If some little ordinary things seems off, it is. How I wish I'd followed that one. Coming back in from the bright day, my eyes burned something awful. So I thought it was the light... Migraine medication and a pair of cheap sunglasses later, and the pain somewhat subsided. Never mind that a chunk of my hair washed out in the shower. Never mind that I took to scratching at my face, peeling off what I assumed was sunburn. The day proved stressful enough to numb my awareness. I just wanted to sleep, be done with the day.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It wasn't so bad. Perhaps I'm exaggerating a bit when I describe the change as terrible, horrific, even <b>monstrous</b>. Those first few days were uneventful after the night aforementioned. Yeah, my skin was red as a tomato, and yes, my hair was dissolving away. Of course I had to wear sunglasses all hours of day and night. But each morning, I'd wake up feeling great again, surprisingly. My hair grew back thicker, stronger, and in tight curls. They circled my head in a serpentine fashion and seemed to have a mind of their own. I could have sworn they were turning green, too. Sometimes I'd find yellowed strands of blond, and other times twinges of red. I figured it was the chlorine from the hotel's pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, right. Did I mention I now felt a strange connection to water? I swam at least six times a day. The other girls joined me often enough, but around about midnight I started to draw looks. I never wanted to stop, either. If I wasn't sleeping or eating, I was \"drowning\" my troubles in the pool. The staff called me \"sea-demon\" out of jest, what for my sunburnt skin and discolored hair. I didn't mind the teasing, at first. I was strong from years of slander back at school. Being a pretty blonde draws a lot of attention, both positive and negative. At least I never have to deal with that label anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody ever roomed with me again. The teacher overlooked that fact in her nightly check-ups. To tell the truth, I think she was afraid of me, too. She had the same sort of intuition about the situation that my roommate did, and thus kept to herself around me. I hadn't a clue why, back then. I just figured it was the same as always, I was too pretty, and thus made people jealous or suspicious of my every action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip ended within the week, my skin still crispy, my hair turning bizarre, unnatural shades. I wore my sunglasses, and tried to blend in with the rest of my tanned companions. None of them matched my blazing scarlet, of course. It wouldn't get any better or bearable on the home front...</i></span></div></div>",

Within moments of stepping inside, Mom had me soaking in a tub and scrubbing off more dead skin. I almost smiled when I noticed a regular shade returning to my flesh. Somewhat regular, compared to red, a golden-brown glow. In Mom's eyes, it was just a bad tan. I couldn't explain to her why I hadn't taken off my glasses, either. Every sort of light burned them. Though this would calm down after recovery from an unfortunate head cold, I continued to wear them out of fear, inspired out of a ghastly dream. It was, of course, the recollection of my episode in the temple. The image of my victim's face frozen in my mind whenever I removed those glasses. Therefore, twenty-four hours a day, those glasses stayed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't notice how bitter and irritable I'd become, too. I'd hiss at my mom when she asked me to do anything, and took to lashing out at Sean. Mom would blame herself, or Dad, or even demons. I saw a psychiatrist once; he didn't do a thing either. I sensed dread in him, too, the same as my former roommate and my teacher. Those looks became commonplace out in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd whereas I couldn't swim as much as I had in Greece, I happily adjusted to bathing three times a day. Mom would holler at me for hogging the hot water, but I scared her off with my venomous demeanor. I made enemies out of my family.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nThe morning I remember most, after a week of this constant anger at home, was the first day back at school. Nobody had spoken with me since the trip, and it'd be my first time back in public (discounting the psychiatrist visit). This was a day as momentous as the day I decided to fool around in a sacred temple, the second turning point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really started to hate life after this.</i></span></div></div>",

What it feels like to think, \"Hey, I have to return to everyone in the town and have them stare down my every pore.\" The inherent vomiting that follows. It's natural, especially for a girl my age. What's not natural is waking up that same morning and not being able to look in the mirror to figure it out. What's also not natural is waking up to ruddy skin that feathers like scales, hair that screams herpetarium-meets-punk-star, and a cold, dead look. I couldn't face anyone like this. No one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell did I do to deserve this? Besides, y'know, have sex in a sacred temple. I only wanted to have some fun, and now I was suffering the torturous consequences. Most girls worry about zits, and I'm worrying about my more-than passing resemblance to the Fly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, like any girl my age who's got something to hide, I attempt to resort to my second best friend-- cosmetics. Oodles of body lotion, scrubs, foundation, moisturizer, conditioner, and even bronzer later, and I'm starting to resemble something human. I coat my face in enough blush to put \"working girls\" to shame. I don't even dare approach my eyes, and instead opt for some clunky sunglasses to hide the spots I can't reach. Longsleeves and pants cover the rest; it's luckily cold enough to justify the attire. On the safe side, I pick a wide fluffy scarf, thick socks and gloves to finish the look. To the passing bystander, I probably look awkward, but nowhere near otherworldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just have to hope everything stays together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI barely eat anything, I'm so nervous. The bus arrives as usual, and I'm cramped next to a portly guy. He's munching down on his breakfast, and notices I'm staring him down. I couldn't help it, the guy was more repulsive than me. So he snaps off a \"What are you lookin' at?\" and goes back to his food. That's the last human contact I got all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody recognized me in my head to toe wrap-up. I was glad for that. Of course, gossip about the trip didn't escape my ears. Everybody seemed to wonder where I'd gone, and rattled off the same tale about my tragic accident. Baloney, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't have any trouble with classes until fourth hour. Mr. Percy, the one teacher who hated my guts, had it out for me once he called the roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summers, Susan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I had to stand up, because he couldn't hear me, or see me. Instant ostracising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to explain why you have not taken off your winter clothes, Ms. Summers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cold in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hats are not allowed indoors, you know school policy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cocked his head to the side, a direct challenge. I could not help but comply. After all, resisting would only bring it down worse upon me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock and awe of my new curls was somehting I expected. What I didn't expect is when Mr. Percy came over, snatched my hat, and apparently snagged his finger on something small and pointy. He went back with a tiny bleeding and a hurt ego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't say I was sorry, in all honesty. It was his fault for coming near my hair. It did have a mind of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the day wasn't over yet.</i></span></div></div>",

I didn't make friends in school, at least not with girls. I had plenty of guys willing to hang out with me, anytime. Therefore my reputation as the local whore had finally caught up to me, and I guess in a very direct way, this was punishment.

From the mildly reflective stall door, I thought myself beautiful, possibly. Without a doubt, I was ready for the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made sure to put my glasses back on, of course.

I held back a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, set, go!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe plunged head first into the crystal clear pool, bolting through the water like a knife through butter.

Any traces of that beautiful spring tan finally shook away to reveal my new metallic scales. The light in my eyes filtered in with a jaundiced tint, my pupils thinning out to distort my perspective in a convex fashion.

I couldn't walk without legs, and the molded tail eliminated any hope of that, or so I thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA masked doctor accompanied my regular guards at the pool's edge. I scoffed at him. He showed the same distaste for me. He also had a bag full of needles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Free heroin injections?' I wondered. He didn't have the same sense of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your arm, Ms. Summers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI refused. I didn't want him sticking anything like that in my arm. Especially when I didn't know what the consequences would be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you would give me your arm, Ms. Summers, we do not have all day. This injection will become routine to you, soon enough. Make haste, we will have you out of this pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then did it occur to me. Just as he stuck the fat needle in the crook of my arm. The ruddy liquid burned in my veins, boiling my cold blood. The flow traveled the length of my body, trickling to the tips of my fingers, the lines of my belly, and finally the curves of my thighs. I hadn't even begun to know pain before that moment when it hit the tip of my tail. I cried in agony, and the doctor merely stiffened my arm out and the two guards held me in place. The vigorous and excruciating second transformation began, and I was helpless to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to pass out badly, just as I had in the pool at school and my own private cell. But, nature would not allow it; I had to suffer through the split of my tail into two tenderly human legs. The rest of me followed suit, peeling away scales to show regular old skin, and my hair even growing an inch of honest blond again. The hissing curls died down into flat, empty hair. But I knew this was all a facade. I wasn't any more human than I had been a second ago, but this needle full of I don't know what masked my true form in the transfiguration of my former self. And why did I know? The guards still refused to look me in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was escorted into the Briefing room, where I would \"meet\" my sponsor. I use the term sponsor in place of the long and complicated Greek term I was offered. Both name the same position: my new babysitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a kindly looking woman, apart from the eyes. I could have buried myself in those black pits of nothingness. She wasn't susceptible to my unfortunate talents, which is exactly why we made such a pair. I'm glad to have met her now, in retrospect. I thank her every day for my early lessons, before I was wise enough to understand what I had become. She offered me all the answers she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Sarah Summers. I am to be your new guardian. You may call me Lucia, if you like. I will assist you in the Redemption process, if you are willing to cooperate. Oh, and please take a seat, if you haven't already. I know my appearance can be quite shocking, or so I'm told. But then again, you're no stranger to bizarre looks, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer laughter felt out of place. I didn't want to join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let us begin, then? What questions do you have for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI asked her cautiously, \"What is this whole deal? Why am I being punished? What's happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will answer to the best of my abilities, but you may not care for my responses. You, Sarah Summers, are the victim of a cruel fate. For your sinful indulgence in the Temple, the Goddess has chosen to have you cursed with your current state. You are undoubtedly aware by now that you have begun the arduous transformation into a Gorgon, have you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Gorgon? I barely knew what one was at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I forget that children may not be as familiar with the old myths. A Gorgon, my dear, is a sea demon, particularly known for her gaze that turns people to stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething troubled me about her statements; \"I've just begun the transformation, you say? But I have a tail, and scales. Snakes in my hair, even!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor, poor darling. You have it so easy right now. It will get worse, I'm sorry to say. At least you aren't as unlucky as the others who've insulted the Goddess. Some of them don't get the honor of Redemption. I assume your age has much to do with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm a Gorgon, and I'm in for a world of pain. But tell me this, who in the world are you people? Who is this Goddess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear girl... We are the agents of the Gods themselves, and the Goddess whom I serve is the one you call Athena. And despite your crimes against her, she has chosen you to become one of her agents as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I didn't want that, not at first. I didn't want anything to do with the 'Goddess' who'd turned me into a monster. I wanted out of it, and I didn't care whether that was human or Gorgon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be her agent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In time you will, my dear Sarah, in time you will. We will commence our next interview within the week, I'm afraid I must attend to the other internees at the moment. Good day, Sarah Summers. Behave yourself, and all may be well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cryptic responses I received from Lucia didn't put my mind at ease, not at all.</i></span></div></div>",

The students who had crossed his path had said he had a heart of stone with no leniency when it came to the rules. \"Mr. Stone...\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can relax, Sarah.\" said Max, calmly. \"I know why you are wearing shades and why you can't tell anyone.\" he sighed, turning around, then shocked me by turning into stone! I opened my mouth to scream but I was surprised again when he walked around his desk. \"You can take your shades off now, young lady. You can't effect what is already stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, and in shock, I removed my sunglasses and watched as  a smile formed onto Max's face. \"I am what one may call a gargoyle, or a living statue.\" he said. \"You are slowly becoming a being similar to Medusa in Greek mythology.\" he paused, sighing. \"You're not the only person fell to temptation in the ancient temples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any way to change myself back?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax gave me a sad look. \"I've been trying to answer that question for twenty years now.\" he replied, to my tears. \"I can help you deal with this, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" I asked, tears falling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax handed me a pair of glasses. \"These are joke glasses, they'll give you a mirrored look at the world around you.\" he explained. \"It will do the same for those who look into your eyes, a Medusa's reflection can not harm anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took the glasses and put them on as Max them returned to his normal flesh state.

Living in Los Angeles with my family and going to Middle School with my friends. I've got a brother and 2 sisters. The brother is Andy who is 9 year old. The sister is Emma who is 8 years old. They sometimes annoy me but that is what siblings do sometimes. My other sister is Sandra who is 21 years old and in college right now. Don't see her often anymore, but she's nice and pays visits when she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyhoo, it's May right now and I'm nearing the end of 8th grade. I'll be in High School next year. Great (sighs). Well, it's a part of life I guess. All I can do is.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY JAMES, WAKE UP!!!\" yelled a high feminine voice as I felt my bed rock. No doubt it was Emma, who considered herself to be my personal alarm clock. I groaned at this. It was always the same with my dear sister. Soon enough, she was jumping on my bed, making it wobble from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Emma, I'm up!\" I said, getting her attention. Emma giggled and got down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom says you have to get up. You've got school right?\" asked Emma. I sighed as Emma finally left my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same old, same old\" I said as I reluctantly got out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next you ask? Well.....</span></div></div>",

It was kind of inbetween if that makes any sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what's up with me?\" I asked myself as I bent down, trying to catch my breath. It was almost like I couldn't breathe for a while. It was like my whole body was acting all messed up today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the lack of breath was because I was suddenly feeling weaker, as if my muscles and build were beginning to shrink and lose energy or something. As I bent down on the ground, it was almost as if the room was slightly getting bigger or something. However, that couldn't be real right? People don't just shrink like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, I was able to breathe lightly again. With that, I stood up and looked around. Nothing seemed too out of the ordinary, although I did still feel a little small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'm just losing it\" I concluded as I did still have a little headache to go with this. What a fun way to start the say huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Emma entered my room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey James, can you come to my room for a sec?\" she asked politely. I figured that I might as well. I was a little curious as to what has her so excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I guess\" I replied, which made her smile. With that, she grabbed my hand and walked me to her room. I just went along with it even though I felt wierd with her dragging me like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, we reached her room and we both went inside. Emma's room was pretty standard for a girl her age which I guess is explanation enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she went to her dresser and got something off of the top of it.

I imagine that it was Emma, my sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" I gritted through my clenched teeth. I was still down on the ground, gripping my aching stomach. In a way, it was almost as if it was trying to become more compact in size. My stomach I mean. It was like it was trying to shrink, and other organs and bones around it were trying to shrink as well. I didn't really get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 5 minutes or so, the discomfort finally vanished. \"Finally\" I said, exasperated. I was able to stand up and get my bearings. After pulling up my shirt, I took a look to see if my waist was still the same. Well, I found out that it wasn't. It seemed to be considerably thinner than usual and the stomach area seemed to be much flatter. It was almost like one of those flat stomachs you see female models with and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's crazy right?\" I asked myself. Maybe I was just hallucinating or something. I didn't know. It wasn't like there was some kind of magic that changed me. There's no such thing as magic. At least, I had no reason to believe that it did exist. I had seen no evidence of it. Then again, the fact of the matter was that I was considerably thinner now. What should I make of that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right at that moment, Emma decided to barge into my room with something in hand.</span></div></div>",

Emma and I genuinely got along much better than most brothers and sisters. That was a pretty good thing we had going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Emma, what is it?\" I asked. Emma then handed me the necklace that she brought with her. \"Please try it on.\" she told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" was my simple reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see how it looks on you\" she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed to that, Emma was very hard to argue with sometimes. Reluctantly, I hooked the necklace on around my neck. As the cold metal touched my skin, it was as if a shock wave had gone through my skin. It was so weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" asked Emma, her eyes dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice\" I replied, if only to please her. Emma giggled and jumped up and down. \"Great, can you come with me then to my room?\" she asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly nodded and she grabbed my hand, pulling me along. I really needed to learn how to control her at times. It wasn't too long before she pulled me into her room and ran towards the window. I looked out there and saw the centaur statue that we had in our backyard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, we owned a ranch someways from here. Our family had a bit of a belief in the Roman legends. With that in mind, we had the centaur statue put there for good luck. Emma especially liked it. She loved horses and our ranch and I loved watching her be happy. However, she now had a somewhat sad look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bad people are planning to take our ranch away. They say that we don't have enough money\" said Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had never heard of that although it made sense. We didn't have the necessary funds to keep it going right now. It was in dire straits. It was time for that statue to work its magic as they say. Although, nothing had happened yet. However, Emma seemed to brighten up somewhat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is going to be okay, big brother.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned, trying to ignore the slight pain in my stomach still lingering from earlier. \"Oh? How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked the centaur girl to send us help.\" said Emma. \"She smiled at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She... smiled at you?\" I asked, slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When a centaur girl smiles, she can help.\" said Emma. \"That is when I found the necklace.\" she beamed as she then added, \"It hanging on your bedroom door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope your wish comes true.\" you said, honestly. \"I really do, Emma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you walked away, scratching your chest. \"Man, what is wrong with me today?\"</span></div></div>",

You needed to take a look at this. Without another thought, you ran into the family room where no one was right now. Your mom was already at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting into the family room, you lifted up your shirt and you were surprised. It was almost like your skin was really irritated, like you had an allergy or something.

I knew it was just a dream, but sitting up let me know that I had changed in my sleep. I got up and walked into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing and locking the bathroom door, I began taking off my clothes. Taking my shirt off, I saw my breasts. I turned this way and that, looking at their shape, wondering what size bra I needed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off my pants and my underwear, I spread my legs and looked at my reflection. No doubt about it: I was now a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat fact didn't fill me with terror, the way changing into a girl had all day. Now that I was completely a girl, I was okay with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle hands knocked on the door, followed by a chorus of voices asking, \"James, are you okay?\" <i>Two different questions,</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting my shirt back on, since that was long enough to cover my naughty bits, I opened the door. \"I'm okay, guys,\" I told them, \"but, from now on, call me Julie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Julie's a girl's name,\" Andy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is,\" I confirmed. \"But I'm a girl now, so I should have a girl's name.\" Turning to Emma, I asked, \"Are there any clothes where you found the shoes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring me some, would you, please?

The rest of her digestive system and her reproductive system are in her barrel. I would recommended that we wait for her to reach adulthood before shoeing her. Overall, I would say that she appears to be healthy.

Then, I would get my hair wet, while Mom did the same to my tail. Both got washed with horse shampoo. Then, I would brush my hair, while Emma curried my coat and Mom brushed my tail.

Thanks to Julie and the forest, we've got a bit of breathing room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy and Emma cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they settled down again, I said, \"Mom, there's a centaur colt in the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a colt?\" Andy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a boy horse,\" I explained. \"He's a colt, and I'm a filly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sat down. \"I guess I'd better look up horse reproduction, so I can give you <i>that</i> talk. Tell me all about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I did, from my attempted jumping routine to my efforts to coax him back out of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was finished, Mom said, \"So, you're smitten with this colt, I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't forbid you from seeing him again, but I ask you to take things slowly with him. You're not even old enough to be shod, let alone have a serious relationship. The last thing I want is for you to be stuck with a foal at your age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a foal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a baby horse,\" Mom and I said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Mom, I said, \"I understand, and I agree that I'm not old enough yet to be getting serious. But, if I can, I'd like to see him again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, there's nothing I can do to stop you. So, yes, you may see him again, if he wants to be seen.

I did not know there were others like me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor did I...\" Smiling slightly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoan slowly came closer and I was able to see that he had longish red hair and green eyes with a very muscular build.

He held up a necklace of a centaur like mine only it was facing the opposite direction. \"I was a normal teen girl before I was changed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I was a teenage boy before all of this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see we all have a lot to talk about.\" Kindly, mom said. \"We'll all have dinner in the barn together.\" She turned to Emma and Andy. \"Can you two be dears and set up the folding table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma and Andy raced each other towards the barn while mom escorted us not too far behind...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, the next day, I turned into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you know about... us?\" I asked, indicating my ears and barrel to show what I meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm healthy.

Once I became a centaur, Mom called in the local vet, who told us about an old woman who knew about the necklace. Long story short, I had helped to protect the forest, so I was chosen to safeguard it full time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why I've been drawn to the forest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. It's a special place. It's a shelter for the animals that humans think they've hunted to extinction. We sustain the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we supposed to sustain an entire forest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our manure is a terrific fertilizer, as Mom can attest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true,\" Mom said. \"Even my brown thumb can't kill a plant nourished by your output.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After dinner,\" I said, \"I'll take you into the forest, let you see it for yourself.\"</span></div></div>",

I had no idea what she had in mind but I would get to the bottem of it somehow. Along the way though, things got a little more interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want this?\" asked Emma, offering the bracelet to me. I was confused as to why she would offer me such a tinket to me. I really wasn't the accesory type of person. However, there seemed to be something that drew me torwards the bracelet, almost like gravity pulling me to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" I told her. I was trying to distance myself from whatever that bracelet was using on me. However, Emma didn't really like the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh kind on, please?\" she pleaded with me. I sighed as there would be no getting out of this for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I'll take it\" I said to her, giving up in the process. Emma smiled and helped me put on the bracelet. It was positioned so that the fanged portions were on the top of my hand. However, right when it was fastened on, I almost felt as if the fangs drew right down into my skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" I grunted in slight pain. It was almost like the thing was a mouth and it wouldn't let up on me. Suddenly, the pain stopped and I was able to look down at it. There seemed to be some slight redness where the bracelet was. I pretty much figured that I wasn't imagining it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong brother?\" asked Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing\" I responded. I didn't need her to know about what I was thinking about. Anyway, we proceeded to Emma's room where she showed me a view from her window. There was a statue of a cat there. Whoever had this house before us apparently believed in cats as come sort of guardians, kind of like the egyptians to an extent. I found it pretty wierd. However, we also had a centaur statue as we believed it brought good luck considering we owned a horse ranch some ways from here. Guess, we're just as weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found that bracelet near that statue. I've always liked that statue though. You think it really protects us?\" she asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe it does\" was the best I could come up with as I subtlely scratched my chest. <i>'What is wrong with me?'</i> I thought to myself.</span></div></div>",

And what's up with my body? I had so many questions but no answers at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully, things will become clear soon\" I told myself. I had no idea about how right I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found my way into the kitchen where my little brother Andy was. He was happily eating his usual cereal. I decided to pour a meal of my own as well. So, I found the cereal I liked and got a glass of milk as usual. Funny thing though, I seemed to have more interest in the milk than the cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to the table and started eating. However, like I just mentioned, I gulped down the milk like it was nothing, surprising Andy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow brother, I didn't know you could drink that fast!\" said the amused little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" I asked. Maybe I just didn't notice something but it seemed to taste better now than usual. So wierd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're almost like Kate\" said Andy. Kate was a girl that was about a year or 2 younger than me. We lived in the same neighborhood so it wasn't hard to meet. Honestly, I've always felt odd about Kate. She often at times acted wacko. She seems to have a liking for birds and fish. A HUGE liking I should say. She also seemed to like milk too. Don't get me wrong, she was a sweet girl; makes everyone feel good around her and loves to help out. However, I couldn't help but think that she was hiding something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way brother, I think you should be leaving soon\" said Andy. He was right. It was about time for me to walk to the bus stop and meet everyone. Once I was done with breakfast, I quickly got my shoes on and got my backpack. However, it seemed to be heavier this time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is up with that?\" I asked myself as I looked into my backpack. It was just as full as normal and I usually had no problems. I was pretty good about working out so this was odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I gotta get some air\" I told myself, just plain fustrated with the current events. However, I had other things to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what is up with...my stomach?\" I asked myself as I nearly buckled over. The discomfort had come back with a vengance and it was almost like it was spreading towards every point in my body. It was almost like what I felt with my waist: like my body was contracting and trying to compress everything into a small space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the discomfort subsided a bit although it was still somewhat present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with my life?\" I asked myseld as I decided to keep walking to the bus stop, unaware that my clothing was a little bigger now. </span></div></div>",

A soft but high pitched, 'Neyow!' escaped my lips. A few of the guys and girls at the bus stop turned to me concerned, to which I muttered, \"Stomach ache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friends who were there shook their heads, concerned, then turned back to their conversation as they knew i did not like talking about my problems. However, Kate walked up to me with a heavier look of worry. \"You don't look so good, James.\" she said. \"A stomach ache wouldn't make you look <i>that</i> pale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Kate, she was about three inches shorter than me with doll like features, shoulder length night black hair and curious green eyes. Kate always wore dark colors with her school uniform but she had the brightest personality, I could not imagine her having any enemies. \"I'll be alright.\" I assured her. \"I was raised to be tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also stubborn.\" replied Kate with a giggle. \"I'd go home and get into bed, if I were you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Samantha Wild, my classmate in homeroom turned to me and gasped. \"James, you're as pale as a ghost!\" she said, almost horrified. \"Why are you even outside!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother classmate, Todd Karl, turned my way and shook his head. \"Man, you look like hell!\" he said. \"Get your ass home and call your doctor or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, James.\" said Kate, tears forming. \"Go home and rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a bit confused by everyone's sudden shift in concern but I was not in the mood to fight for my right to go to school, as I did feel weak. \"Fine.\" I said, sounding disappointed.  \"I'll go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good call, man.\" said Todd. \"Get well soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to call your doctor.\" said Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\" I said, waving bye to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, I slowly walked home, feeling my book bag get steadily heavier. When I finally arrived, I literally dropped by bag by the door and walked into my room before crawling into bed. I was asleep the moment my head hit the pillow. Back at the bus stop, Todd and Samantha looked about as if they had heard a sudden noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's James?\" asked Todd. \"He's never this late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard he's pretty sick and called off for the day.\" said Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad.\" said Samantha. \"I hope he gets better soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she will.\" said Kate with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She?\" asked Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate giggled. \"Sorry, I meant 'he'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, I woke up to find...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pulling back my hand, I was stunned to find that my fingernails had grown. I had cut them yesterday, but they were now much longer than I normally let them grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat up, still staring at my hands, and got another shock, as a huge mass of strawberry-blond hair fell into view. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly covered my mouth in shock. My voice was much higher, like Emma's or Kate's. What had happened to me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand, I pulled my long hair away from my face, and was rewarded with yet another shock. Something was pressing against the front of my shirt. <i>Two</i> somethings, in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't even bother to speculate, I just pulled my shirt off. Sure enough, I now had breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was just this side of panicking as I removed my pants and underwear beneath the covers. If this was what I thought it was, I didn't want to see it without at least a little preparation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was naked under the sheets, I brought my hand up to my belly and slid it down.

I went over to Emma's room to borrow some things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a while to figure out how to put the bra on. The panties were easier, once I figured out which was the front.

The clothes I picked were a simple pair of Emma's jeans, a blue t-shirt, and a purple sweater on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just freaky\" I said to myself. Honestly, I was surprised that I wasn't freaking out right now. You'd think I would be after suddenly changing genders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, another close look in the mirror made me notice something. My eyes were still blue but something seemed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" I asked myself as I inched closer to the mirror. When I did, I gasped! My eyes were stil blue but the centers were slited like a cats!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?!\" I yelled out, tripping over my own feet and falling to the ground. What was wrong with me? I changed genders suddenly and now my eyes were like those of a cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be...neyow!\" I said and I mmediately covered my mouth.

This greatly scared me as they were looking like they wanted something. Suddenly, the cats starting purring all at once. It was so wierd for them to be synchronized like that. The wierdest thing was was it was actually calming me down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was too late.

It stated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'He who choses to wear this bracelet will become one with the Nekos.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaling, I turned to Katina. \"How will I live a normal life, being a boy, turned girl, let alone a Neko-girl!?\" I asked, panicking. \"My life is ruined... it's over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to sob when Katina placed a light hand onto my shoulder. \"Have you ever seen cat ears or a tail on my sister?\" she asked, sweetly. \"We Nekos have the ability to look perfectly normal with a small amount of magic, which you will learn in time. \"First, however, you must complete your transformation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I felt a sharp pain in my lower back, which caused me to scream. Slowly, painfully, a tail began to form and grow from my tail bone to a length equivalent to a cat my size. I screamed again, seeing my human ears moved upward and slowly took the shape of cat ears near the top of my head. A loud <i>Neyow</i> escaped my lips as I then felt my face shifting, making my nose smaller and my mouth more uniformly shaped to that of a cat. When the changes finally stopped, I found myself gasping from the pain as the cats around me began to purr at once, like before, ebbing it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the pride, Jamie Walker.\" said Katina. \"When you wake up tomorrow, reality will have changed and all will know you as Jamie. Only you, your sister, Emma, and the pride will know the old you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about teaching me that magic to make me look normal?\" I asked, hearing the cats purring again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatina laughed. \"We will teach you as you sleep.\" she replied. \"Rest well, Jamie. We will be in touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I again passed out to awaken...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was coming from my own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat immediately shocked me awake.  For a brief instant I thought that this all was just some elaborate dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sleepy-head!\" you could hear from behind you, looking over you saw Kate in her real form.  She really didn't seem a whole lot different from her human self.  She was perhaps a little more furry in certain spots.  Sure her face was catlike in appearance as she had a little button nose to go with her golden, oblong shaped eyes.  Her ears and tail matched her orange colored hair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And she was naked.  Yeah, that was kind of hard to miss.  Then you looked at yourself only to realize you were naked, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing you immediately flailed your arms in attempt to cover yourself, to little avail.  All Kate could do is laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can relax, Jamie,\" she said.  \"We're Nekos, not Humans.  Moving around like this is actually quite normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is?\" you responded in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she answered.  \"Humans tend to be a little more paranoid about their bodies.  They treat them as if they're harbingers of lust, and cover them to prevent their impulses from taking over.  But what's wrong with appreciating what nature has given you?  It's only bad if you make it bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did kind of made a point, although spending my life living as a human it would be hard to break certain customs and expectations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're the only ones here,\" she added.  \"Trust me, you're safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly I put my arms down.  She just looked at me and smiled.  \"We're going to have to break those human habits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" I asked.  Looking around all I could see is trees and vegetation all around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the Lost Forest,\" she explained.  \"These are the woods outside of town.  Think of it as a sanctuary for us Nekos.  It's been blessed so no humans can enter.  If they try they eventually get lost and wind up where they once began.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds convenient,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is!\" she exclaimed.  \"Here you can be your true self.  It's kinda hard to do so when humans cover the entire earth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it would be,\" I responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't seem real thrilled!\" she said, somewhat pouting in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that,\" I explained.  \"It's just...it's a lot to take in.  It's not every day you turn from a boy to a girl, especially into a girl that isn't even human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just it,\" Kate began, \"only girls can be Nekos.  Keeping your sex wasn't an option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You serious?\" I said, surprised.  \"Then how do you procreate?  How do you keep from going extinct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same way you did,\" she answered.  \"We seek out a few chosen girls and we give them a bracelet.  Those bracelets transform those girls into Nekos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" you said dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't meant for you, Jamie,\" she said.  \"Emma prayed to us, and we gave the bracelet to her.  However it was you who put it on.  To be honest, I've always been curious what would happen if a man did put it on.  Guess I know nyeow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't as if I wanted to become a Neko!\" I assured her.  \"I...I don't know.  I just saw it and something told me to put it on.  Emma persisted and well, here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" she replied.  \"Well, just so you know I'm gonna do my best to help you adapt as best as you can!  Just because you're a female and a Neko doesn't mean you can't have a normal life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I truly live a normal life?\" I asked, not sure I could believe that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" she exclaimed.  \"Don't forget, just a few days ago you didn't even realize I was a Neko at all!  Just like you and everyone else I was once a human too!  I still have parents and a family and everything else, and with a little bit of Katina's magic we can make it so no one even remembers James existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...isn't something I'm entirely looking forward to,\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" she said as she gave me a warm hug, making me feel a little more awkward than before.  \"I wish I could fix that but the bracelet chose you.  It's not something that can be changed.  But trust me, being a girl isn't all that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nuzzled me on my neck and then released me.  For some reason it felt real good being close to her.  She just sets my mind at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" she urged me.  \"We got some training to do!\"</span></div></div>",

At first, I thought that I might have gotten a bad rash from somewhere but it felt the same everywhere my clothing touched my skin. At a loss for an explanation, I grabbed some fresh clothes and hurried into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this driving me crazy!\" I said to myself, turning on the water. \"What happened, I feel as if I fallen onto a nest of fire ants in the middle of the night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water gave little comfort to the burning and itching sensation so I tried some body wash my mom had purchased for sensitive skin and tried that, thinking it might help. Fortunately, it did the trick but I never saw any body wash lather up so much, it was surprising. I used mom's shampoo for my hair as my scalp was itching just as bad. <i>\"Why not?\"</i> I thought,  <i>\"What's the worst that can happen?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I had finished my shower, my own question answered itself. I felt oddly cool and was puzzled to find a fine black powder running down the drain. For a moment, I thought it was that black powder that was making me itch until I noticed why I had felt so strangely cool. My entire body, minus my head, was completely devoid of hair! I touched one leg and found it to feel like silk and cringed slightly. \"That's the last time I use that stuff.\" I whispered. \"On the bright side, I don't itch anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling uneasy about my arms and legs looking like that of a girl, I stepped out of the shower and began to towel dry. It was a new sensation, having silk smooth skin as the towel glided across my body and it unnerved me that I was starting to like it. Upon drying my hair, I noticed that it seemed fuller, thicker and decided to have a quick look at myself in the mirror. That was when I received another surprise, my hair was at least four inches longer than before. I stared at it, my mouth open as I knew hair did not grow that fast. \"It's almost touching my shoulders!\" I said, surprised. \"What kind of crap does mom use on herself!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do I do!?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It made me wonder if anyone would notice what was happening to me. Maybe, to everyone else, I was still normal. However, that sounded like wishfull thinking. Well, there was only one way to find out. Luckily, I was still the same size as normal so I grabbed my usual clothes and put them on. They felt so wierd against the new silky skin I had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, Sandra would be jealous of these\" I said with a small smile. My eyes widened at what I said and I shook my head. What in the world was I thinking? I'm still a guy until further notice, thank you very much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I got my usual clothes on and started walking downstairs. Nothing else felt out of the ordinary as I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every thing seems to be going well so far\" I muttered to myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked down the stairs to where the kitchen and living room were. There, I saw my younger siblings there, eating their usual cereal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning James!\" said Emma, shining her bright smile at me. I allowed myself to smile a bit as well. Maybe no one else notices these changes. However, my hopes were soon dashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow James, how did your hair grow so fast?\" asked Emma. Andy was so indulged in his meal to notice at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know, guess it just happened\" was the answer I came up with. Emma was only 7 after all. I'm sure she would accept such an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, where's Mom? I asked them. \"She already left for work\" replied Emma. This worked out well for me. Now, at least for the time being, I wouldn't have to explain anything to Mom or Dad. Hopefully, I could come up with a good explanation by then. Actually, maybe I'll just get a haircut after school. It's not that far away afterall.</span></div></div>",

I'll just get a haircut and make sure I don't use those products again. I didn't know it then, but boy was I wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, while my siblings eat away at their breakfast, I decided to head into the family room to watch a little TV. I had some time before I had to get on the school bus so it was ok. School started at 8:00 and I needed to be at the bus stop at 7:30. It was currently 7:15.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with that in mind, I grabbed the remote and layed down on the couch. I turned the TV on and started channel surfing. I didn't really stayed on one channel a whole lot, unless there was a sports game on or something. Well, there wasn't so I just looked through the channels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boring\" I muttered to myself as I channel surfed. As I did though, it was like a slow aching sensation, starting from my chest, started spreading throughout my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrg, what the heck?\" I asked myself, trying to not alert my brother and sister in the kitchen. I started clutching over, as it felt like my insides were being rearranged, as strange as that sounds. It was like my body was trying to shrink, and become more compact into a smaller size. I was about average size of a guy my age but this was rediculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geh, p-please stop\" I groaned to myself, hoping for this nightmare to be over. I was using one of my hands to hold myself up on the ground while using another to hold my stomach. I was looking at my hand and, if I didn't know better, it looked like it was slightly shrinking to a more petite size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, almost as quickly as it came, the pain disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew\" I said as I plopped on to the ground. I had no clue as to what just happened to me. I shook off the thought of my hand shrinking and got back up. However, it seemed as if the clothes I was wearing were a bit looser than they were before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the--What's going on?\" I asked myself. This was getting wierder by the minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, Emma came into the room. She was holding in her hands a.....</span></div></div>",

I'm actually a great guy, once you get to know me. I'm a twelve year old boy, almost thirteen, with brown hair and green eyes. I like to think of myself as the athletic type, though I come from a long line of scientific types. To the point, this whole mess started on my twelfth birthday when I woke up to a weird rash on my arm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Saturday and I had just pulled myself out of bed, feeling as if I had been hand washed, wringed out like a towel, and hug up to dry. In laments terms, I was soaked in sweat and every muscle hurt. \"Man, I feel like crap!\" I muttered to myself. \"I wonder what I did to feel this bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned on the shower water, adjusting the temperature, then began to disrobe. Only, to my surprise, I found that I had to almost literally peal off the boxers and T-shirt I had worn to bed but it was not because of the sweat, they were somehow now too small for me. Waking up feeling as bad as I did was strange enough but this was just weird. \"I hard of clothes shrinking due to being washed but due to heavy sweating?\" I asked, confused. \"What a freaky morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I had pealed all of my clothes off, having to rip them all to do so, I gazed in the mirror to find that my green eyes seemed to be deeper in color but that was not what freaked me out. I checked myself for any signs of illness, thinking I had caught a virus or something and discovered a sick colored green rash on my upper arm. It didn't itch or burn but I deduced that it was the rash that was causing my strange condition and I pondered over what to do...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I lived alone with mom in our house near the beach in the outskirts of Miami and dad had moved out as soon as the divorce hit. I stayed with mom and I took care of her. I guess mom caught dad fooling around with some lady at the office and she immediately got a lawyer and it was over and out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom would sit on the phone every Sunday afternoon and call her own mother. Grandma was really sweet and nice to me, and she would watch over me when we would come and visit. But that wouldn\u2019t happen so often since grandma lived in Cleveland, Ohio and grandpa had moved to Brazil for some mysterious reason. According to mom, grandpa moved away to do some strange research and he died in Brazil. She never told me why and the subject never gets brought up, so I never asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I started getting this weird rash on my upper arm! My arm started turning this odd, lime green color. While I was in the shower, I put some soap over it and I used a rag and a sponge to rub it off, but nothing helped! The rash remained, and it almost seemed like my skin had just changed color! Not only that, but the rash appeared to cover more of my arm as time went by! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly got out of the shower and dried off. While I toweled myself, I also noticed something else. As I turned towards the mirror, I realized that I didn\u2019t seem so scrawny anymore. It was as if I had gained some muscle. But, I hadn\u2019t lifted any weights or anything, so I just shrugged it off and put on a t-shirt and some shorts. Again, my clothes fit me a little more tightly, but I decided I could live with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom worked as a bookkeeper at a car dealership, so I always loved to stop by the place after school or on weekends or whenever I was bored, so I could hang out with the guys in the service garage. I could look at the cars and carry boxes and lift tires and so on.  Usually, I would go to the recreation center, which was located at a public park down the street from my house and my school, where I would play tennis or soccer after school is over. I would meet with my friends Jason and Kyle there, who I loved to hang out with. We were all geeks, but we loved to kick a ball around or to hit a ball on the tennis court, just for fun or just to kill time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI figured I would approach mom with my rash, and see what she\u2019d say. My only chores in the house are doing the dishes, water her plants, turn on the sprinklers, and do my homework. Today just happened to be Saturday, so I was really wondering what mom would say about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wasn\u2019t buying the whole poison ivy explanation at all, but I figured I\u2019d better just accept the answer for now. It was better than the alternative, which meant a visit to the doctor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s have breakfast. I need to be at the dealership in an hour!\u201d mom said as she turned around and walking into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI certainly didn\u2019t want to cause mom to be late!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I\u2019m so lucky. Not only do I live close to the beach, but I live walking distance to my school. Not only that, but my school is located right down the street from a large public park where we have a dozen tennis courts, basketball courts, baseball and soccer fields, and a large indoor gym with weight room! And it\u2019s all free and open to the public! What more could you want as a teen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Saturday in Miami, Florida! The weather was nice, it was hot and humid outside, and there was no reason for me to stay home. Mom had made eggs and bagels to eat, and I had enjoyed my usual cup of tea as I had my usual breakfast with mom. I can only have breakfast with her on weekends since I\u2019m always out the door early on weekdays because of school. So, she made me an omelet and I promised her that I would do the dishes while she showered and got dressed. Once she was gone and off to work, I grabbed my tennis bag and I put on my white tennis shoes and I was out the door as well. Lucky for me, it was only fifteen minutes to the clubhouse where the courts were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t see Kyle, but Jason was already there, hitting the ball against the back wall on court number 3. I walked around to the back of the court, where I raised the handle on the fenced door and opened it. As soon as I walked on the court, I closed the door behind me so that none of the balls would roll out of the tennis court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo, Jason!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRex! You\u2019re late, dude! Oh, by the way, Happy Birthday, dude!\u201d Jason said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was tall and skinny and he had a dark brown complexion. His parents were Indian and he had dark brown eyes and black hair. He was several inches taller than me, but he was one of the best tennis players I had ever known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, man\u2026 I wasn\u2019t quite feeling myself this morning\u2026 But I\u2019m here now. So, are you ready?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got on my side of the court and he got on his. I placed three tennis balls in my short pockets and I kept one ball in my hand. Then I dropped the ball and let the ball bounce on the court before me, as I swung my racquet and hit the ball hard enough that it sailed low over the net. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI figured I was hitting the ball the same way I was always hitting it, but for some reason, Jason felt like I was hitting it harder than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! I\u2019m still returning your balls, but you\u2019re keeping me behind the baseline! You\u2019re hitting too hard!\u201d Jason said at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 Sorry man\u2026 I\u2019ll ease up a bit\u2026\u201d I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to slow things down, but I gathered that I got right back to returning my balls even harder again. Finally, he returned a ball that made me run to the opposite end of the court. I ran to get it and I made it, but in the process, I hit the ball high and hard, sending it soaring high above the fence, far behind the point where Jason was standing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan! You just knocked the ball over the fence! Why are you hitting so hard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a break, Rex! You\u2019re killing me on the court, dude!\u201d Jason sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both walked back to the bench, where our bags were, and we too some gulps from our water bottles. Then we just collected our balls from the court, before we walked out and returned to the small snack bar which was located in the main building overseeing all the tennis courts. Once we had arrived, I quickly walked to the men\u2019s room, where I had to relieve myself. As I checked myself out in the mirror, I gasped out loud when I discovered that the green rash had grown!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap!\u201d I said to myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rash had increased from my upper arm past my elbow. Not only had that, but my biceps on both arms become noticeably bigger at the same time. That probably explained why I was hitting the ball with so much force. What was going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was freaking out here. I just got a soda at the snack bar and I said bye to Jason before I quickly hurried back home. I figured the best thing to do now was waiting for mom to get off work, so I could show her my arm. Not only was I turning green, but I was becoming more muscular in the process. What the heck was going on with me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I guess it was the 'nerd' in me that was telling me to do so as I was more the athletic type. \"There has to be a rational explanation to all of this.\" I said to myself, briskly walking down an empty path. \"Maybe its something genetic, mom did say that grandpa was working on something in Brazil, maybe he died of what I'm now getting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought shook me to the core and I quickly pushed it out of my mind. \"come on, Rex!\" I whispered. \"Get a hold of yourself, you're not going to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not today, anyway.\" replied a voice behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there!?\" I demanded, turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I wanted you to know that, I would have shown myself by now.\" replied the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am far from in the mood for games!\" I hissed, slowly becoming annoyed. \"What do you want!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now, nothing.\" replied the voice. \"Just mind that temper of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the voice said nothing else. I looked around for several minutes but found no one. \"That was creepy.\" I said to myself, feeling hot everywhere. \"I better get myself home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started walking down the path at a faster pace, knowing that my house was less than a block away from the edge of the woods, hoping to avoid bumping into who ever it was who spoke to me. As I walked, I could not help feel as if several eyes were watching me from the trees around me. I tried to ignore the nagging feeling but it would not leave me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I got to get home.\"</i> I thought, desperately. <i>\"I have a very bad feeling...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you reached the edge of the woods without incident and made a mad dash along the sidewalk for your front door, not daring to look back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finally inside your house, you ran into the bathroom and disrobed to find that the rash was now on your other arm as well, causing you to shake slightly.

Then, I looked in the mirror and found that my eyes were glowing, almost pulsating with rapid heart beat. To say I was shaken would have been an understatement as i watched my eyes glowing, as if with a life of their own. \"Now I've seen everything.\" I muttered, shaking my head. \"I need to relax before I drive myself crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to make myself laugh, I began to make silly poses in front of the mirror. I flexed my newly enlarged biceps then flexed all of my muscles at once as if i were posing for a he man competition. That proved to be a mistake as, upon doing so, I felt my body heat increase to a nearly intolerable level as my muscles began to swell like a balloon! On top of that, the green rash exploded into growth, covering all of my skin within seconds. I could hear my sneakers moan then pop like a tire hitting a nail on the freeway, I heard the rip of my jeans as they fell to my growing size. In all, before I could react, I no longer saw myself in the mirror but a seven foot tall behemoth! I screamed in terror but the scream that echoed from my throat sounded more like an animalistic roar. The power of it shook the room as the mirror cracked and the bathroom window shattered!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! No!\" I cried, my own voice coming through. \"This is not happening! It's not happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI screamed again, the roar shaking to room again as I ran out of the bathroom. Only, at my new size, I made two semi circular holes in the wall on each side of the door frame, destroying it. \"9-11!\" I yelled in a panic. \"Someone call 9-1-1!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I ran down the hall, I was too panicked to realize that I was knocking all of the pictures off the wall as my form barely fit in space provided. I let out another roar like scream as I destroyed a table with my foot in my hate to reach the stairs. In fact, everything in my path was either knocked down or reduced to splinters, causing me to panic even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No!\" I screamed. \"Got to get help! Got get help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to me, my neighbors on both sides of my house heard my cries for help and the terrifying roar of some animal and both called 9-1-1, fearing for my safety. \"He's being attacked by some large animal, bring someone down here now!\" urged Mrs Samson, who lived to my right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, officer.\" said Mr. Hanks, who lived to my left. \"The boy is being mauled by an animal. Bring some help now unless you want me to unpack my shotgun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside my house, unaware that help was on the way, I ran down the stairs but nearly tripped three times as my foot went through the wood. I screamed the first time, coming out like a roar, and literally destroyed the step by swinging my foot out, sending the splinters through the air like missiles. The front two windows of the house were shattered by the first run of splinters. The other two times, the fragments of wood became embedded in the wall, making me scream/roar again. During this entire time, I was scratching myself everywhere, sending trickles of blood down my body, making it appear as if I had been torn asunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom's going to kill me!\" I cried, distraught. \"She'll kill me, she'll kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy neighbors on both sides heard me and became more fearful as several squad cars, an ambulance, and an animal control vehicle arrived in front of my house. I was too stricken with panic to hear them and grabbed the first phone I could find and accidentally destroyed it by simply picking it up. I screamed/roared again then angrily threw the destroyed phone, smashing what was left of it against the front door. Outside, the police officers winced, fearful for my safety and moved in, expecting to find a bear or a tiger someone had kept as a pet and let loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be on your toes, men!\" said the Sergent in charge. \"We may be walking into a blood bath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that same instant, as I picked up another telephone, I saw the flashing lights of the squad cars and let out a low sigh of relief. \"Help is here.\" I said, with a hiccup type laugh. \"Thank goodness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that feeling of relief, I felt my body dwindling down, my muscles shrinking and, unknown to me, my rash receding back to what it was before my terrifying transformation. Only, the change back left me weak and I slumped to the floor, still holding onto the telephone receiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, I woke up...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I couldn\u2019t believe what I had just heard, as my mouth dropped open in complete disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrandpa would turn green? Just like me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Grandpa was a brilliant scientist, Rex!\u201d mom explained. \u201cYour grandpa, my dad, was known as Dr. Robert Bruce Banner. He was in the middle of researching this machine which emitted these powerful gamma rays. This was powerful radiation, which supposedly could make muscle tissue expand and give a living being superhuman strength. Well, somehow the experiment went wrong and there was a gamma bomb that went off in his lab in Dayton, Ohio. Grandpa didn\u2019t get away in time, and he got exposed to the radiation which altered his body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 What happened to grandpa?\u201d I asked mom. \u201cWhat happened to him after he got exposed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhenever he got angry, this gamma radiation triggered this muscular growth\u2026 grandpa\u2019s skin would turn green and every muscle in his body would swell.

She certainly did everything she could in order to avoid having to explain me getting green skin and hulking out into a green giant with huge muscles! Furthermore, they really didn\u2019t find anything else wrong with me, after they had taken my vital signs in the hospital. My blood pressure was a bit high, and I had not eaten anything, so my mom just took the blame for that and I was released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom quickly drove me home and she made me some chicken and green beans (more green stuff!) in the microwave. We had a quiet supper together, and she repeatedly asked me how I was feeling. I was actually feeling more tired than anything, so I just took a nice cold shower before I went to bed early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Sunday I just packed my backpack for school and I focused on my homework. While I was studying, I noticed that my arm started developing that green rash again! It seemed like something that was recurring; like it would come back on a daily basis. I was almost afraid that I would have this weird growth spurt every day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man\u2026 Here we go again!\u201d I said to myself, as I glanced at the green patch of skin on my lower arm, just between my wrist and my elbow on my right arm. Then, when I looked over, the same thing was happening on my left arm as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly got up and walked to the bathroom so I could examine my reflection in the cracked mirror, which was hanging from the wall. To my great shock, I saw that my eyes were once again glowing a bright, lime green, and my face was slowly turning that same lime green as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming again\u2026 It\u2019s growing\u2026 It\u2019s coming out\u2026 It wants to come out of me\u2026\u201d I whispered to myself as I stood in the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, however, I was determined to remain calm. I wasn\u2019t going to panic. If this green, big, \u2018Hulk\u2019 figure was going to burst out of my skin and take over my body, and then I would let it, without causing a panic! I had made up my mind that I was going to do whatever it takes to control this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! I-I\u2019m here! Now\u2026 Stay calm\u2026 Rex\u2026 Breathe in\u2026 Breathe out! You\u2019re turning green again\u2026 Muscles age growing\u2026 I see it\u2026 I can feel it\u2026 I\u2019m feeling stronger\u2026\u201d I said calmly, as I felt my heartbeat increase slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just raised my right arm without flexing it\u2026 I noticed that my biceps had gotten bigger! I slowly looked down and noticed that my chest started to bulge out as well. Wow, my chest was really getting big! Two big, round balls of muscle were sticking out from my chest. Below that, I saw how I had all these abdominals covering my stomach. My legs were also bigger and wider and my calves looked like they had grown a lot as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 I\u2019m in control\u2026 I\u2019m the boss here\u2026 This is MY body\u2026 Let\u2019s see\u2026 What did I do yesterday? I flexed my arms and my legs and everything else and then everything just got really BIG!\u201d I pondered as I continued to examine myself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe if I just relax, it will go away\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a few deep breaths as I closed my eyes, hoping that I could control this hulk-thing. When I opened my eyes again, I saw that the pupils in my eyes were very, very bright-green! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 Hold on\u2026 Take it easy\u2026 If I become big again\u2026I\u2019m not gonna move\u2026 Stay calm\u2026\u201d I said to myself, as I made my fists and slowly tensed my muscles, one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flexed both of my biceps and my abs and my pectorals and my quads as well as my calves\u2026 Just for a moment\u2026 Like a few seconds\u2026 Then, I opened my eyes and I saw that green rash rapidly spreading all over my body! My face; my ears; my nose; my lips; my arms; my hands; my feet; my legs; my chest\u2026 everywhere! I was completely green! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it happened! For a few seconds, I was overcome by this intense cramp feeling in every muscle in my body! Then everything started to grow very quickly! It happened so fast, that I can barely describe it! My arms grew bigger and longer as my legs become longer and thicker, as they swell with incredible muscle! My quads just explode with layers of muscle as they grow thicker and wider at the same time! My calves become as round as soccer balls, and my biceps inflate until they\u2019re even bigger than bowling balls and they\u2019re just as hard even! My entire body grows bigger and taller, where I quickly stretch from 5 foot 4 inches to about 7 feet in height in just a few seconds! Amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cARRRGHHHH!!!!!\u201d I roar in the bathroom as I hulk outward, sideways, and upward as my body grows in every direction as it turns completely lime-green all over! My face changes too! My jaw becomes more angular and my hair turns shades of green. My head actually becomes squarer as my face stretches upward and sideways a little bit. My ears and nose grow out a bit, like everything just gets bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily I wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt, pants or shoes, because I would have ripped out of them! My feet grew to twice as big, twice as wide and much heavier than before. My toes were big and thick! And green! The same counts for my hands, which become twice as big as before with fingers that are enormous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the growth stopped, leaving me standing there, looking in the mirror at this big, green figure, who is staring back at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa\u2026 I\u2019m big again\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven my voice sounded a bit deeper than before. I speak with a baritone voice, as I flex my arm, revealing an enormous bicep popping up on my arm. The one good thing about this is that I\u2019m feeling strong\u2026 Really freaking, enormously strong\u2026 Strong enough that I can lift a tank!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 It happened\u2026 I changed\u2026 Stay calm\u2026 I\u2019m still here\u2026 I\u2019m still me\u2026\u201d I said to myself, making sure that I was still the one who was moving my arms and legs, even though I looked like this big, ugly, green monster in the mirror. \u201cOkay, I have to change back to normal\u2026 I gotta relax\u2026 Just let go\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just closed my eyes and bowed my head down. Then I let my arms hang by my sides. I cleared my mind of everything as I tried not to think about anything. Then, I felt something that seemed like my body was returning to normal. My body began to shake a little bit, followed by a sweat. My heartbeat began to slow a bit, which was good. I was beginning to relax. Then, I was overcome by a slight, sinking feeling, which felt incredibly relaxing and soothing. It was as if I was shrinking a little bit. And, indeed: When I opened my eyes, I had shrunk back to normal and the green spots on my skin had faded! I was back to normal again! I figured I had found a way to return back to normal after I had grown into that big, tall, green, hulking figure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt happy. This was big. No, it was huge. Because, my big worry now was\u2026 school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would happen to me if this green rash was to show up on my arm and I was at school? Part of me hoped I never had to find out! My next school day was only hours away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd boy, was I right to worry about this. What would happen, if I were to exert myself at school? What if I was to find myself in the situation where I had to flex every muscle in my body, and I was to suddenly hulk out in the middle of class? What would I do? Where would I go? These things started to cross my mind as I woke up the following morning and I started to take my shower and got dressed.  To be honest, I didn\u2019t even want to think about it. I just had my bowl of cereal in the morning and I packed my bag as I walked to school, knowing that everything had changed for me from this moment forward. I would have to be super careful at school, or else I would morph into this big green giant, and I wouldn\u2019t have any clue how to explain this to my classmates let alone the teachers at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had I arrived at the schoolyard or Jonathan, one of the geeky guys from math class, approached me. He always liked to talk to me about math and science, since he had heard stories about my grandpa from my mom, but this guy was a bit too geeky for me and I tried to keep my distance. Somehow, Jonathan always made an effort to look me up, even though I preferred to hang out with Jason and the other jocks who played tennis and soccer at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Rex!\u201d Jonathan said, as he walked next to me. \u201cI was looking for a partner to work with me on the project for the science fair. Would you like to team up with me? I don\u2019t have a partner yet!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm\u2026 I was kinda thinking about teaming up with Jason, so let me think about it, okay?\u201d I replied in a serious tone of voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we got another week or so to pick our partners, so don\u2019t take too long!\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will let you know! But, keep on asking around in case you find someone else, alright?\u201d I said to him. I didn\u2019t want him to get his hopes up that I was going to be his partner so I kept the door open for him to ask other guys too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked through the main doors, Geoff, one of the guys on the basketball team, walked up to Jonathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen here you dimwit! You owe me a Dollar for every Monday that we have class! That is money that ensures that you don\u2019t get beaten up, remember?\u201d the tall boy said to the geek, with an evil grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t being any money today! So, leave me alone!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw what was going on. Since Jonathan was short and very skinny with glasses and thin, blond hair, he was the prime victim of the big guys who were on the basketball team. He was their favorite target! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff then walked up to Jonathan and ripped his backpack out of his hands! Then, he started opening the zippers as he began rummaging through his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you must have some money in here\u2026\u201d the tall basketball player said, as he started pulling things out of the bag and throwing them on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my bag! Give it back!\u201d Jonathan shouted, as he ran up to Geoff. But, since Geoff was so tall, he just raised the bag up higher, far out of the geeky boy\u2019s reach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy bag! Give\u2026 me\u2026 my\u2026 bag!\u201d Jonathan shouted as he started jumping up and down as he desperately tried to reach for his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive him back his bag, you big bully!\u201d I shouted at the big buffoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind your own business, Rex!\u201d Geoff said, as he looked me straight in the eye. \u201cGet lost!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat made me very angry. I set my own bag on the floor as I charged full speed at the big moron, slamming his big body up against the row of lockers! Due to the impact, he dropped the bag and I caught it with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive it back! NOW!\u201d Geoff shouted, as he reached down with his long arms and grabbed hold of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was holding on to the bag on one side as he was holding on from the other side. He began to pull the bag towards him, and I began to pull it towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAARRRRRRRRR!!!!\u201d I groaned as I pulled the bag towards me with every ounce of strength that I got, flexing every muscle in my body.  And, as I looked down, I could see my fingers, my hands, and my arms turning lime green\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral other students were surrounding us as my color started changing rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at Rex! He\u2019s turning GREEN!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck is going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Rex\u2019s muscles are getting bigger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAARRRRRRRRR-RRAAAAAAHHHHHH!!\u201d I let out a mighty roar as I yanked the bag out of Geoff\u2019s hands with incredible strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I dropped the bag on the floor as I realized that I was green. All green! My muscles were big\u2026 Getting bigger\u2026 and growing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026 No-no-no\u2026. NO! ArrrrrRRRRAAARRR!!\u201d I growled as I ran towards the boy\u2019s bathroom while my body was still changing, which was incredibly difficult since every muscle in my body hurt like crazy! I broke out in a sweat and I was feeling incredibly hot as my pectorals ripped out of my t-shirt and my calves burst out of my jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRRIIIPPPPPP!!!! CRAAACKKKKKK!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood motionless in the deserted bathroom as I grew bigger and taller. My skin was completely green, and my feet had burst out of my sneakers and the bottom of my jeans had torn to shreds. I tore the remains of my t-shirt off and turned around, realizing that I had hulked out at school. This was a nightmare! How was I going to get out of here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I heard the bathroom door open. It was Jonathan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRex? Are you in here? Thanks for returning my\u2026 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Jonathan walked past the last stall and saw ME.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHHHAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!! A MONSTER!!! THERE IS A MONSTER IN THE BATHROOM!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! NOOO! Jonathan! It\u2019s me! Rex! Ohhh NOO!!\u201d I tried to say, but he went running out of the bathroom, screaming at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the guys in the hallway didn\u2019t believe him at first, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at Jonathan! What a sissy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is scared of everything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a wimp!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I came out of the bathroom, in plain view of dozens of my classmates. Everyone gasped all at once, and then\u2026. All hell broke loose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYYYEEEEEEEAAKKKKK!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA MONSTER!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019M OUTTA HERE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHE\u2019S GONNA KILL US!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHE\u2019LL EAT US ALIVE!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guys pulled the fire alarm, while made everybody else come out into the hallway and see me and freak out too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYYEAAAAAAAAAKKKK!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad. This was really, really, REALLY bad. I had to get out of here\u2026 NOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around and ran towards the first emergency exit and I slammed against the huge steel doors until the burst open. Then, using my super-strong legs, I ran towards the fence and I leaped over the six-foot barrier until I landed all the way on the other side of the road. I then vaulted onto the rooftop of a warehouse until I raced to the park and got out of sight. From there, I leaped over thirty feet into the air, landing straight into our front yard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed the handle of our front door and broke it, opening the door and slamming it behind me, practically smashing the door frame. As I turned around, I saw mom, looking at me with a surprised expression on her face. The TV in the living room was on, and she was watching a special report on the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRex? How was your morning? Let me guess\u2026 Are you responsible for this?\u201d mom said, as she pointed to the TV set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I sat down on the couch as I stared at the TV screen. I noticed that once I had allowed my body to relax completely, my muscles began to dwindle back to normal and my green skin color faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at the news broadcast showing my school! The lady, who was the announcer, was standing in front of the entrance to my school!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Superintendent of the Miami-Dade School District had just arrived at Hialeah Middle School in Northern Miami today to take control of a serious situation after a large man with green skin was last seen entering the school grounds. The security guards are placed on high alert today and all the teachers have placed the entire school on a complete lockdown since a strange muscular man, of about seven feet in height, wearing only torn jeans, was spotted in the boy\u2019s bathroom. Nobody had seen the man walking in the building and the security guards have no idea how the man, who was reported having green skin, entered the building. It was also not clear how the man was able to scale the six-foot-tall fence, since there are no traces of the man having cut through the fence anywhere. The man appeared in the boy\u2019s bathroom shortly after a scuffle had broken out between three students near the row of lockers, and the large, muscular man had just appeared out of nowhere! All the students have left the building by now after the man was spotted in the bathroom. Five police cars have arrived on the scene, and the Superintendent had decided to cancel all classes for the rest of the day. We will keep you posted as soon as more information becomes available!\u201d the announcer spoke on the news broadcast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI broke down in tears as mom sat down next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I d-didn\u2019t do it on purpose, m-m-mom! I swear! They were picking on Jonathan and I tried to\u2026 I tried to help him out\u2026 Geoff had taken his bag and\u2026 I tried to get it back\u2026\u201d I sobbed. \u201cI hulked out in the process of trying to get the bag back and now THIS happens!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Rex\u2026 You\u2019ll have to learn to live with this thing\u2026\u201d mom said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I? I\u2019m a big, green monster!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom just stared at me with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrandpa would have been so proud of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Maybe\u2026 If grandpa were around\u2026 we could help each other out\u2026\u201d I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrandpa is out there\u2026 Somewhere in the mountains of Brazil\u2026 I wish he could see you right now\u2026 See what you\u2019re like when you\u2019re big and green\u2026 Just like him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at mom. Somehow, my sadness turned to joy. Someday, I would take that trip to Brazil and find grandpa and show him what I\u2019m like. Maybe next summer. For now, I had to learn how to master the green monster thing and figure out how to survive the school year living with the possibility that I could become a green muscle giant again if I didn\u2019t learn how to control this thing very soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I became more shaken as i found a number of police officers and government type men in suits, questioning everyone. As I was about to head to my homeroom, a familiar voice reached my ears, causing a chill to run down my spine. \"I <i>told</i> you to watch that temper of yours, kid.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spun around to find a man in his early thirties with brown hair and brown eyes, wearing a black business suit. \"Who are you and what do you want from me?\" I quietly demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go home, Rex.\" said the man, ignoring my questions. \"Learn to control your power and emotions, I'll call you when you can return to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is ridiculous!\" I said, annoyed. \"I'm going to class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go home, you were lucky no one saw you change the last time but luck runs out eventually.\" said the man, more coldly. \"I'm trying to save you from the nightmare your grandfather went through.\" he paused. \"If you don't know what I'm talking about, ask your grandmother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the man casually walked away, down the hall as your gym coach, Mr. Watson came up to you. \"Rex, what are you doing here?\" he asked, surprised. \"We were told you were injured by that monster that was in here yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... err.... was the first to see him in the bathroom.\" I said. \"It turned to face me and accidentally caught me in the chest, knocking the wind out of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatson winced. \"Well, stay home for a few days and rest up.\" he said. \"I'll have someone bring your homework to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, we walked away, leaving me with no choice but to return home...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I figured these muscles were still a part of me, so I just had to learn to control this thing on my own. I had to figure this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked to the bathroom and closed the door behind me so I could examine my reflection in the mirror. I removed my shorts and my t-shirt, leaving me standing there wearing just my underwear. Then, I just concentrated on becoming big again, by flexing every muscle in my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on\u2026 I know you\u2019re there! Come on!\u201d I grunted as I flexed and concentrated even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after a minute or so, I saw my skin change color as the green hue returned. That was always the first sign that I was turning into that hulking figure again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed, I was able to stop flexing and let nature take its course. Once I turned green, there was no stopping it. My muscles just inflated on their own and grew bigger and bigger, tensing up automatically. I\u2019ll be honest here, it felt great! It was an amazing feeling, just to feel every muscle in my body swell to insane proportions! My calves bulged to the size of melons while my quads grew bigger and wider at the same time, adding layer upon layer of bulging, green muscle to my legs. My biceps exploded like crazy, blowing up like never before, until they were round as cantaloupes and covered with thick veins. My pectorals shot out and forward from my chest, making my upper body bigger and wider at the same time. Gosh, every time I Hulked out, it seemed to get easier! This was almost getting too easy! On the other hand, I was amazed that it took me so little effort just to get the process started, which turned me into a Hulk-boy. I sported an awesome set of abs below my pecs and my arms were incredibly thick. I was now every bodybuilder\u2019s dream! The only thing\u2026 I was lime green and I had green hair and I had bright, green eyes! I had grown almost a foot taller and my hands, my feet, my fingers, my toes, and just about everything else about me had gotten twice as big as before! I was way over 6 feet tall\u2026 Make that almost 7 feet tall, and I was bursting with muscle and I was completely lime green, from head to toe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 Okay\u2026 Calm down, Rex\u2026\u201d I panted in my deep, baritone voice\u2026 I couldn\u2019t believe how I sounded now. It even sounded kinda sexy. I was so huge. I hate to admit it, but I was actually started to like this \u201cHulking Out\u201d. Yes, I had become a big, green monster. But, MAN, I was STRONG! I had muscles everywhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so HUGE, I almost couldn\u2019t fit in my bathroom! My shoulders were super wide and my torso was enormous! My arms were super-thick and they were covered with muscle all over! My hands were enormous, they were like shovels! Not to mention my gigantic feet and my titanic calves which were bigger than basketballs. I was the most muscular dude ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 Now\u2026 I need to become normal again\u2026\u201d I said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a deep breath and I closed my eyes. I told myself to relax. Relax. I let my enormous arms just hand off the side of my hulking body. Gosh, it almost seemed impossible to relax with all this muscle. But, I had to learn this. I had to CONTROL this\u2026 BEAST that was ME. I was in control! I didn\u2019t want this Hulking-thing to control me\u2026 NO! I had to be in control of my muscles and my body. I\u2019m in charge. My muscles don\u2019t control me. I control THEM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I willed them to shrink back and for my skin to fade back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, I felt my muscles dwindle back to normal. I was becoming smaller, or normal again. Within moments, the green color faded away and I had shrunk back. As I opened my eyes, my reflection was the old Rex again. I was covered with sweat, but I was happy. I had mastered the Hulk in me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I was home anyway, I decided to pick up the phone. I called grandma. I tried her again. She was home this time. I got dressed and I hopped on my bike. About twenty minutes later, I was at her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrandma\u2026 I learned something\u2026\u201d I told her, as I sat down on the couch facing her, as she sat in her rocking chair. \u201cI can control it! I can make it grow my muscles, and I can make it shrink back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s very good dear!\u201d she smiled. \u201cTake your time and learn how to use your strength.  Don\u2019t be afraid of it. You\u2019re doing something I wish your grandfather had done\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she mentioned grandpa, so many more questions suddenly entered my mind\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No animals, though, which kind of made me wonder why it was built in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess things started to get weird for me the morning after my first period. I mean, the occasion itself was standard, with Dad congratulating me and Mom giving me The Talk. The next morning, though, was completely different from what I expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started when I woke up. It felt like I'd been wrapped in a straitjacket. I couldn't imagine what had happened. Finally, I took a deep breath, and something ripped. After that, I felt a little better. That's when I examined myself. The thing that was too tight on me was my nightgown. It had fit me fine the night before, but now it looked like it was made for someone smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Mom doing something outside my room. We preferred to do things ourselves, even though we could afford servants. \"Mom,\" I called, \"can you take a look at this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Mom to knock on my door. \"Did you say something, Nancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" I replied. \"Hang on.\" I crossed the room and opened the door, and this is where I got another shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was 5'7\".

It seemed like nothing could keep them apart. Then came the event that changed everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed out by Three Mile Point. \"As I heard it, Mom and Dad were having a picnic out there, when it happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A meteorite. It crashed close by, and sent a fragment into my mother. The doctor patched her up, and said he wanted her to come in, if anything happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't take long. You see, Nancy, she started growing. A few inches at a time, at first. Once she got big enough, the growth started coming in feet. She didn't stop growing until she was 50 feet tall. Then came the big shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What big shock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was pregnant. At first, she worried that the baby would be as big as she was. When that turned out not to be the case, she was positively terrified, worried that she couldn't bond with her child, or that she might accidentally crush it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was born to her in due time. I've been told that my birth was quite memorable for the doctor, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" I asked, \"what happened to Grandma Nancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"She commited suicide, not long after I was born. She went out one night and pulled apart a transformer. We never knew exactly why. To make it all worse, some movie studio made a film out of it, changing everything but the names. Dad tried to sue, but the pinheaded judge figured that the different details made it a completely different story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mom, I'm so sorry.\" I hugged her. Pretty easy, considering we were the same size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething occurred to me, and I pulled away. \"Wait a minute.

He was the oldest teacher in school, only a few months away from retirement. \"You know about this?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I do.\" Smiling, Mr Moore said. \"Your grandmother was quite the celebrity here in town though she feared for everyone's safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Moore sighed. \"You need to understand that the world your grandmother lived in was completely different to today.\" Softly, he explained. \"When word spread of her giantess status, a lot of power hungry people, including some from the government wanted to take advantage of her.\" He sadly shook his head. \"With nowhere to hide, she decided to take her own life rather than put the community she loved at risk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one helped her...\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We tried to help her.\" Sadly, Mr Moore said. \"Only how do you give a depressed fifty foot woman a hug and tell her everything is going to be alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"That doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a different world today.\" Smiling, Mr Moore said. \"We still have inequality, hatred, and discrimination only less people are willing to tolerate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made me smile. \"Thank you, Mr Moore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to hurry on to my first class only a sudden pain in my body caused me to yelp and buckle over. Instantly after, I grew right in front of the students and teachers. As I slowly stood up, I found that I now towered over everyone. Mr Moore took out his cellphone and asked to stand straight and still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You- You want to take my picture?\" Blushing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a measure app which will allow me to measure your height.\" Calmly, Mr. Moore replied. \"Let us see how much you grew this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood as still as I could as Mr. Moore pointed his cellphone at my feet then moved it up to my head. \"Impressive...\" Smiling, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How tall am I now?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven foot.\" Smiling, Mr. Moore said. \"You are growing just as your grandmother did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the bell rang and I hurried to my first class...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The uniform that had fit me just days ago now looked like something from the children's department in my hands. With nothing else to do for it, I went to Coach Simmons's office and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door quickly. \"Yes, what can I do... for... you... ?\" she asked, as she got her first good look at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held up my old uniform. \"I have a small problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that. Well, I may have a small problem of my own: I don't know if we have anything your size.\" She went back into her office, and returned with some sweats. \"The absolute largest things I have. If these don't fit, you'll have to sit out P.E.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went back into the locker room and put them on. They rode higher on my forearms and shins than I was used to, but they were better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor P.E., Coach had us play basketball. My teammates looked me up and down, then said, \"You're the guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn many ways, it was the ideal position for me. I didn't have to handle the ball, I just had to prevent opposing players from getting a clear shot at our basket. Nothing's easier for someone who stands taller than the rest of the class can jump.</span></div></div>",

I must have passed out for a moment because the next thing I knew, I was surrounded by my classmates, a teacher, the nurse and the bus driver. \"You gave us all a bit of a scare, young lady.\" Gently, Mr. Moore said. \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I guess... a little dizzy.\" Sitting up, I replied. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You grew three feet.\" Wincing, the nurse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" I looked down and gulped. Sure enough, I was now close to ten feet tall, too tall for the bus. I began to tear up and cry. \"How am I going to get home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was where your grandmother stopped growing for a while but I do not know if it will be the same for you.\" Serious, Mr. Moore said. \"Don't fret...

All of my classmates were staring too to which the giant woman merely smiled and gave a kind wave with her fingers. \"Don't worry, after ten years, I'm used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Isa Colossus.\" Kindly, the giant replied. \"Mr. Moore was also my teacher only at an online class. I lived on the other side of the country.\" She smiled. \"I just recently confessed to Mr. Moore that I was a giantess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are here to help me...\" Hopeful, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsa nodded. \"I come from a long line of giants.\" Smiling, she said. She sighed. \"If my family had known about your grandmother, we would have helped her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point is, Isa is here to help you through these difficult times.\" Calmly, Mr Moore said. \"She has also brought a number of legal papers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Legal papers?\" Confused, I asked. \"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To keep the wolves at bay.\" Serious, Isa replied. \"There are people who would profit greatly off of a giantess, you need to be prepared before they take notice of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"I appreciate but I'm curious... how did you get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsa giggled then pointed to a semi truck. \"Come take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe helped me to my feet and led me to the truck with everyone following. The truck looked normal until Isa opened a large door in the trailer. Inside was a huge seat with pedals, steering wheel, a gear shift  and a digital screen. \"This allows me to travel without anyone batting an eye.\" Grinning, she said. She laughed. \"You should have seen the look on the guy's face who tried to 'brake check' me on the freeway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get a ride?\" Hopeful, one of the students asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other students voiced their hopes of getting a ride only Isa shook her head. \"Sorry, but I can't do that.\" To everyone's disappointment, she said. \"Not without parental written approval, anyway.\" She turned to me. \"I'll take you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I jumped into pass anger seat behind Isa in the trailer, I said, \"You know they are going to ask their parents for permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsa nodded. \"I know.

My Harry made it for me. He wanted it to be a reminder to me that the same meteorite that had changed my body so much could also bring beauty.

Instead, let my words be a warning to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy Archer, the 50 Foot Woman</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Joyce finished reading, I screamed in agony. I had felt this before, so I had an idea of what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, I grew again, reducing my dress to a pile of linen rags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I stood up again, I saw that I was now 15 feet tall.</span></div></div>",

The worse news is, it's done the same thing to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear. Did you at least get the package I sent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not. Is it supposed to be a surprise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I had hoped it would help you. It's a special ointment my grandmother created. Rub it all over your body after you shower, and it'll take away the growing pains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like I could have used it today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hopefully, it will help you for the rest of your growth spurts. I really want to help you, Nancy. You remind me of me when I was growing. Like you, I was scared, thinking I was the only one in the world this had ever happened to. You aren't alone, Nancy. You are part of a community, and we all help each other, just like I know that you'll help the next giant you meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I intend to, Summer. In the meantime, I'm in need of a bigger shower, and I've got a meteorite fragment that needs to be disposed of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call on some of my relatives to help you out. I'd do it myself, but I've got my babies to think of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, Summer. You'll do what you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I hung up, Mom came to the barn. \"Sorry to bother you when you're dealing with this, but a huge box just came for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the ointment.

Fortunately, it was a Saturday so I had no school to worry about so I decided to make myself an early breakfast. \"I'll have to call Summer later on and ask if this is a giant thing.\" Yawning, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started a large pot of coffee and began cooking a full box of pancakes before throwing in a big pot of oatmeal. I still could not believe I had such a huge appetite but then again, I was still growing. I had just brought my breakfast to the table when I heard the barn door creak then creak again. Someone was trying to sneak inside. At first, I thought it was some random burglar and decided to give him or her a surprise. I waited in the shadows near the door and waited. Only the surprise was mine when I spotted a nine foot boy slowly enter and look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are more giants than me...?\" Tearfully, he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes there are.\" Startling him, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy jumped and tried to run out only he tripped over his own shoes and ended up falling completely inside my apartment. He was rather cute with his fair brown hair and blue eyes... his blush made him even cuter. \"I- I'm sorry to trespass.\"  Stammering, he said. \"I- I was just- just looking for a place to sleep for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI unsuccessfully hid a bemused grin. \"You could have knocked.\" I offered the boy my hand. \"I couldn't sleep so I made some breakfast... are you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy blushed even more before shyly smiling. \"I am a little hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled. \"Then let's have a little chat over some breakfast.\" Helping him up, I said. \"My name is Nancy Duquesne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'm Skylar Flynn.\" Shyly, the boy replied. \"I sort of ran away... afraid I was going to hurt someone being so big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought the same when I first started growing.\" Honestly, I said. \"My grandmother was Nancy Archer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Nancy Archer, the fifty foot woman?\" Surprised, Skylar asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"She too thought she was alone and committed suicide.\" Sadly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came from a desert town north of here.\" Changing the subject, Skylar said. \"It only has a population of around a hundred so everyone knows everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And trouble can brew quickly for those who fall out of the norm.\" Sighing, I said. \"Well, you need not worry, you are not alone. There is a whole community of giants out there and they look out for each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar blushed again, trying to hid it with his cup of coffee. \"I had always hoped there were more giants out there, I just did not expect to meet one as beautiful as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was my turn to blush. \"You- you're just saying that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean it.\" blushing as well, Skylar said. \"You are beautiful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to shabby yourself, Skylar...\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Behind them was a large group of people cheering and crying out kind words for Skylar. Some were carrying signs that read <i>'We love you Skylar'</i> and <i>'Please come home'</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like your whole town came to show their support.\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar was smiling, tears of joy streaming down his face. \"They all came here just for me... what...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all small towns fall apart in a crisis like horror movie makers like to depict.\" Smiling, mom said. \"Many band together and become stronger for the experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA petite woman and a tall man came running from the crowd and embraced Skylar as best the could with him returning their embrace, crying. \"Mr. and Mrs. Flynn, I presume.\" smiling, I said. \"I am Nancy Duquesne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple looked up at me in surprise then embraced me and mom. \"I am Gwen and this is my husband, Archer.\" Introducing themselves, Gwen said. \"Thank you so much for looking after our little boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We knew you were looking for love, son.\" Lightly teasing, Archer said. \"But you could have left a note...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar and I both blushed at that just before he grew three feet before our eyes, reaching twelve feet in height.

Not that I'm complaining, mind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we ate, Archer asked about us. Apparently, he was named for someone on my maternal grandfather's side of the family, so he wanted to hear stories from Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe asked about me, too. \"Why'd you bring extra clothes along, Nancy? Your mom didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom isn't a growing girl, Mr. Flynn. I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still? How, uh, how big do you think you'll get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifty feet, like my grandma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were telling me about it when you all came for me\" Skylar said. \"Hollywood made a hatchet job of a movie about her grandmother, but she's been protected from anything like that happening again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Mrs. Flynn,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you direct me to the not so little girl's room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, dear. I think we can help you. Right this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ascertaining what I needed to do, she invited me to let nature take its course in the pasture. As I did so, I got another growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my,\" she said. \"How is it that you aren't in nearly as much pain as Skylar goes through?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The secret is a special ointment, Mrs. Flynn. Mom gave Skylar the recipe. Just rub it on after a shower, and you won't feel a thing. Could you please get my change of clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll say this for Mr. Flynn: If he was surprised to see that his 20-foot-tall dinner guest had become 25 feet tall, he hid it well.</span></div></div>",

I blushed seeing him then giggled with him soon following. It was then obvious to everyone we had feelings for each other.

When this had all started, I thought I was alone in the world much like my grandmother was. Only now, I not only found an entire community of giants but a sweet boy as well who I very much think I'm falling for. \"I've got to call Summer!\" Giggling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could be asleep at this hour.\" Smiling, mom warned. \"You might want to wait until morning before you call her.\" She smiled. \"I talked to Skylar's parents, we will all be taking a weekend vacation to California to meet the other giants. Mrs Colossus has already made arrangements with a modified air hangar she was planning to use as a summer home we can all use during our stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis news made me even more excited but I reluctantly agreed to wait until morning before calling Summer. I knelled down so mom could kiss me on the forehead then waved as she went back to the house. Upon closing the door to my barn apartment, I ran for the phone. I was just too excited to wait. <i>\"It's not like a promised to wait.\"</i> I dialed her number and waited anxiously. She answered on the third ring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Summer Roberts speaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't wake you, did I?\" Softly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.\" Calmly, Summer replied. \"I just got back from a college football game. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... met someone.\" Softly, I said. I could not help giggle in excitement. \"I think he might be the one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...?\" Summer asked. I could almost see her grinning. \"Who is this young suitor, and how did you get to know him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Skylar Flynn, from a desert town a few miles away.\" Joyously, I replied. \"He had run away from home, fearing he would hurt someone, being nine feet tall, and stumbled upon my barn apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sneaked in?\" Surprise in her voice, summer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did, but I was already awake... something was telling me I would have to be for some reason.\" Calmly, I said. After a pause, I asked, \"Is there some sixth sense among giants along those lines?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I heard the phone ring, something was telling me it was important.\" Honestly, Summer said. \"So perhaps, yes, we do... But, please tell me... what is this Skylar like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he's wonderful...\" Dreamily, I said. \"It turns out his entire town was worried about him, and, when they learned where he was, the whole town came to convince him to come back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds wonderful.\" Kindly, summer said. \"What does he look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has fair brown hair and blue eyes.\" Sighing, I said. \"He's really cute when he blushes...\" I smiled, remembering our first encounter. \"When his dad teased him about looking for giant love, he grew three feet on the spot.\" I could not help giggle. \"Your grandmother's ointment is becoming famous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer laughed. \"What does your mother think of all this?\" Bemused, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wants me to wait before dating him.\" With a huff, I replied. I imitated mom's voice, \"You have plenty of time to get to know him before going out on a date, you're only fourteen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sounds like my mother.\" Giggling, Summer said. \"Will we be meeting him soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom and I are coming out to California as part of our winter vacation.\" Now excited, I said. \"You visited us, so it's only right we do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where will you be staying?\" Curious, Summer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Colossus has already made arrangements for us to stay at a converted air hangar she was planning to use as a winter home.\" Happily, I said. \"We will be arriving early next weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look forward to it.\" Smiling, Summer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of talk, we ended the call and I fell back into my bed, giggling like a little girl...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My trousers too had changed. I decided if I was turning into a girl, I may as well get it over with. I took off my shirt and pulled at my skin. It came off to reveal a body with no breasts.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Economic Crisis hit Japan a year ago.  It's like a tsunami, merciless and all, washing away everything in sight.  My family's currently clinging on to a flimsy lamppost, hoping that we'll survive it.  Mom, as a priestess, has been praying loads to Inari.  But he doesn't seem to be helping much.  Maybe he's on a holiday or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least we're alive for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the summer holidays.  And with Dad working himself dizzy, and Mom praying all day and night long, I'm pretty much rather lonely.  So during most of my free time, I pace about in the Shikotsu Toya National Park.  It's very nearby - at the south west parts of Sapporo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI call up my friend, Aran-Chan, and he agrees to go along this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baking sucks.  I've baked maybe a hundred pieces..?\" Aran tells me wearily.  \"So I'm taking a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, we set off towards the Forested Mountains of the National park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't stay long,\" Aran sighs.  \"Got to get back to help my Dad out with the Bakery.  Times are... hard you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and agree.  \"Same here.  Mom wants me to help clean out the shrine before dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that doesn't stop us from hiking further.  The nature's beautiful.  But too bad hardly anyone comes here during these dark times.  The newspapers even reported on poaches snooping in here and poaching wild animals.  It's illegal.  But they must be <i>desperate</i>.  <i>Everyone</i> is desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex!\" Aran yells in delight. \"Hey! Hey! Look that way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do as he says, and true enough, a fox stands by trees, looking frigid and majestic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe its <i>Inari</i>!\" exclaims Aran.  \"Maybe he has come to purge the shortage of food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Inari</i>?\" I frown.  \"I think its just a fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though to agree, the fox paws the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Aran isn't taking any chances.  He bows down at once... to the fox.  I try to suppress a laughter, but it bursts out anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it is Inari,\" Aran scowls at me.  \"You're so dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI share a look with the fox, and to my surprise, the fox seems to be talking.  Maybe its me being delusional again, but I swear!  Its talking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is that humani doing?</i> The fox laughs outrightly.  <i>Bowing to me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jump out of my skin upon hearing that.  \"Err.. Mr Fox...- you're....  Ah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, I'm surprised you can hear me speak</i>, The fox frowns.  <i>But you're unusual, and so is your friend.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unusual?\" I ask the fox out loud.  \"What do you mean, Mr-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex?\" Aran stands to his feet, looking at me as though I've just flown to outer space and back.  \"You're talking to.. a fox?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were bowing to one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAran grins.  \"I'm sorry if I'm interrupting you two,\" he says sarcastically.  \"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the comfort of the trees, the fox chortles once more before padding off, whistling a foxy song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't believe what I've just seen.  But it must be a mistake! A fox?  Did I just have a conversation with a fox?  I rub my eyes, and when I'm done, the fox is no longer there.  Well, I'm definitely delusional!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAran and I walk some more distance, chatting on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A poacher broke in here yesterday,\" Aran informs me.  \"Those idiots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrug.  I pity the animals, but it ain't the poacher's fault either.  \"They must really need the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" He argues stubbornly.  \"It's a National Park!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI agree him, and speak of the devil, gun shots echo in the distance.  Aran and I look to each other, eyes as wide as tennis balls, before we sprint off in the direction of the gun shots.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head suddenly starts throbbing madly. My vision begins to blur.  I see Aran yelling worriedly in my direction and running epically at me in slow motion.  It is amusing.  But my mouth isn't mine to move anymore.  Then my vision turns black, and the world seems to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I gain consciousness, I find myself running at the speed of lightning.  Just running, running and running.  I wonder why.  I try to twist my head back to see the threat, but I an invisible force forces it back front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stop it</i>! a familiar voice echoes.  <i>Stop controlling my head!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What?</i> I ask back in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What're you doing in my... head?</i> The voice demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>WHAT?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're the boy I met earlier</i>, the voice says.  <i>The one I talked to.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm in shock.  I look down at my 'feet' to find paws in place.  Furry orange fur in place of skin.  And I'm running- not on twos, but on fours.  It occurs to me there and then, that I'm somehow, a fox!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, you're not a fox!</i>  the voice says irritably.  <i>You're inside me! Somehow...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm inside a.. fox?-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBullets appear above my/the foxes head and I realise some is shooting us.  I try to turn my head behind to look, but again, the fox refuses to allow me to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A POACHER IS AFTER ME- I MEAN US!</i> it yells urgently.  <b>Don't look back!  Run!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA poacher...  Oh no, what have I gotten myself into?  I'm in a fox's body or head, and a poacher is after us?</span></div></div>",

To the tunes of a bygone era slowly dance timid couples, with only one or two off on their own. The singles among them sit on washed-up planks and frolic about the beach. It's a beautiful night. But up on the cliffs overlooking the bay sits the very bored and very lonely lady, Faustina Dusan. She's tired of these constant beach parties and wonders if there's anything beyond them. A longing for something, <i>someone</i> interesting to come along drove to her to this lookout point to seek him out. She'd just about given up the search when that someone other found her up top. Clad in red from head to toe, and uncharacteristically clean for someone coming off the beach. Tina eyed him with complete interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do, Miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tipped his hat to her. She took in the sight of his face for that flicker of a second before he donned it again. Young, handsome, just what she'd been picturing up here all alone. So when he offered his hand to her, she grasped it eagerly. The soft strains of the melody down below soared up to the cliff heights and carried them into a dance. With grace he waltzed her to the very edge of the rocks and back again. In his arms she floated about as if she were a breeze. The whole experience was so surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, the dance ended, as did their brief acquaintance, or so it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be off, for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will I ever see you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how will I--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as quickly as he came, he disappeared. Faustina sat back on her rocky perch and mooned over the mysterious stranger who'd swept her off her feet. Who could he be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool rolled around again with no sign of the young man. Tina sighed as she sauntered out of class. To think, in a town as small as this one, a man like that could go missing. No one else that night even registered seeing her suitor. It was bizarre and a tad unsettling. Tina tried to put it out of her mind as she opened her locker to switch out her books. Just as she went to shut it, her hand brushed across another. She spun around to see that very same gentleman who hadn't left her mind! Despite the absence of the hat, she could still tell just by his impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you we'd meet again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're a student here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the prying eyes of the entire student body on her, Tina stood paralyzed. The lad shut her locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should go somewhere else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe motions to the front doors. Tina takes up his arm and follows him out. Whispers trail her as she goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know just the place where we can talk...\"</span></div></div>",

One day won't hurt anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina  then hopped in his car, ready to go just about anywhere. She had no clue where he'd take her, but at this point, it didn't matter. Getting to know anything more about him would be a dream. They veered off into the distance. He sped through the town and careened through the suburbs. All at once they were back on the outskirts of town, rounding the beach curve. Sure enough, they passed right by the cliffs of their first encounter. As Tina looked to her right, she spied a palatial mansion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has that always been there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my father had it built before we moved. He's a man of exceeding discretion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina ogled every inch of the manor as they pulled up.

How did you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you use it? I find it a lovely name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina swooned a bit. Wylie grinned and casually opened the door for her. She stepped in as calmly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exterior couldn't compare to the grandeur of the interior: tall paintings, gold fixtures, plush furnishings, and more candles than Tina had ever seen in her life. She reached out to touch a particularly brilliant bauble, before Wylie's hand caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though the house itself is relatively new, the decor is not. I'd prefer if you didn't touch it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina laughed it off and continued on her tour with Wylie. He paraded her up the marble staircase, pointing out the beauties of his family heirlooms and the treasures his father had amassed over the years. Tina gaped in wide-eyed wonder at all the things she'd only dreamed about or seen in movies. Wouldn't it be a dream to live in a place like this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped before a set of doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The main halls are nothing compared to our laboratories, however.

Tina slid past with Wylie behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab shone in the overhead lamplight with stainless sheen. Impeccably organized tools and trinkets lined the walls, ranging from the mundane objects that could be found in any garage to bizarre contraptions unknown to most anyone. Despite the calming and clinical atmosphere of the space, Tina found herself increasingly unnerved by the space. She couldn't put her finger on it, but something felt wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my own private lab. It's just perfect for conducting experiments, wouldn't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always had a penchant for discovery. I'm always testing what happens when I apply this to that and so on. So naturally, I turned to the sciences as a means to satisfy my curiosity for the unknown. My father raised me this way; after all, he was just the same. In my early teens, we used to travel the country and perform experiments, with some notable successes. And back on the island, we used to work together. But now, he's mostly shut himself in his study. I rarely ever see him anymore. It's left me incredibly lonely, Faustina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, you're the first person I've spoken with in this town. It's so nice to meet someone like you, after moving from place to place for so many years of my life. Other times, I'd met a few 'subjects', but none so special as you've turned out to be. I've got a little something to ask you, if you'll have a seat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't ignore the suggestion. As she moved into place, Wylie whispered a phrase she couldn't make out in her ear. Just then, she fainted into his arms. Her breathing slowed along with her heart rate, and she could only feel a terrible chill running up and down her back. She drifted in and out of consciousness. Wylie continued to speak as she faded, muttering in that indecipherable language of his. The words rung out like a command. She felt the chill turn into burning heat, then she couldn't feel a thing and blacked out entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBright lights woke Tina. She jumped up from one of the lab tables that she'd earlier taken a seat upon. It seemed she was still in Wylie's house. Wylie, of course, sat across from her and had her hand in his. Some sort of watch or bracelet was on her wrist that she didn't remember wearing before, but she assumed she must have forgotten putting it on this morning. As her vision cleared up, the bracelet disappeared, so it must have been a mirage. She tried to get up, but Wylie stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. The temperature of the lab sometimes affects people who aren't used to it. You should be fine now. Just rest for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I just felt the need to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped herself before finishing the sentence. Why would she want to run away from her most hospitable host?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just rest. Now, as I was starting to say before-- Faustina, how would you like to become my new lab assistant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lab assistant? What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though I adore the sciences dreadfully, the truth is I can no longer work alone. The nature of my-- <i>projects</i> -- deem that impossible. So, in the evenings, you might visit me here and help with my work. I'll reward you with anything your heart desires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Anything?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mused on the subject ever so briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His arms brushed up and down her back, stopping at the shoulder blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear it. Let me take you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe helped Tina to her feet and ushered her out the main lab door. For a moment, she thought she spied the bracelet again as he caught her arm coming into the main hall. But, a quick brush up against his side proved that the object wasn't there. Tina assumed it was the aftereffects of her brisk chill from before. As they passed out of the front door, Tina gasped at the hazy darkness over the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nighttime already? I didn't think we were in there so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, time flies when you're having fun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what will my mother think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\"YOU TRAITOR---!!!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice rang out from the top of the mansion. Tina gazed up to see a flickering light in the tiny window up there. She wanted to stare, but Wylie turned her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only my father, he's having one of his spells...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swept her into the vehicle and drove off within seconds. Though she didn't mind the haste, Tina couldn't help but pick out the shouts over the roar of the wind in her ears. She could barely make out the voice, or was it voices?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><b>\"You told me you'd changed! You dirty liar!</b></font><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">How dare you do this to--!!!</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Wylie cranked up the radio on the car and the pounding drums drowned out the rest of the sound all the way back. Only after they reached the cliff did he return to a normal volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say? I like a good song now and again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina looked at him incredulously, but then he slipped his arm around her. She couldn't help but smile as he swerved his way back into town. She didn't know how to describe it; she was just <i>drawn</i> to him. Before she knew it, they'd reached her doorstep. Instead of wondering how he knew where she lived, however, she desperately avoided getting out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I want to go in. My mother, you don't know her, but she's scary when she gets mad. She's a real monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hush, the only monsters in the world are the ones we make ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little joke me and my father share. Don't think anything of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up the path without further delay. Wylie spun her around and peered deep into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine. Your mother won't even notice you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, she won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll come find me tomorrow after school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he left her at the door. Tina slowly made her way inside, and sure enough, her mother didn't spot her sneaking back into her room. Tina took a huge sigh of relief and slid onto her bed. Her thoughts still stuck on Wylie, she couldn't wait to get through school tomorrow...</span></div></div>",

No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't get him out of her mind. And neither could the rest of the students, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you heard about that new guy that moved to town? He started school here just yesterday! Weird, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say!

Both fixated on hearing her side of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gee, I don't know, girls. I only met him the other day, and he seems so nice--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? Did he take you somewhere nice? <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i>Did he try anything funny?</i></font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it, Elaine. All you ever think about is funny business. Obviously Tina wouldn't let a guy take advantage of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina reddened in the face, unable to truly describe what happened yesterday. Had he done anything strange to her? An inkling of suspicion crept over her mind, but it quickly faded away. She tried to focus on other things, but by the time she did, others were talking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"I heard he's moved seven times in the past three years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know he used to live on his own private island?

She wanted to spend the evening in the company of her friends. But as she turned to Gretchen to reply, Wylie Methodios caught her eye again. He beckoned her forth with a wag of his finger, and she sashayed towards him entranced. She had no idea what was happening around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"School's out for the day. How about we head up to the lab? You do remember our agreement, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clung to his arm and stepped right out of the school, even leaving behind her back.

It couldn't hurt, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took her arm in a much different manner this time, slowly slipping the needle into it. She hadn't expected that, but no resistance built up to it. Instead, Tina almost smiled at the chance to be Wylie's prized subject. As he injected the strange red chemical, she fluttered a bit. Her arm twinged a bit, and Tina watched as a flicker of scarlet swirled around her wrists. It couldn't be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, you're just imagining things. Everything will be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina snapped back as if nothing had happened. She felt invigorated, but couldn't quite place the source of her mood. Along with the burst of energy came a peculiar sensation. She felt... different. It probably was nothing. She was just imagining it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling? Warm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, yes, which is funny. I thought it was cold in this room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only yesterday. The experiment called for it, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The experiment? I thought we started today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWylie patted her on the back, and his hand rested there for an odd amount of time. But this time, it slid down her back to curl around her waist. Never before had a boy held her like that. Tina didn't know how to feel about it. They turned to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel we're making real progress, Tina. I can't wait to see what the future brings, can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina nodded, ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll let me know what happens, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina gave acknowledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And one last thing, you won't tell anyone about this, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl. Now, about the rest of the evening...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How about dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina agreed, as a muffled growl erupted from her stomach. She hadn't figured she'd be so hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father takes his meals up in the tower, so I'm afraid it'll only be the two of us this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina was too distracted by her sudden hunger to take note of what Wylie said. Ever the gentleman, he set forth promptly. Wylie snapped his fingers and pushed against one of the stainless steel walls of the laboratory. It parted to reveal a hallway lined with more doors. As the two of them made their way through this labyrinthine passage, Tina started to feel woozy. Wylie corralled her with one arm and escorted her into the dining hall. Though several massive tables lined the walls, an intimate setting for two sat center stage. Two meals hid beneath silvery metal tins. She could smell them from here, and she started to drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She almost flew to the table in the pursuit of food. He moved close behind, and withdrew the domed prison that held captive the meal. To Tina's surprise was a banquet fit for a king. And most of it (at least on her end) was red meat! Along with the typical steak, there was pork, lamb, and a few other foods Tina couldn't identify. Though it was a bigger buffet than she'd ever had, she scarfed it all down. Bones and all. Wylie merely grinned as he sipped at his drink and picked apart some other creature on his plate at a relaxed pace. As Tina nearly licked her plate clean, she finally caught sight of herself and sheepishly pushed herself away from it. Her face burned a bright red as she coolly sipped down water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I guess I was hungrier than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no trouble. Good to see you have an appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look he gave her after that comment embarrassed Tina further. She had no idea what had come over her. Her attention moved to anything but his gaze. She looked at her hand. At least her nails looked like a girl's should, if they weren't a little too sharp. She'd try and file them down when she got home. Tina mindlessly tried to pick some gunk out of her teeth, only to scratch her tongue! Discreetly, she tried to feel the tip of her teeth, and noticed an unnatural point to them. Wylie's eyes caught her again, and she coyly tried to laugh it off. He smirked along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you need a moment, the washrooms are behind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, no, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Wylie finished his dinner, he brought out a bottle of what resembled red wine from nowhere. He poured Tina a glass, but she was apprehensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shouldn't be drinking, we're underage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to fear, Faustina. This is no alcohol. Go ahead, try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she honestly wanted to reject the offer, the drink was brought to her lips before she could protest. It smelled wonderful, so unlike everything she'd ever tried. She allowed herself a sip, then a gulp, then the whole thing. After that, she swore off the stuff, until he poured her another glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'll have it every night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't stifle a smile at this point. It wasn't just good stuff, it was great. The food was excellent, too. What luck to find someone with such refined taste! She could get used to this. Tina craved more than just the banquet, however. She couldn't place her finger on the other need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer a short walk around the grounds after dinner. If you'd care to join me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't even a question about it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an expansive lot, that was for sure. Tina glanced over the vast blooming fields without a care. Satiated from her hunger, now she struggled with a yearning for something else... Something she couldn't quite figure out and something that inflamed as Wylie stepped closer to her. He trotted her about the gardens without much purpose, or so it seemed. For every so often, he'd pick a lovely little flower and adorn her with it. Tina enjoyed the aroma; it invigorated her. But still, that desire for something or other pervaded her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Tina wore a crown of flowers. Wylie, impressed with his work, finally stopped at a nice stone bench. Tina took a seat right next to him. Her heart thumped with anxiety. Wylie continued his examination of Tina silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he undid her tidy ponytail, letting her hair spill out over her shoulders. He ran his fingers through her hair, each time a little longer in duration. Then, his focus drifted to her hands, which he nonchalantly viewed while holding them. His hands slipped from hers and disappeared for a moment, after which she found them wrapped around her waist. They drifted up her back again and gently brushed up against her shoulder blades. The spot tingled under stimulation. Wylie began to pull her closer, his eyes focused directly on her face now. She tried to look away to avoid embarrassment, but it was for naught. Tina opened her mouth to speak, which only drew him nearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wylie, I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i>\"Have I told you how wonderful you are to me, Faustina?\"</i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina blushed like a rose at his soft-spoken statement. She didn't know what to expect from Wylie. Tina had never known many guys, and never romantically. Was that what she wanted? A small voice chimed away in the back of her head, begging her to continue. Tina made her own move closer to him. But Wylie's face dropped the passion from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a fragile bloom, I'd hate to push too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe withdrew a bit, triggering Tina to whip her arms around him, too. Wylie snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did promise me anything my heart desires...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemptation crept into Tina's mind, which put a name to the feeling she'd been victim to ever since the first night on the cliffs. She was tempted by what Wylie had to offer her, and she longed for more than just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no turning back, Faustina. If we do this, I'll make you mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe teased her, and she played along. Tina's arms coiled around Wylie's neck, and the moment awaited. At long last, he indulged her the first kiss she so desired. Their lips pressed together, their arms impossibly locked around each other, their embrace sealing the passion of the night in one fell swoop. Wylie wanted to pull away first, but Tina wouldn't let him. She forged on, until at long last he had to push her away. The awkward pause that ensued after that terminated the mood of the evening. Wylie looked positively drained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive home drifted by without much incident. Wylie didn't speak at all until they reached her doorstep. Tina reached out for him, hoping to score her second kiss, but he was cold to her. She straightened herself up and didn't react to it. If he didn't want to kiss her again, then she wouldn't disobey him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Faustina, we'll continue our work tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A glistening morning sunrise. Scintillating beams showered Tina's humble bedroom with bright light. Tina awoke reluctantly, so used to the darkness in Wylie's abode. She sluggishly crept out of the covers, wiped her eyes, then meandered towards the bathroom to wash her face. Like every day, she stepped onto her little footstool to reach the sink; she'd always been rather short. As she did so, she couldn't help but notice a strange draft in the room. Had she left a window open last night? Tina turned over her shoulder to check; no sign of tampering at her window frame. Her eyes drifted back towards the bathroom mirror, and only then did she realize how different her perspective was today. Whereas normally her head just barely entered the bottom edge when she stepped up, today she was barely in it from the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina backed down quickly to get a better look at herself. Her reflection was now centered in the glass, so she'd grown at least a foot overnight! This unsettling discovery led to another, as Tina lowered her hands from the sink to her sides. Her arms brushed across the hem of her skirt! Sure enough, her pretty little nightgown barely resembled a camisole at its current length. Tina coyly tried to pull it down, only meeting great resistance. As she furiously tugged at her tiny gown, she accidentally turned it into a blouse. Then came revelation number three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina gingerly wrapped up the torn portion of her nightgown and slipped back into her bedroom. After locking every conceivable entrance, she slid out of her pajamas and set about getting dressed for the school day. Obviously, there were a couple of problems to tackle first. And going sixteen years without puberty, Tina was clearly unprepared. She hoped that her mother might have something for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Mom?! Come quick! I need help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tina's mother didn't respond. Tina nervously paced around the room, then made a run for it. She bolted through her mother's bedroom, praying she wasn't in there. Tina snuck into her mother's closet discreetly, and desperately searched for what she needed. At long last, she located a decent sized brasserie and struggled to put it on before her mother saw her. It didn't fit in the slightest, but it would work for now. Tina nonchalantly exited the room just as her mother entered, and she wondered why her mother looked so dazed. It's as if she'd walked right through Tina without a second thought. A quick check of the clock reminded Tina to hurry up, and she threw herself into the search for fitting clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of her old blouses were done for, and the biggest sweaters she had were stretched paper-thin across her frame. She practically emptied her wardrobe before she settled on a thick black button-up which held tight despite the strain. Skirts proved just as problematic as none of them wanted to cover her new frame. She eventually settled for a red pencil skirt, though it kept crawling up her legs. She fought to pull her hair up again, as it seemed to trail down her shoulders no matter what. Her temporary solution tucked it all behind a headband. Tina stood dumbfounded at the complete change in her appearance from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould anyone recognize her? She looked vastly different from before. What had even brought this about? Was it a growth spurt, or was it---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud chimes erupted from her alarm clock, reminding her of the burden of school. She threw together her belongings and hoped for the best. Tina would be out of luck if things fell apart. She scurried out the door without a thought to her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, Mom, I'm off to school. Sorry about borrowing your, well--- goodbye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she began the long and difficult walk to the high school, pondering on whether or not her attire would hold up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I am The Hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy real name? Unimportant. You'll just forget it anyways. But if you must call me something, call me Reiter. It means Raptor in English. It's what my 'friends' in the orphanage called me in which I was raised. It was the children's way of degrading me. To make me seem by name less than human. Less than what they were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNames stick. You never lose them. People would always called me 'Reiter' from then on. It was an evil thing to call a young child. But I suppose, people being as petty as they are, will always feel themselves empowered, if they denounce others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge? I sincerely do not know. Precisely how old I am is a mystery to myself. My parents had abandoned me in a gutter. I have no birth certificate to show you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy any sane standard, I've had a cruel and abusive childhood. By law, it was the orphanage's duty to take me in from the starvation of the streets. But the kids there and the Matron would do anything in their power to make my live a misery in order to kick me out. But I was stubborn. I stayed despite the bullying. Despite the beatings of the Matron. The rest of that backwash, piece of #### rathole town in which I lived wasn't any better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe community had no reservations when it came to make example of me. I survived being stoned no less than 3 times over the period of a decade. In all three times, they had stopped only when they thought I had been dead, because I had been buried so deep beneath rocks and pebbles that I was completely submerged in earth. 3 times the Constable, the only soul to have pity on me, and then only because it was his duty to uphold the law, unearthed me and nursed me back into a semblance of living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see: I am an albino. Something considered akin to an abomination. A freak, a monster. Oh was very human back then. I...WAS very human back then...<br>\r\nBut of course being human still didn't prevent the hatred against someone like me. I was certainly NOT a sight for sore eyes. My hair was the colour of ashes and my sickly pale translucent skin that of virgin-snow. My lips were purple from malnutrition and my nails fell out. My skin was wrapped tightly against my skeleton, like ducktape applied too firmly on a present, as a result of starvation and hunger. My bony jaws, shoulders and ribs shone from beneath the tatters which I called my clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most intimidating of all: my eyes. They were pink-red. Something quite natural for albino's; merely something to do with a lack of pigmentation I would later learn. But I was a foolish child. I believed it when people started whispering that they were the eyes of a demon...<br>\r\nThey shone like paraffin lamps out of a cabin against my fair pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day my tormentors, 3 large bullies, succeeded in cornering me. They had beaten me to a bloody pulp for 10 minutes, and I still hadn't so much as lifted a finger to save myself. I wouldn't have minded if they had killed me then and there. I didn't have much aspirations to live for, other than the next stolen loath of bread...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then came a little girl; she couldn't have been more than 8 years of age. Her name was Marta...I think(names are meaningless to me). A fellow orphan. <br>\r\nShe rushed and stood in from of me, shielding me from my tormentors with her body. It was rather pathetic.<br>\r\n\"Stop hurting Reiter!\"<br>\r\nThe lead bully made his greatest mistake when he swung the led pipe in his hand against her petite face, sending her sprawling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason that, THAT, sent me over the edge. One could mutilate and torture me for as much as one likes, but for some reason seeing someone else, seeing that little girl abused as I had been, filled me with molten anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt rejuvenated. Filled with energy. Or maybe it was just adrenaline. I changed. Transformed. Before my own shocked eyes and their own. My nails grew. Out of my fingers and into razor claws. My toes grew into talons, gleaming silver. Out of my back 2 rods shot from the shoulder-blades. These rods lengthened and slendered. They turned into massive batlike wings. Wings which I flapped wildly and amateurishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sight reddened as if someone had held a crimson tinted vizor in front of my face. With the reddening hazy vision it felt as if someone had packed ice all around my skin; goosebumps covered my entire exterior.<br>\r\nI could see myself clearly in the frames of some broken windows in a shop next to me. It was an intimidating sight. The original me was still there. Somewhat. But I had claws sprouting from my hands, talons from my feet, and wings that fluttered from the torn clothing of my back. Other than that, all was the same as before. I stared agape at myself as you could expect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I didn't expect, was the bullies's next words: \"Where'd he go?!\" asked the lead shakily.<br>\r\nWhat did he mean? I was standing right before the idiot. But they all stared through me, past me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I don't like this! That demon-freak looked like he was melting the one moment and the next he just disappeared!\"<br>\r\n\"I say we get out of here! I can't see Reiter anymore.\"<br>\r\n\"Forget it!\" said the lead arrogantly. \"I'm not leaving till that freak is scrap beneath my boots! Come out little Reiter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I understood. I was invisible. I waved to attract their attention, but they remained oblivious to me. I was invisible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't come out where we can see you, Reiter, I'm going to start beating this brat!\" said the lead and held up Marta by her pigtails. She wailed, begging me to save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't keep her waiting for long. The first bully was sent hurling across the plaza to smash like a ragdoll through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy- Where'd that come from?!\" I answered him by holding him by the front of his collar into the air; there she swung, drunkenly kicking for air. I was surprisingly strong for my small form.<br>\r\n\"Help! Help! A ghost!\" he shouted feebly in a shrill voice.<br>\r\n\"No! Just Reiter!\" I answered with venom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened to saucers and his pupils shrunk to pips. I sent him following the same fate as bully #1. <br>\r\nI turned to the lead. He had a knife out and held it against Marta's neck. How quiant.<br>\r\n\"I'm warning you demon-freak! Just come closer; I dare you to see what happens! I knew! I knew you were a monster!\" he called out uncertainly to the empty plaza, clearly not knowing where I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dared not speak to reveal my presence, my only hope to resolve this for Marta's safety.<br>\r\nI snuck up on the lead from behind, him still cat-calling to me and gripped the knife's edge with my bare hand. It cost me a hole through the palm, but it ensured Marta's safety. I wrenched his hand backwards and pulled Marta from his reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redness faded from my eyes and I felt as if being remolded like candle wax again, the ice-cold sensation left my skin. I saw my claws retract and my wings regress back into me. The lead bully's scowl unmistakably indicated that he saw me now. I wasn't invisible any longer.<br>\r\nHe charged at me, but I just broke his nose as easily as one would push in the lid of a paper coffee-cup. He sank to his knees and I kicked him into the dreamworld...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny Marta screamed at me. Sighing, I let her down.<br>\r\n\"You...you really are a monster!\" she said pointing at me fearfully. I didn't answer; just stood rock stiff. So she ran and I never saw her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI inspected myself. All traces of the shocking transformation was gone. I was the normal unhandsome me. Was it something I could control? I didn't waste time figuring it out here, for I was in great danger as it was.<br>\r\nI stole the clothes from the 3 incapacitated bullies; for I would need them in the cold of winter. I could no longer stay here. I was done with this rotten place and its inhabitants; they would only come to stone me the moment they had found out about what I had done. I neither knew nor cared where I was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I walked. Never looking back on the orphanage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was going to find out how to replicate that transformation. How do I become invisible again? Could those wings really fly? I would find out somehow. The invisibility intrigued me most. It was a good thing not to be seen, and I would never make myself seen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a new name for myself: the Hidden.</span></div></div>",

I know some nice asylums near here...\" said the barman disbelievingly, serving a new glass to Flint.<br>\r\n\"Ha! You're SUCH a comedian. Have your laugh; you're not the first idiot to doubt me.

It was illegal to remove anything from a town-hall notice-board, but Flint never did give a rat's behind for the law.<br>\r\n\"I mean COME ON! He's only an albino!

There is only so many ways one can afford to pay that kind of money in these parts. Opium or gun-running.\" said Flint callously, taking in the interior of the dark, shadowy musky bar.<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah...but you didn't hear it from me!\" the barman said hurriedly and scurried away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint bended his neck to the side to snap the vertebra back into place and turned in his stool to survey the bar inside more closely this time. Also, embarrassingly, to have something to lean his back against before he fell over from his drunken fervour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar was filled with the scrap of society. Bandits, thieves, lowlifes and each and every form of undesirables. All were armed, scarred and in a mean looking mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint tsked. This was exactly why he despised Bounty-Hunts. It attracted the worst of the lowest.<br>\r\nFlint preferred contracts. Hitman jobs and assassinations. In the underground world, reliability and trustworthiness was a highly regarded trait for hired guns. If you had the integrity to carry out a contract without cheating, you would never find yourself short of work. For kingpins and billionaires would rather hire men at a greater cost and know they would kill the objective or die trying.<br>\r\nThere was a very unique and professional code of conduct and etiquette when it came to a \"Killing-contract\". Both the employer and employee knew they would get their end of the bargain, because they knew that word of the other's cheating would spread though the underground and they would never be able to engage in a contract again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while 'Contracts' were clean, Bounty-Hunts were...messy. Not to mention bloody and violent. This violence rarely come from the hunt itself, but from your competition!<br>\r\nYou see the rules were simple: the man/woman who brings the 'target' or proof of the death of the target (usually in the gruesomely ironic form the target's decapitated head for a literal 'head-hunt') to the benefactor, was the one to be paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot, I repeat NOT, the individual who actually did all the work and killed the target! In a 'contract' you are the sole huntsman, but in a bounty-hunt you have to worry about the dangers of competitors who would likely kill you without thought or reason, just to eliminate the competition/opposition. A bounty-hunt is therefore a grueling rat-race; a very deadly one.<br>\r\nThe underground had a term \"parasites\". It referred to bounty-hunter gangs who tailed a professional tracker and waited till he got the job done, then pounched on him and stole his prize right under his nose. Sometimes they even killed the tracker as well for the sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd since a Bounty-hunt is open for all, it attracts every rat from sewers of the crime-world looking to make a quick buck. Some really disgusting people. Flint really, REALLY, despise Bounty-hunts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the one reason why Flint had made an exception for this Bounty-hunt was that he had heard through word of mouth that this kid, this albino kid had gone invisible. Interesting. Maybe this backwash town wasn't filled with such retarded superstitious folk after all. This 'Reiter' as they called him would make an excellent ....\"retrieval\". Flint was NOT joining in on this hunt for the money, only the privilege to hunt, to track another true monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first things first. Time to deal with the immediate trouble. 3 jackasses were making a bee-line for him, walking with the intent of obvious malice. They were dressed poorly; hoods covered their faces; they all wore brown leather breeches and woolen cloaks draped across their shoulders; they carried their arms resting on their hips, hands resting on large partially sheeved bayonet knives; it was as if they were trying to shout to the world that they were thieves! The bar silenced and the murmurings quieted down. All could see murder was soon to be. This was gonna be fun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood in a semi-circle around Flint. The leader arrogantly holding his head high and looked Flint up and down as if sumarising whether a school boy was properly dressed for the day. Flint's head swayed slightly to the sides and back, the clear result of intoxication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we have here?\" smirked the thief.<br>\r\n\"I think its an amateur!\" said a second.<br>\r\n\"Drinking on the first night! You should know better before entering a job!\" said the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Job? I don knoaw wha ya meaan.\" slurred Flint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there's no need to hide it, my good friend! We know you're a bounty-hunter. It's written all over your face!\"<br>\r\n\"Ma face?\" said Flint holding his cheek as if to feel something there that he had not noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. And we thought, why don't we get to KNOW each other a little better. Seeing as we'll all be such good comrades very soon!\"<br>\r\n\"So why not buy us a drink, buddy?\" asked the second thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a hike, sunshine!\" replied Flint, unfearingly.<br>\r\n\"Don't you think its unwise to upset your new friends?\" queried the 3rd thief with malevolence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take one step forward...and I'll kill you with my cup.\" said Flint evenly, toasting them with the tin-cup he in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvents came and went in a blur. Flint's apparent inebriation disappeared completely. The 1st thief ripped out his bayonet with a flash and struck at Flint's belly. Flint stopped the thrust with the tin-cup; the bayonet embedded into the bottom. Wrenching the tin-cup sideways, ripped the knife out of the thief's hands and breaking several fingers in the force, making him yelp in pain. But Flint wasn't done yet: he scraped the top rim of the tin-cup against the cement of the table underside in one quick motion, which sharpened the edges drastically, and shoved the cup top-first into the throat of the thief to pierce his esophagus. The thief clutched feebly at his destroyed throat in which the make-shift sharpened cup lay embedded and collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 remaining thieves retaliated and was wasted in quick order. The 2nd, learning from the 1st thief's mistake, struck sideways, while the 3rd thief struck on the opposite side. Flint, thinking on his feet, grabbed the 2nd thief by the knife-armed wrist and manhandled him as a shield in front of his comrade. The 3rd thief couldn't stop his jab in time, and impaled his friend through the heart. Throwing the 2nd thief aside as if discarding an empty bottle, Flint strode up to the final vagabond, which pulled out a pistol. But he never got to use it as Flint grasped him by the throat and smashed him neck-first into the ground. The sickening bone-crunching snap of his spine could be heard resounding throughout the awestruck silence of the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint spat on the dead thieves and strode out of the shadows of the bar. None dared stand in his way or look him in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped on his snow sledge-bike and burned the throttle. After he was certain the engine was heated sufficiently in this frozen cold he hit the afterburner and was off, mowing through the thick snow.<br>\r\nFlint always was in a good mood when he cleaned up the garbage of the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe studied the map of his GPS and Pathfinder. His bet: the Reiter would hike the shortest route to the next village in this godforsaken cold. Flint would intercept him in no time. The only problem was that every other Bounty-Hunter would figure that out pretty soon as well. Those 3 morons he had just wasted had been hired by a quick tip off to slow him down. There wasn't a moment to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint swore that he would get this albino kid first, regardless of whether he was a monster or not. He grinned as the excitement of the Great Hunt pumped through his vanes and the cold wind of the winter blowed over his scarfed face...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"WHAT THE F###?!\" I had raged at the desolate wastes of the steppes when I had seem myself the first time after a complete transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until that point I had only been able to grow the wings and retract the claws and talons from my hands and feet.<br>\r\nI had felt my face go green in sickly disgust at my reflection in the mirror-like frozen pond. I wasn't revolted at myself because I looked ugly or hideous. In fact...sort of, I had appeared the opposite. But...this just disturbed me more and I had negated my transformation immediately out of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been 3 days since I had left my village of Kraan. The terrible November storms had swept over the Russian steppe, driving great blankets of snow before them. Mother winter, Red October, had arrived in all its might and majesty! It was too cold to sleep, so I had trudged trough ankle-deep powdered ice. The night sky had almost been as bright and as luminescent as day, since the light of the full-moon had reflected off the shining ice of lakes and ravines and off the white snow on the ground. I could see clearly before me as I had walked, and in fact could have read a newspaper in the reflections of the frosted earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrostbite chewed at my extremities (my fingers were blue, my toes grey-purple); and the persistent pestering wind bit at my exposed neck and face ( You must understand the the winds of the motherland, comrade, to understand this phrase. The cold of subzero temperature winds on your bare flesh is so hurtful, that it literally feels like getting bitten before you can cover yourself up with cloth; hence the phrase: \"Biting wind.\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had not been prepared for this endeavor, this journey. True I didn't have much of a choice but to flee before the angry townsfolk, but still...I was ill equipped to survive for long. I had no proper winter-equipment or clothing. Only my rags and the clothes I had stolen from the 3 bullies. I was wrapped up beneath 10 sets of shirts and jackets, but they were worthless. I had pulled 6 pairs of socks over one another, before slipping them in my boots next to a handful of straw I had found in a nearby barn. An old cossack trick: to put woody material between your feet and solid earth. Straws were a poor conveyor of cold, just like rubber was a poor conveyor of electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no furs with me either, so I had found torn pieces of books and papers and had wadded them into my pockets and sides to fluff myself up as optimally as possible. The more separation between your insides and the exterior to the cold, the more likely the wetness of the falling snowflakes would penetrate all the way to your skin; because then the true freezing starts, let me tell you comrades! It was minus fifteen Celsius. A deathly temperature. But it was aggravated twofold by the blizzard gales and winds.<br>\r\nThis was one of the most hostile environments of earth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut yet I still stubbornly walked, or perhaps waddled and trudged, sometimes crawling forward. I refused to die just yet. Perhaps it was hardheadedness which had given me the energy to defy mother-nature, as my very eyebrows were sometimes covered with crystallite icicles.<br>\r\nSometimes the weather was calm. Then there would be grey-blue clouds hanging across the heavens and you could hear the wolves howl in the piercing silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had one thing to keep me from boredom. And trust me, boredom is deadly. It drives you insane in the frozen isolation!<br>\r\nIt was the transformation. I had an entire journey to myself to try and figure out how to replicate the morphing. Perhaps it was stupid of me, but I had REALLY wanted those giant batwings; maybe I could fly, then escape this frozen deathtrap...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo like a first-timer on his new bicycle, I had attempted to transform again, all the while I walked. I no idea what to do...and...for the 1st day I had produced no useful results. I just grunted and tried to concentrate like an imbecile as if that would have helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the second day I changed tactics; I tried to remember what I had done since the earlier transformation. At first I thought it was because I had been angered, that rage triggered the transformation; so I thought outraged and hateful things, but that had proved fruitless as well. By the afternoon...I had found the key...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't anger. It was calm. When the lead bully had harmed Marta, I had never felt so sure about helping someone besides my selfish self. I had been certain, completely calm about what I had to do then.<br>\r\nSo instead I thought tranquil thoughts and the gentle slow falling snows aided my mindset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike bursting a balloon, my talons and claws snapped from my appendages and my wings had shot out of my shoulder-blades. I had been so ecstatically cheering in glee at success that I would fail to notice, to my later vehement colourful-cursing, that I had ripped my clothes apart in the transformation. Throughout the remainder of the day I had practiced initiating and cancelling my morphing till I could perfect it and recall it at will. However I never seemed to be able to activate my invisibility anymore. But I was satisfied for the day and slept in an abandoned barn, in which I replaced my lost straws and resowed my torn gloves, boots(stolen) and jackets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the 3rd day I had suspected that the claws and wings were only a partial transformation. That the rest of my body could change as well. I thought this because sometimes the skin on my hands would darken a shade only to the fingers and at other times would darken all the way to my palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I spent the 3rd day walking, freezing to death, and continuing my controlled transformations and negations. Finally, without warning, I had felt hot all over. Not just in my extremities and back, as previously. Like my flesh and insides were candle wax being remolded by a sculptor. I knew it had been a complete shift this time, so I had rushed over to the nearest frozen water medium, a tiny pond; my excitement bubbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt...was not what I had expected. I don't know what precisely I had anticipated I would look like before that moment. But it most certainly wasn't...THIS! I was more embarrassed than horrified at what I saw and just reverted to my normal form before I could see any further...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was alerted into readiness by the barking of dogs. 4 sets of slays swept past from where I hid in a gully. This was but the 7th time an armed and organised group had passed me in the last 3 days. I grinned to myself. Obviously the inhabitants of Kraan wanted me dead badly. These people were most likely bounty-hunters after my hide.<br>\r\nBut I hadn't been a fool; I had hiked several detours to confuse any followers and had avoided the nearest villages and civilized structures, for I knew they would have waited me in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew these parts of the steppes. And I knew how to track and how to lose trackers on them. I wasn't about to be caught by some retard amateurs. I could easily blend into the snow and camouflage myself with my pale albino skin.<br>\r\nNow if only I could discover how to access my invisibility at will. Then I would truly be Hidden....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint was having fun. No seriously, he was having the time of his life! This had been one of the greatest hunts in his career! He had clearly underestimated that blistering albino kid! He had stuff to him. He wasn't stupid to be sure. For the kid had avoided every single major road and social center in this district. It was like he had disappeared from the face of the earth. Many bounty-hunters had already handed in the towel, saying that no one could survive in the frosted doom of such a blizzard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Flint knew better. He had come across zig-zagging tracks several times and would have successfully caught up, if the snowfall hadn't covered up the damn things! This kid was street-smart, and he knew exactly where he was heading. Flint could see this as the tracks led in a random, but relatively co-ordinated direction and didn't just divert spontaneously like someone lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcellent. This was where the sports truly started! Flint rewrapped his scarf around his neck and reared up his sledge-bike as if in a wheelie, then lanced off into the white wilderness...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was still searching for a more permanent shelter, distracted by the odd new warmth I had suddenly acquired from exploring my, shall we say, secondary form. At first, I thought the bat like wings, claws, and talons made me a monster but then I remembered seeing similar images in stone statues. What were they called... <i>gargoyles.</i> Yes, gargoyles, the stone guardians who chase evil spirits from the buildings and homes they rest upon. It might be who I am becoming, it might not be. It was just a guess, something to occupy my mind and keep out the madness of boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother storms was approaching from the north, I could see the low hanging clouds, heavy with snow and I could feel the wind kicking up as if to announce its arrival. Oddly, I did not seem to care as much as the frost bite was gone and the deadly cold seemed almost warm and welcoming, as if I were born to live within it. \"How strange this seems.\" muttering to myself, I said. \"When I first started out on my own, I was freezing, starving, gasping for breath...\" a small smile formed upon my face. \"Only when I embraced the thought of death did the warmth come, I wonder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts were interrupted by the snowy ground giving way underneath me. The hole I had made was too small to allow my wings to spread so to avoid falling in and I tumbled several feet into what looked like an underground cave. I picked myself up and looked around to find, to my surprise, an old church standing in the center of the cave! \"There is something you don't see every day.\" whispering, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity got the best of me and I approached the church to see the front door open. There, standing in the doorway was a tall, elderly woman. \"Welcome, Reiter.\" with an odd smile, she said. \"I have been expecting you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, bat like wings exploded from her back as claws grew from her finger tips and talons grew from her feet. I gaped at her, especially when I transformed in turn. \"Who are you!?\" whispering, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled sadly. \"I.. am your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I looked at her with only my curiosity holding back my annoyance. She was a head taller than myself, her skin the color of polished marble, with mid-back length raven hair and piercing green eyes that remained fixed upon my own. Her wings were folded down and in, clasped at the small talons at the end as if to show lack of aggression. Looking at her, she seemed fairly attractive but I had my doubts that she was truly my mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Chertovka, it means she-devil, though I am far from being one.\" calmly, the woman said.  \"You were given the name Daemon, Latin for demon, so Reiter fits as well; though I know that is far from the truth as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are my mother, why did you abandon me!?\" snapping at the woman, I demanded. \"Do you have any idea the hell I went through growing up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were not abandoned, you were stolen.\" firmly, the woman replied. \"You father, Monstrum, died searching for you.\" a single tear rolled down her face. \"If I had known where you were, I would have come for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you were expecting me, how?\" my face softening, I asked. \"I planned my journey carefully, avoiding any town so not to be captured or killed! I had no plans to fall down that hole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The instant you transformed, I knew you were still alive and I desperately wanted to come for you.\" daring a step closer, Chertovka said. \"Only, after being without me and your father for so long I feared you would flee from me or tear me asunder in your life long rage.\" smiling, she added, \"As I sensed you getting closer, I knew you were following a forgotten instinct and coming home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who stole me?\" tears forming, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bounty hunters.\" with a hint of icy anger in her voice, Chertovka replied. \"One in particular, named Flint. He was paid a handsome price to bring the child of the hidden to his client.\" sighing, she added, \"I can only guess how you got away but you can not escape the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is...?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are The Hidden, an angel of the night.\" taking a chance to touch my cheek, Chertovka said. \"We are not evil, just well equipped to deal with evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you live here?\" ignoring Chertovka's touch, for the moment, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I live here.\" simply, Chertovka replied. \"We are honor bound never to fight on holly ground of any kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A safe house.\" softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChertovka nodded. \"Will you please come inside and have a hot drink with me?\" as I touched her hand, she asked. \"I also have a warm bed you would like, if you wish to stay the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I decide to stay?\" confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChertovka cried slightly. \"I was not there when you needed me the most.\" sobbing, she replied. \"Its not my place to make you stay if you want nothing to do with me.\" she took my hand into her own. \"I'll be happy just to have seen your face, one more time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"I need more proof than just your word and a few facts before I believe you, Chertovka.\" giving her hand a slight squeeze, I said. \"I'll come inside but I want that proof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" now crying happily. \"I have all the proof you need inside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead the way then.\" a thin smile forming, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChertovka led me by the hand into the church and quietly closed the door behind us....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was rather fairly obvious we were related, if even she wasn't my mother. I didn't exactly meet a great deal of people with sets of leathery bat wings protruding from their backs, identical to my own, in life.<br>\r\nIt was clear she was what I was. Even if I didn't know what...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse still was that this stranger saw me in my full...transformation. Childish perhaps. But I still don't have the bravery to tell you even now what precise...changes it involved. I'll give you a hint. It didn't make me inhuman at all. But It made me very different from the torso up. I promise you idiots, you'll never guess what I mean. You'll all laugh and laugh hard, I assure you. So I'll let it stand for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI studied the woman as intensely as she looked at me. Flawless sleek jetblack hair snaked all the way past her shoulders to the small of her back. She definitely wasn't an albino, but her fair skin was as pale as the powdered snow, almost as pasty bleak as that of a corpse. I could further describe her skin to be like polished marble as it shone in contrast beneath her pitch black hair. Besides the wings and the claws and the talons, she was completely humanoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood as if waiting, with her hands crossed on top of one another in front of her lower waist, her wings were held tightly inwards as if to project the minimal size in order to show as little hostility as possible. She smiled again at me. It was a forlorn sad smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you're my mother?\" I ventured mistrustingly, still unsettled at having morphed without intention in her presence.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" she answered softly and simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know my...my name? How can you know my name. I was only called Reiter later in life, later in the orphanage.\" I said suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have always known of you, my child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI eyed her face to seek any hidden guile: \"And you expected me?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps this was a stupid question, but I was confused at that time: \"How...could you expect me?\"<br>\r\n\"I knew you would seek me out from the moment after your first shift, Reiter. Won't you come inside?\" she beckoned to the quaint little church behind her. \"It's warm and comfortable in there. I have hot drinks and food and a nice bed. You must be tired and hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made no move to accept her offer whatsoever; and stood as firm as rock. I didn't trust her as far I could throw her; and right now I didn't know exactly how far that was in light of my transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lying. I never sought anyone. I've been walking a plotted path for the last week. I've been walking where I wanted, and nowhere else. I haven't been seeking anything.\"<br>\r\n\"Yet...here you are, my child.\" she said soothingly. \"Strange that. Very strange indeed. I have not left this cave in over a year. A very peculiar coincidence that you would end up here in all places if you have not been seeking me, don't you agree my child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scowled at her. I didn't like the thought that my fate was out of my hands the least. She couldn't possibly be right. And yet...the last week...while I had chosen my routes across the iced surface of the steppes under the guidance of the night sky stars and constellations...it had always been because of a good feeling at choosing a certain direction and not because of any logistical logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI licked my blue lips and breathed, a wasp of smoke escaping my mouth in the subzero cold air.<br>\r\n\"And...you really...really are my mother?\" I repeated the question.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Reiter.\" she replied a second time without any loss of patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't very motherly.\" I accused suddenly.<br>\r\n\"No. I wasn't.\" she concurred, bowing her head and pursing her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where - were - you!?\" I spat at her through clenched teeth. \"If you are my mother, then why did you never come get me?!\"<br>\r\n\"I couldn't.\" she answered meekly.<br>\r\n\"I rotted on the streets!\" I shouted at her, my temper rising with my voice. \"I slept in the gutters! I ate what the leftover scraps that pet dogs wouldn't touch! I eluded dying by stoning 3 times! I waited for my family to get get me! If you truly are my mother, why did you never come?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had looked at her feet, all the while through my shouting, playing with her fingers, now biting her lips. Like an ashamed, guilty toddler being berated for having been caught doing something exceptionally naughty. I stopped only when I saw tears streaming down her shallow face and chin, to drop already frozen mid-fall before hitting the frosted cave floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face came back up: \"Please. Reiter. Although today is the first time I've seen your face, you must know that I've always lo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest convulsed as purple liquid, like grape wine, exploded from it and onto the floor. Following that immediately, a soul-retching deafening boom resounded and echoed throughout the enclosed hollow interior of the icecave. Both she and I watched in horror and shock as more of the purple liquid, which I now presumed to be her special blood, spread from the bullet-wound around to her tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she fell to her knees, the man that stood behind her holding the Dragunov-rifle, became visible, like the scenery of a mountainside becoming visible after the felling of a pine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were seven of them. They were all dressed like cossacks. With felt caps, mittens and boots; woolen trousers and furry jackets. They advanced on us with blood-lust in their walk and eyes. The other six were armed with Kalashnikovs which were wrapped in white camouflage bandages to prevent naked flesh from being frozen on the metal surfaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha Ha HA! Bullseye! Now you we can have a cold one! You owe me 5000 roubles, Yatsi! I got the witch first!\" jubilated the one wielding the Dragunov.<br>\r\n\"Shuddap Boris, and finish the runt too! And make it clean! I'm already freezing my can off!\" said one of the men armed with an AK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rushed over to my mother's side, where she gasped for breath. If our reunion had not brought me to an emotional-breakdown then our possible separation certainly did. Her wings flapped feebly beneath her in spasms. But I was given little opportunity for any any words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another 5000 says I can pop its right eyeball...\" said Boris and raised his rifle to my head, which was less than 20 yards from where he was standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see through the telescope that was trained on my petrified face, his eye leering evilly at my helpless form. So this was what it means to stare death literally in the face...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Flint held his head behind his sledge-bike's exhaust pipe, quite content at suffocating in the toxic carbon-monoxide fumes emanating from it for the privilege of having a source of warmth near his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the temperature was deathly out on the cold open russian steppes. Nothing could survive in this frozen hell without synthetic aid. This was the temperatures in which bears froze standing up. This was the temperatures in which iron plumbing pipes would burst open with such vehement force as the water inside them froze and expanded, that it looked as if there were explosives planted within them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had gotten to a point where taking a wiz was deadly to a man's manhood; instant cancellation to his future children. In these unholy temperatures a careless rub or scratch of one's ear or nose would see them quite literally breaking off of one's face. Flint had seen more than one man surprised at having his nose suddenly fall onto his lap after a pick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint held his Glonass-tracking PDA with a map of this area in front of him and tried to make out where on the good white earth he was as the blizzard wind flapped the paper in his grip. He pulled his scarf tighter and his trenchcoat firmer. The PDA indicated it was -22 degrees Celcius. He was 13 miles from the nearest village. How the hell the Reiter had kept surviving was beyond Flint. But the proof of the little albino kid's endurance was in the form of footprints that kept on going despite this bloody blizzard's attempt to cover up both the tracts and snuff out the life of the person making them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint had gained an enormous and eternal respect for the kid. He was very clever. He had avoided all main roads, skipped major and obvious settlements, and had thrown Flint and every other Bounty Hunter off of his track multiple dozen times. He had slept in abandoned barns and stole food from where it would not have been missed. This kid was born to survive the winter steppes. He was born to survive the Great Hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, the kid was interesting. His footprints in the soft snow even more so. Flint had seen them.....change...multiple times over, as if the boy had transformed. Normal at one point, then suddenly the feet looked as if they had grown massively elongated toenails, like talons. And alongside these talon-feetprints 2 miniature trenches followed; as if the boy had slid sticks beside him on both sides. This had puzzled Flint - a master tracker - for he had never seen anything like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the second day of the chase he figured it out. They were the marks of wings sliding in the snow! Yes, this boy was certainly not human. His supernatural survival of this frosted storm and the wing alternating transformed tracks made that obvious. The only question remaining was: what type of monster was he?<br>\r\nFlint wasn't a man to go into possible actions unprepared; he liked to know what type of beasts he faced for capture...or killing if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Flint thought he had it coined: the boy was an Ice-Demon. THEY had bat-like wings and taloned feet, not to mention inhuman resistance for the cold. In fact they thrived in sub-zero temperatures. They were legendary in these parts of the steppes. The peasantry spoke about them as mythical beings whom protected travelers on the icy roads in winter in exchange for fees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was one problem for this theory. As he sat behind his sledge-bike, Flint plucked out the wanted poster he had skied all the way back in Kraan. No, thought Flint as he looked at the Reiter's face, he doesn't look even the least bit androgynous. He was clearly a boy. Starved and ill treated, but unmistakably male. And there lay the problem. Ice-Demons were all female, they were all women.<br>\r\nGreat, so much for being prepared, if he found the boy. Whatever. He'll figure it out on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe high whine of massive propellers alerted Flint to danger. He threw a white camouflage blanket across his sledge-bike and dived into a nearby ditch for cover. 3 military hovercraft (they were basically large rubber dingy's with gargantuan fans mounted on their backsides instead of propellers; they were aquatic vehicles which could run on both water and land by sliding across the earth as the force of winds generated by the powerful fans pushed them at speeds exceeding 30mph) , converted to handle the slippery snows, slid past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they had seen Flint, they made no attempt to show so. Flint knew those basterds. They belonged to Boris Jorvaskr's outfit. <br>\r\nNow there were 2 things which Flint loathed most of all: empty vodka bottles and that jerk Boris. He was a mean infamous Bounty Hunter which had killed his fare share of men. In fact there were only 2 kinds of men whom Boris did not have conflict with: those who were dead and those he had never met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint hated Boris with all his being. Even more than the cold right now. In fact: his hatred of Boris Jorvaskr was so intense it thawed the very snow he was lying on right now. Boris had stolen more of Flint's bounty's than Flint cared to count. And in return he had given Flint no less than a dozen scars in payment. A deadlier, crueler, more merciless man than Boris, Flint did not know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow things had become personal: Flint would find the Reiter first, not as test of his pride as a professional monster-hunter or tracker; but just to spite Boris. That and the Reiter's survival now depended on Flint finding him first. While Flint prided himself as having one of the \"cleanest\" bounty records (i.e. he had never killed men when he could capture them alive), Boris prided himself as having killed each and every bounty he had ever encountered. Boris was the deadliest known bounty-hunter in the underworld...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint jumped on his sledge-bike and gunned the petrol, almost abusing the clutch, and launched forward with the energy of an inter-continental missile. He would not lose this bounty, the gods hear his oath!!<br>\r\nThe wind singed in his ears as he reached optimal velocity. But despite almost breaking his petrol pedal, he couldn't catch up with the hovercraft. They were made for these leg-height snows, his sledge-bikes not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse still than falling behind was the realization that the hovercraft was making a bee-line to somewhere; obviously they knew exactly where they were going. Flint dreaded that they already knew the location of the albino boy and were moving to corner him in.<br>\r\nDammit! Flint could not lose this rat race already! Not after having come so far after the Reiter already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint's distraction from the road cost him valuable reaction time...<br>\r\nHe saw the ravine too late, and swerved to miss it, causing him to fall off of his sledge-bike. Flint went down like a meteor into the hard snow. But it didn't end there. The ice broke beneath him and he tumbled even further: an ice shaft! And he was falling into one of its tunnels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tunnel was sloping down almost vertically, and Flint slid down it as if on water-worm amusement slide. Eventually, luckily for Flint, the slope evened out and and he slid to a standstill. Making sure that no bones were broken and no joints detached, Flint sat up slowly and massaged the bumps and sores that covered his entirety. Now that was one hell of a hard fall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint grimaced. He was somewhere underground. Well actually, under-ice. This frozen ice bunker could be kilometers deep. He stood up slowly and started shuffling in pain, but stopped as he heard voices, and lay down on his stomach again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint gasped and whistled softly inwards as he saw his tunnel open into a massive ice-cave. The interior was colossal. A derelict church stood on one side. Some of the surface's sunlight penetrated into this ice-cave, lighting up the vast interior with a pale blue light. 2 people stood facing one another in front of the church. Flint crawled closer to see them more clearly, then grinned!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBingo! The 2 were monsters! They had bat wings hanging from their backs! One was a beautiful young dark-haired woman, and the other which was a petite albino kid! The Reiter boy! Or wait...it was a boy, wasn't it?<br>\r\nThe frail albino child had shoulder length snowy hair and the hint of a youthful bosom on his...or her chest. He or she looked distinctly female. Flint dug out the wanted-poster and looked at the Reiter's face again. What? It looked like the Reiter if he was a girl.<br>\r\nWhat on earth? Nevermind, he'll figure it out later when he captured-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe distinct booming sound of a Dragunov-rifle going off assaulted Flint's ears as the woman with jetblack hair was shot in the chest from behind. Dammit! screamed Flint in his mind as he saw Boris walking up to the albino kid which held the wounded woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfastening a flamethrower from his back-sling, Flint jumped down from the ledge he was lying on and curled his finger against his firearm's  trigger...<br>\r\nPayback time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like the Pharoah whom suffered the wrath of God as he tried to chase after Moses into the split sea, so too did Boris see a pyre of fire decended on him and his men as Flint let loose the contents of his flamethrower. Boris was in the process of curling his finger on the Drugonov-rifle's trigger when flames and smoke rained from above. Deciding on survival before killing the Reiter, Boris dived sideways out of the leaping scorching fangs of the oiled fire-spray. 4 of his men weren't so lucky, and was gruesomely turned into flailing wailing human torches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished sliding down the ice-cave's side from the ledge, Flint jumped up heavily from the ice and let loose a second volley of fire into Boris's men; his grey trenchcoat was illuminated in the fiery light making it shift colour from orange to yellow to red. The man named Yatsi succeeded in letting off a barrage of his Kalashnikov assualt-rifle in Flint's general direction, but was blinded by the intensity of the heat. The shots, however, went close to home: creating sparks of vicious icy shrapnel that went airborne right next to Flint's head, forcing him to crouch-roll behind a massive postbox-sized frozen stalagmite for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint could see the Reiter, taking advantage of this miraculous diversion, dragging his mother back into the safety of a ditch which lined the road back to the little church. Good. At least the boy would not be harmed. Which was something Flint couldn't exactly say for himself as Kalashnikov fire raked the ice-stalagmite behind which he hid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn. Boris and his possey had recovered from his surprise attack too quickly. Flint had hoped to do more damage, but he had taken out less than half of the enemy bounty-hunters. Given sufficient time, planning and preparation Flint could wipe out a hundred men. But the Reiter would have died if he had not acted instantly. Now Flint was trapped behind this stalagmite. They would encircle him, corner him, and dispose of him in the next critical few seconds. Dammit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blackness of Boris's rifle barrel aimed at my head seemed to be the last sight that would greet me as I left the world. Then out of nowhere, without so much as a warning, the ice burned. It was as if the sun itself had fallen from the sky. I had never thought Ice could burn. It was after all bloody frozen water! But that day the ice burned and the men that tried to kill me burned with it. It wasn't a sight or something to be heard for children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that I had realized a third party bounty-hunter had joined in with the fun and had started a literal firefight. Now I was never one to be easily surprised. I only ever reacted. As a result of my upbringing on the dirt of the streets, being surprised when a one-time escape opportunity presented itself whenever sadistic bullies, gangsters or street-bangers had me in a vice was a no go. You had to be quick minded and quick footed to survive the streets. So without stopping to blink, I pulled my mother - something made easy by my enhanced strength in my transformed state - and made for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire, smoke, bullets and ice shrapnel filled the cavity of the ice-cave as I made my way through this hellstorm of fighting. It was only as I trudged on that I had realized I was invisible again. My hands were transparent and see-through, like a glass bottle. Strangely enough whatever I was in contact with also seemed to share my invisibility - that included my clothes and my mother which I dragged as she bled her purple blood. It seemed genuine extreme danger triggered the invisibility, but I had no time or mind to figure that out right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laid down my mother, fearing the worst of her wound, but while my face was the embodiment of despair, hers was that of total serenity. She smiled up at me: \"Don't fear my dear son. You can't be harmed in here.\" and she touched my cheek with an ice-cold hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she said something which made no sense at the time and made me think that she was delusional: \"No. Not at the hunters! At the ceiling!\" What??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flint, you son of a harlot!\" raged Boris with a demented voice in the silence of the cease-fire: \"I swear I shall dismantle you! We're going to flush you out and hang your stinking corpse for the wolves! Do you hear me?! I'm going to rip your head off and piss down your neck!\" Yatsi and the other men began to circle around the stalagmite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First you'll have to catch me, you guts-lover!\" Flint shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint smiled. This was it. The end of the line. There was no use in hiding his trump card if he died, now was there? He discarded his flamethrower - he wasn't going to need that right now - and nimbly assembled a miniature grenade-launcher from a stock, lock and enormous barrel he carried by the backpack. Time for plan B. Plan Bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint was just about to swing out from his sitting position to unleash 10 kilograms of nitro-sychron on Boris, when a distinct female voice in his head whispered: \"No. Not at the hunters! At the ceiling!\" The heck? What voice was that? Was Flint hallucinating from fatigue? But Flint's eyes were drawn to the roof of the ice-cave. A roof which was populated by scores of very heavy, very sharp, very fragile looking ice-stalactites! Oh hell yeah! Now that was a very sexy target if Flint ever did saw one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the advice of the voice he pressed the grenade-launcher to his shoulder, aimed 70 degrees upwards, and fired away... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYatsi and Boris looked upwards to see something akin to a firework lance into the air - a smoke trail following its path. Then it felt and sounded as if hell broke loose and the heavens showered down! The bomb imploded, and the stalactites exploded from the roof raining down a second shower of death. This time one made of ice. Ice in the form of half ton falling razor spikes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remainder of Boris and his men was buried beneath an avalanche of ice and dust. Their screams of terror drowned by the earthquake-equivalent noise. Flint grinned. He was always in a good mood when he mopped up the trash of the world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw what had happened. Yet I could not believe the sight that had met my eyes. But who could blame me? A new mountain of ice and snow inhabited the center of the ice-cave. My former tormentors buried beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I had childishly thought things were over at that point, I was sadly mistaken: for a hand, wielding a Drugonov-rifle ominously burst from the packed heap of ice, like the arm of a zombie emerging from its grave. Boris. He wasn't dead yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see the newcomer, whom they had called Flint, freeze in his tracks after he had made way for the ice debris heap. Obviously he had expected all the other bounty-hunters to have perished in that fall as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flint!!! You'll pay for that!! Oh yes, you'll pay!! I'm going to strangle you with your own guts for that!!!\" The man named Flint just stood still, almost acceptingly, inviting the inevitable unopposable death that awaited by the hands of Boris and his Drugonov. Chillingly, a reminder of how I had stared death in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made the decision then and there which of the 2 bounty-hunters I'd rather not have chasing me. I was still invisible, and used that to sneak up on the unsuspecting hunters. It was easy. Like taking bread from a rich baker on the street...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how'd you like to die, Flint?!\" said Boris, his Drugonov aimed squarely at Flint's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" said Flint, impassively: \"In my bed, at the age of 80, with 10 whores and twice that many bottles of vodka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always the comedian. I'm not going to miss your jokes. Bye you-\" I smashed a fist of claws into the cossack's felt cap and sent him reeling forward. He collapsed unconscious. Now for the other one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut dammit! My invisibility chose to wear of right at that vulnerable point. Oh shucks. I stared at the man named Flint and expected him to have a go at me, but to my surprise he just dug out a pipe and lit it. Sucking and puffing the end he then said: \"So you're the Reiter. Huh. This is...not what I was expecting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerks are going to laugh. Just laugh, I could care less right now, for I am to tired after that ordeal. Do you remember when I told of my full transformation shocking me so badly? And that you jerks would laugh at when I told what exactly it involved from the waist up? It was more embarrassing than horrifying. The claws, talons and wings were all that indicated I was a monster. The rest? Sigh. <br>\r\nThe rest was that of a girl. When I had seen my reflection on a frozen pond the first time, I was puzzled to see an albino girl staring back at me. It peeved me to no end when I had discovered I was the reflection. Long hair, an oval face, a waist, and worst of all: a bosom. And I had to endure all that in silent shame in front of this stranger. Not to mention I had to do so in front of my mother earlier. My full transformation was me as a girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" said Flint. \"I don't have time for names, but if you really must call me something: Friends call me Flint. Enemies call me the Pyromancer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the Hidden.\" I said suddenly, before I could stop myself; liking this stranger slightly more. Someone who also didn't put value into true names<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, you have a title too. Fancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to hurt me?\" I asked tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint looked at me sideways: \"I'm not going to do anything to you. You just took down Boris. Something I have failed to do for over 30 years. You're free to walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just stared at him mistrustingly; who is this lunatic? My mother's voice interrupted our bizarre conversation: \"Flint? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems the universe was far from done when it came to playing pranks on me. There stood my mother, unharmed, untouched; her wound completely vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint's pipe fell from his mouth as he gasped: \"Chertovka?\"</span></div></div>",

To a human, it was clearly fatal and I could not see her breath in the chilled air. My one chance to learn why I was abandoned, why I had to suffer as I did growing up were all taken away by a shot in the back. \"Mother..\" whimpering, I muttered. \"No....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to mourn over my loss but the sound of a trigger being pulled reached my ears and I reared my head up to see a bullet firing from a Dragunov-rifle! Instinctively, I swiped at the bullet, not knowing how that would do and was surprised to see two halves of the bullet flying harmlessly by on either side of my head. I had cut the bullet in half with my claws!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" yelled the man with the rifle. \"I could I have missed!?\" he tried to fire again only the gun jammed. \"Shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was my chance to make the man who murdered my mother pay the price. I did not want to kill him, just leave him with the same chances I had. I gently laid Chertovka down onto the snow then turned to the man before spreading my bat like wings and giving an ear piercing roar. The man jumped, struggling with his rifle but paused as I vanished from sight. <i>\"Who is the prey now, you bastard!?\"</i> flying towards the man, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI landed hard in front of the man, making myself visible as I roared and swatted the rifle from his grasp. The man responded by coming at me with a hunting knife, which I was expecting, and countered by using my claws as a blade and engaged him in sword play. \"You dare toy with Boris, demon!?\" furious, the man screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not answer the man as I was moving the fight to his three hover craft. Once there, I slashed at Boris and he dove aside to avoid being gutted by my claws. Only I was not trying to slash him, I drove my claws into the rubber tubing of the hovercraft, creating loud and satisfying pop before air rushed out of the giant tub. \"No!\" furious, Boris screamed. he then turned to me. \"I'll hang your hide on my trophy wall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to continue with the fight but a sudden warmth reached my feet and I quickly took to the air as the ice below us and the hovercraft gave way. The three machines fell into the ice cavern, landing onto a frozen underground lake and breaking through into the frozen waters below. I heard the man screaming as they struggled to pull themselves out but hypothermia hits quickly in Siberia and it hits hard; their chances were not good. Boris, to my surprise, managed to escape the fall by driving his knife into the ice and used it to climb back up. Just as he pulled himself to the surface, I grabbed his hand and held him off the ground. Boris slashed at me with his knife but I effortlessly stopped him with a single claw. \"You have a choice, Boris.\" coldly, I said. \"Either take those who survived and walk to the nearest village to beg for help and have a chance to live or stay here and fight me, which I guarantee you will die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I threw Boris away from me before flying up and diving back down to Chertovka. There, to my shock and much relief, I found her alive! She was sitting up smiling at a man who had knelled before her, scowling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not recognize you at first, you Koschie.\" annoyed, the man said. \"Had I know it was you, I would have taken the first shot myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have not seen you in sixteen years, Flint.\" grinning, Chertovka said. \"You're still cute when you're angry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you're alive!\" landing next to her I exclaimed. I then gave the man, Flint a scowl. \"You know this man!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChertovka nodded. \"Reiter, I would like you to meet Flint.\" smiling, she said. \"He and my husband, Monstrum fought over me when we were teenagers.\" she then giggled. \"He was angry when he found out I was a 'she demon'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else would you call your self!?\" almost scowling, Flint asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChertovka winked at me then replied, \"Unique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not help laugh then suddenly turned serious. \"You are here to kill us too, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was paid and sent out to capture you.\" sighing, Flint said. \"That was before I knew your mother was Chertovka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that matter?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promised Monstrum I would not kill you or Chertovka.\" flatly, Flint replied. \"He saved my life a while back and I owed him a debt of honor.\" he sighed then added, \"I took you from your mom because I thought you were born normal, in need of a normal family....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw red and jumped to my feet. \"You!\" screaming, I said. \"You were the one who left me at that hell hole of an orphanage!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sara was 13, and Iris, a bit of a surprise, was 5.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had graduated two weeks before my birthday. My Journalism studies, along with my time on the school paper, had gotten me accepted into my safety school. All my life, I planned to be a TV reporter when I grew up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, I needed a backup plan, for unexpected reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up on the morning of my 18th birthday, wondering what would happen today. I had seen a strange car parked in front of the house once, and I wondered if it was for me. It wasn't a flashy car by any means, but it would be good enough for a first car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got dressed, I noticed my clothes seemed a little looser. I wasn't on a diet, and there were no recent changes in my exercise routine, so I wondered why. I hoped it wasn't serious: I had my whole summer, my whole life, ahead of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, my eyes fell on my growth chart on the door frame, the pencil markings showing how much I'd grown over the years. The last, tallest mark was when I had stopped growing. On a whim, I stood against the door frame, held my hand at the top of my head, and looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I triple-checked that my feet were together and flat on the floor, my knees straight, my back straight. I marked my height with a pencil. Then I looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a tape measure, I checked to see if all the marks were right. It seemed unlikely that anyone would alter the marks just to play a prank on me, on the off chance I would decide to measure myself, but not compared to the alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe upper mark, from when I was fourteen and a half, was 5', 8\", the same as I had been since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mark I'd just made was 5', 7\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had somehow become an inch shorter.</span></div></div>",

I was helped near the end, and now I'm paying it forward, just as you will someday, Kylie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know I was shrinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to explain.

It happens to random people. The only consistency is that it happens to people between the ages of 18 and 38.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky me, I got it on my birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Mom said, \"but we're all forgetting something.

You're only going to become more dangerous to her.\" She held up her cane. \"I didn't always need this. My first husband was sure that he could take care of me, and keep me safe. He believed that right up until he gripped me <i>just a little too hard.</i> I want to spare Kylie that. Do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shut her eyes at that.

After that, she comes with me.\" With that, Marty slipped away from us.</span></div></div>",

Barbie's clothes were too rough on my sensitive skin, so Mom cut up one of Dad's silk handkerchiefs and made a couple of dresses for me. We sat around talking, reminiscing about our favorite experiences together, trying to ignore how the hem was steadily creeping down my legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I had shrunk to 8 inches, Mom switched me to a smaller dress, and we all knew that time was also growing short. \"I'm going to miss you oh so much, Kylie,\" Jillian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here, girlfriend,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd was next. \"I'll never forget you, Kylie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better not. I put too much work into making you the perfect boyfriend. Have a good life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara and Iris couldn't stop crying. \"It's okay, guys,\" I told them. \"I'm not dying, I'm just going somewhere else. Maybe I can come back here sometime, like on my birthday. If I can, I'll be here, and you can tell me all about what you've done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad knelt down. \"Do you think you can take a couple of giant faces close up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both kissed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they set me down, I heard a small cane clicking on the hardwood floor. \"I think it's almost time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That it is,\" Marty said. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there is such a thing.

But I promise you, you will come to love our world. What was plain among the big people will appear wondrous to you now. If your soul craves adventure, you can find it wherever you look. The necessities are not things to be earned among us, but come easily, and are freely given.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't tell how far down we were actually going, but it seemed to me that we went a long way. Finally, we reached an archway, and we went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no expectations about what I would see, but I was still awestruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way up to my former home let out onto a space that seemed to me the size of a grand concourse. The whole thing was lit by Christmas lights. Where a statue might have stood in the world above, an old G.I. Joe stood. A Barbie stood at the opposite end. People went this way and that, looking not like people downtown going to work, but like children at the State Fair, taking in the spectacle around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomebody spotted us and shouted \"Newcomer!\" As more people saw me, the chorus of \"Newcomer!\" grew, mixed with cries of \"Welcome!\" Those closest to me would embrace me, or kiss me, or just hold my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wept tears of joy. After two days of shrinking, here was a place where I finally fit. Everything looked and felt right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven finding that I was no longer 7 inches tall, but a fraction under 6 inches, didn't bother me. My size didn't separate me from people anymore, it united me with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was home.</span></div></div>",

It would be better for me to find out where I was sleeping before I was too tired to remember where it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn led me even farther down. \"The hub is where we work,\" she said, \"and greet newcomers like yourself. Our homes are farther down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we descended, I heard the laughter of children. \"Maria isn't quite the youngest,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's the youngest to be employed,\" Quinn explained. \"Because she shrank so young, and so small, we treat her as an equal. Otherwise, she would be down here with the other children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the hustle and bustle were parents playing with children, children playing with each other, children sitting quietly by themselves. I learned that, after school, the children were encouraged to develop their own skills and interests. In this way, they could find the calling that suited them. All careers were equal among the Little People: the artist was as valued as the gatherer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little girl bumped into me. \"Excuse me,\" she said, looking up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're excused,\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen you before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm new here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, newcomer.

I was in a world where I fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the paper and lead that Daria had given me, I decided to do some drawing. I used to draw up above, and I had been told I was good. But I doubted whether I could make a living at it. Being a TV reporter would put food on the table. Here, though, things were different.</span></div></div>",

In the hall was a small group of In-Wall residents singing lullabies as they slowly walked by like carolers at Christmas time. I looked down the hall and saw other residents opening their door to listen with a few joining them, adding their voices to the chorus. Among them was Daria who had given me the paper. I held up my drawing and she paused to admire it. A taller woman, whom I assumed was Daria's mother, paused as well and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, newcomer.\" Softly, she said. \"I am Sky... You draw very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Blushing, i said. \"Is this done every night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSky giggled. \"Yes, we sing to our residents to help them sleep as the giant world can make very frightening noises in the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giants fear noises in the night too.\" Ruefully, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I...\" Blushing, Daria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and handed her the paper.

The bed was surprisingly comfortable and I was soon asleep to the soft sounds of the lullaby carolers. \"What a strange, wondrous place.\" Yawning, I muttered. \"I wonder what surprises await me tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the night, I was awakened to the sounds of stomping, moaning and metal grinding. It was like a scene from a haunted house movie. Only, with it being my first night as an In-Wall, I was able to determine what the noises were. Dad walking around with his heavy steps, mom muttering in her sleep, and the water heater kicking in. \"I can only imagine how frightening those sounds are to one born into this tiny world.\" Sleepily, I said. \"Maybe there is a way to help the little ones understand the sounds better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I was sound asleep...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When it stopped, Quinn led me out one doorway into a spacious room where several people were sitting behind large canvases painting various images of life within In-Walls. \"Welcome to the Artists' Garret, Kylie.\" Calmly, Quinn said. \"Here, all artists are free to hone their talents for the benefit of the community.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We share our work with artists from other communities.\" Smiling, one artist said. \"With them, we offer written news coverage that ties to the paining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are reporters too...\" Curious, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fact Tellers.\" Kindly, another artist corrected. \"In a world of giants, any opinion could spark a panic. Only the facts are allowed. If we do not know, we must say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at what one artist was painting and smiled. \"The stomping is my father making his rounds to ensure all is safe before going to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe artist returned my smile. \"Welcome, newcomer.\" Patiently, he said. \"The shaking this painting refers to are earthquakes. The giants cannot detect anything below a point one on the Richter scale but we can feel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earthquakes... here?\" Surprised, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I said that, the room shook and I flinched seeing dust falling from the ceiling of the tiny nook in the attic. \"Our scouts and gatherers have determined that the shaking is due to a water main that is close to rupturing.\" Serious, Quinn explained. \"We are sending an alarm to Under-Streets so they can evacuate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thought, I asked, \"Can we contact my family, I mean the giants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will that do?\" Curious, another artist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dad knows the people who work on the underground water lines.\" Serious, I explained. \"If I can sound the alarm to him before the line ruptures, the workers can repair it before any damage is done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe artists stared at me for a moment before moving to a new canvas and painting as if they were possessed. \"Um... was it something I said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one has ever thought to sound an alarm to the giants.\" Softly, Quinn said. \"I do not know if it can even be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it will save lives, I have to try.\" Insistent, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will take you to them.\" Calmly, Travis Minuscule said. \"You can come with us when we go on our next raid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded as Quinn turned to the artists. \"Send the alarm but add that we may have a plan to prevent the rupture from happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe artists nodded and returned to their work as I turned to Travis. \"When do we leave to the world of the giants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now.\" Serious, Travis replied. \"Who do you want to contact?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stepping out into the living room, I saw that Mom was watching game shows. \"How do we get her attention away from that thing?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this,\" I told him. Crossing the vast expanse of living room floor, I began tugging on Mom's pant leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom ignored what I was doing for so long that I began to question the strength of my shrunken arms. Finally, with a muttered \"What in the world... ?\", she bent down, and looked me right in the face. \"<i>Kylie?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mom,\" I said with a wave. \"This is Travis Minuscule, a scout and gatherer for the Little People. Travis , this is my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do, ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Minuscule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here on an important mission, Mom. The Little People have detected a water main that's close to breaking. If Dad can get it fixed, he'll save a city of Little People.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is the main?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right over Under-Streets,\" Travis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't know where that is. Wait here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom got up and went to the kitchen. I heard her rummaging through the junk drawer. \"Here it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned with a map of the city, and spread it out on the floor. \"We're here,\" she said, pointing to one spot on the map. \"Where is the main?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis studied the map, following a route he'd taken who knows how many times, then pointed. \"Here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked at the spot where Travis stood, then picked up the phone and called. \"Hi, Frank. Kylie came to see me. Apparently, there's a water main at 4th and Chestnut that's close to breaking.\" She listened. \"And it wouldn't do wonders for the Little People near there. I'll tell you all about it when you come home. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging up, Mom told us, \"A broken water main would cause considerable property damage, and be an inconvenience to every giant who lives there. He's glad you told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Kylie's idea,\" Travis said. \"She said she could reach out to you and avert disaster, and she did. This after telling us what the sounds we hear coming from this place mean. I thank the fates that made her one of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Mom could see me blushing at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could we devise some way to contact each other,\" Mom asked, \"for less time-sensitive matters? I would feel better, knowing my daughter wasn't so far away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the service you have done for us today,\" Travis said, \"I believe it could be arranged.\"</span></div></div>",

Take note of everything we are low on and bring it to Kylie... our first giant ambassador!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis stunned me. \"Giant ambassador?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is extremely rare that a little maintains ties with their giant family.\" Smiling, Travis said. \"As you are still close to your family, it makes perfect sense that you be the one to contact them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that then raised my hand. Everyone paused to listen. \"My mother has promised to replenish our stockpile.\" Smiling, I announced. \"Do not hold back... anything you feel we need, put on the list. I will offer what funds I have left behind to cover the expenses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers rose from the crowd and they fanned out, checking every last storage room for what might be needed. Within minutes, the common hall was empty. \"We will have much to celebrate tonight.\" Smiling, Quinn said. \"Your fast thinking saved an entire community and now your family's generosity will help sustain ours for months to come if not longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just doing my part.\" Blushing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going well above and beyond what is expected.\" Smiling, Travis said.

I would be honored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis smiled, nodded, then ran off to make a list of his own.

What surprised me was that most of their current needs could be found in my old bedroom. It was everything from art supplies to water. I helped the Artists' Garret put the list together on a paper mom could read and where to leave it all. We then placed it into the communication drawer before pulling a lever. Inside the house, a small red strip appeared above the drawer, looking like a piece of nicked paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now all we can do is wait.\" Sighing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the time waiting by drawing portraits of people at their request.  Daria and her mother, Sky had apparently been telling people of my talents. I had done ten portraits in all before excited shouts and cheers were heard approaching the common hall. We all turned to see the scouts and gatherers, lead by Travis march in with a bounty of food and supplies. The first paraded trip brought small bottles of water, forty-eight of them to be exact. \"This will completely replenish our fresh water wells!\" Tearfully, one woman celebrated. \"No more boiling water for a while!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis took off the lid of one bottle with a grunt and pushed it over, sending the sparkling water into a clean metal bowl. A number of In-Walls came to it and took in the refreshing water into their mouths, cheering and crying at the same time. \"There is a high metal content in the pipes.\" Softly, Quinn explained. \"Not a real bother for giants but for us it can be lethal unless we boil the water first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never really thought of it.\" Worried, I said. \"Perhaps I can contract dad and have him put in a filter to make the water cleaner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be a big help.\" Smiling, Quinn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next trip brought dozens of individual serving foods in a variety of brands such as cold cereal, potato chips, instant oatmeal and much more. The adults were cheering and hugging one another. Travis paused, smiling tearfully. \"We normally only take enough to get by day to day.\" softly, he said. \"What your mother had left for us to find will last for months... Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that. \"Thank my mom, she tend to mother everyone she meets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrip after trip, the bounty came in with everything on the list and some no one dared to ask including medical supplies. Upon seeing them, Quinn turned to Travis. \"Take those directly to the infirmary.\" Serious, she ordered. \"Dr. Will-heart will be elated to see such a large supply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped hearing that. \"Are there a lot of In-Walls injured?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more than in any other community.\" Gently, Quinn replied. \"It's just that medical supplies are hard to reach...\" She smiled. \"This supply will be put to great use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the last trip came through, the entire community was a buzz of their good fortune. \"Fellow In-Walls, tonight, we celebrate!\" Smiling, Quinn announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers rose from the crowd and a number of In-Walls toasted me with tin cups of sparkling water.

None of this has gone unnoticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sat at the desk in my new office, Quinn asked, \"What would you like, Madame Mayor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A piece of paper, and some lead.

But I am obligated to meet with anyone who shrinks into our population, as I learned from Quinn when I left home. If I have other duties, I'll learn of them on the job. And I won't screw things up too badly, because my term is only one month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're probably wondering how I got elected. Well, believe it or not, you played a major part in it. Down here, we hear noises coming from the house above us, and many of us were terrified of them. But I grew up in that house before I grew down, so I knew it was just Dad checking the house, you talking in your sleep, and the water heater. That knowledge, combined with the lullaby you sang to Iris, put people at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other factors came about because I left the house on such good terms. Many of us were harmed by the big people in our lives, or were neglected as we shrank. But, because you have been so good to me, I had the idea of contacting the world of giants to fix the water main. And, because you offered to buy us what we need, and you kept your word, we have everything we need.

Concerned, Quinn and I ran to the hub where an In Wall resident was being rushed to the infirmary. \"What happened?!\" Worried, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy Tiny was replacing the battery back up systems when he accidentally electrocuted himself.\" Wincing, Dr. Will-heart said. \"He will live but his hand was badly burned in the accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Will-heart was an older man with bushy eyebrows and mustache that accented his gentle blue eyes. Tommy Tiny was around my age with short brown hair and brown eyes that were filled with tears from both pain and sorrow. \"I had done the battery replacement a thousand times.\" Crying, he said. \"I don't know what went wrong... I'm such a novice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shushed Tommy quiet. \"The difference between an expert and a novice is that an expert has made more mistakes.\" Calmly, I said. \"Also, an expert learns from his mistakes where a novice just quits and walks away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy took my words in and smiled slightly. Taking her cue, Quinn added, \"No one is faster at replacing the batteries than you, Tommy. One mistake out of a thousand is a very good record.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Day or night, you and your teammates are on the job when the power goes out.\" Added another. \"We never have to worry of being in the dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even with a burned hand, you finished the job.\" Chiming in, another said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne after another, the residents of In-Walls spoke their praises and well wishes to Tommy Tiny as he was carried to the infirmary. \"You have nothing to worry or be sorry about, brave resident.\" Calmly, I said. \"Accidents come to us all. We learn from them and become better people from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Tommy was in the infirmary, Quinn smiled at me. \"You did well on your first day as mayor.\" Kindly, she said. \"We have long believed that good and evil exists in each one of us and that giving in to one's bad nature is a cry for help.\" She motioned to the people around us. \"So we affirm the good nature of the wrongdoer, in hopes he or she will correct their behavior before it gets serious. This is called <i>ubuntu</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded at that then turned to Maria Speck. \"Any news from the telegraph?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nodded. \"The people of Under-Streets are grateful for the quick action to repair the water main.\" Smiling, she replied. \"They also gave word of a newcomer to their community, a homeless teenager named Micheal Fawn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear of joy fell from my eye as I knew the homeless boy. My family had offered to take him in many times but he refused to be a burden to anyone. \"He is homeless no longer; he is now a member of the Under-Streets community.\" Happy, I said. \"Send word that we also extend our welcomes to the newcomer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smiled and hurried off to send the message.

I looked about and found that the family was playing Karaoke before Jillian came running to the house and to my fortune, the microphone was lying on the floor. I turned to Travis. \"Can we get to the mic without getting trampled?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis nodded. \"There is an access port just behind the speaker we use as a shortcut to the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis led me back through the winding halls to the access port where the microphone was in sight. I hurried up to it and covered my ears as I spoke into it. \"Um... mom... this is Kylie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and dad turned to the Karaoke machine and spotted me by the microphone. \"Hey, honey.\" Tearfully, mom said. \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes and no.\" Wincing, I said into the mic. \"We have strong evidence that Jillian is about to shrink just as I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian gasped. \"Are you certain....\" Softly, she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a sixth sense about such things.\" Stepping up to the mic, Travis said. \"We weep for your family, Miss Warner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" Crying, Jillian said. \"Do- Do you know when this is going to happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be our height within a few hours.\" To my surprise, Travis said. \"Strong emotions such as sadness or anguish greatly speed up the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I need to do before I...\" Wincing, Jillian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cover your tracks.\" After a thought, I said. \"Just as the world thinks I have passed away, so must the world think of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJillian nodded, tears flowing like rivers as dad walked off to contact his attorney.

We will keep an eye on them and keep you informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove always, Sara and Iris.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the letter was a simple but strange symbol that looked like an flower made from infinity signs. \"Who could know about us?\" Worried, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to bring it to Quinn's attention who, upon reading the letter, let out a worried sigh. \"It's Lotus.\" Softly, she said. \"They are a little known research group obsessed with the strange and unusual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they know about us?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn shook her head. \"Fortunately, no.\" More calmly, she replied. \"I believe they are more interested in the strange disappearances in this area over the passed week.\" She shook her head. \"There were stories circulating last year about giants shrinking due to a mysterious comet but they are just that, stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is how you learned of them.\" Guessing correctly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuinn nodded. \"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knotted my jaws in decision. \"We will need to alert the other communities to exercise extreme caution when out on their raids until we are certain they have left the area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wise decision, madame mayor.\" Calmly, Quinn said. \"We will send word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, I decided to pay Jillian a visit at her apartment to find her looking worried. \"What's wrong?\" Concerned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some strange people came to our door, asking about my disappearance.\" Frowning, Jillian said. \"Dad had already sent word that I had passed away and sent them to curb with a very convincing act but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the fact strange people asked.\" Sighing, I said. Jillian nodded. I explained who they were then added, \"Fortunately, they do not know of us, to my knowledge. We are sending word to be extra cautious until they leave the area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope its soon.\" Wincing, Jillian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Nodding, I agreed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What's the message?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked around about any information anyone had about Lotus, and I found some people who used to work with them. They said that Lotus isn't a bunch of sadists or crazies; they're dedicated scientists, interested in advancing human knowledge and the human condition. You know, so we don't have to worry about being dissected, or them using us to try to shrink the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be so, Maria, but I won't have my people put themselves in danger. I'll modify my earlier directive to say that no hostile action should be taken, but, again, they should be avoided if it's at all possible. Thanks for the message. You went above and beyond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that taken care of, I went about my mayoral duties, which mainly consisted of talking to the people of In-Walls. I felt it was only fair, since they had voted for me. I got to hold a baby, and I had a talk with a very pregnant woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy walk took me to the edge of In-Walls, where I saw what I assumed was a route to one of the other communities of Little People. With the distances involved, it was certainly a good thing we had a working telegraph system. Still, I was sure that a way to get there physically would come in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I saw it: a car, about our size. It was covered with a thick layer of dust. I recognized it as a plaything I had discarded years ago, an old radio controlled car that I couldn't get to work right. How did it get down here?</span></div></div>",

Sara left instructions on how to change the battery out safely in her letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kylie, the RC car you mentioned was a recalled model which had a battery pack that never held a good charge. The company made it that way to sell more but it backfired as it worked with pretty much any RC car battery pack on the market. This pack will keep the car moving for a long time to come and it is already fully charged. Included is a list of instructions I hope will help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll our love,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sent word to Tommy Tiny who helped me change out the battery and safely dispose of the old one before checking all of the other controls. \"Everything looks ready.\" Smiling, I said. \"Who is going to give it a test run?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll test her.\" Calmly, Travis said. \"There are two seats... want to visit Under-Streets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Quinn who nodded. \"We will all visit Under-Streets eventually.\" Smiling, she said. \"You might as well do it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded in return and turned to Travis. \"Let's get going then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, Travis was driving the modified RC car through what seemed to be an impossible twisting maze of tunnels. I must admit, I was a bit frightened but Travis was surprisingly calm. \"We use cat urine in these tunnels to keep the various rodents away from the ones we use.\" Serious, he said. \"Gathering it, however is a dangerous task left only to those willing to volunteer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded though I was still worried as Travis brought with him a homemade crossbow with small modified needles for arrows. <i>\"Even in their world, weapons seem to be a dark necessity...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, we had arrived at Under-Streets. Only I was not prepared for what I found there... I was inside what looked like an old subway station only in my size! Everything looked recreated from pictures I had seen online. Seeing my reaction, Travis chuckled. \"The people of this community dug out and built this city with their bare hands.\" With a hint of pride, he said. \"Much like we did with In-Walls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We like it.\" Approaching us, a young woman said. \"I am Tonya Freckle, this month's mayor of Under-Streets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kylie Burke.\" Smiling, I said. \"I am this month's mayor of In-Walls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonya nodded. \"Welcome. Is this an official visit or a social call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little of both.\" Calmly, I replied. \"We have news about Lotus, the strange giants poking around on the surface.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tonya could respond, we were all greeted by a chorus of \"Newcomer!\" and \"Welcome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled and prepared myself for another welcoming party.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Vampires, werewolves, mummies, witches, warlocks, mad scientists, zombies...Mythological monsters such as Medusa, Hydra, Centaur... Giant monsters such as King Kong, Godzilla, Rodan... the only limit is your imagination. The goal of the story is how the character reacts and copes with becoming a Monster Child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rules are simple....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Keep this at Rated PG13.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. <b>Do not kill the main character.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. <b>All chapters are to be done in first person.</b> (Me, I, I'm, etc.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. <b>The main character must be a teenager or younger!</b> Remember the title. Keep the main character young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. <b>Make a story out of the change!</b> The character you choose will be slowly transforming into a monster of mythology or other legends. Try to describe the transformation, what senses your character develops, what tastes for food they experience, etc. How people will react to the changes, if they notice at all, or the character hides it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. <b>Know the monster you are creating!</b> Extreme examples: werewolves do not have wings and vampires do not get a tan on the beach. Let's try to keep the stories real. The only exception to this rule is if you can come up with a reason for the oddity, such as a magical ring that protects the vampire from the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. <b>Make your monster gentle!</b> He or she started as a regular teenager. If you can come up with something extreme that throws him or her over the edge, I will allow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Other characters are welcome. Add in monsters, humans, half humans... <b>Go for it!</b> Just do not break any of the above rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. If you have any questions, E-mail me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Have fun...<br>\r\n</td>",
