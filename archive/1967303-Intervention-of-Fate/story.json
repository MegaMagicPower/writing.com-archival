            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I suppose that I should introduce myself. My name is Alec. I'm 15 years old. I have layered, white, jaw-length stylish hair, fair skin, and piercing red eyes, being born an albino. I have smooth-yet-sharp facial features that give me an attractive appearance. My build is lean yet muscular, and I stand about about 5\" 10'. I often adorn a long black overcoat made of a tough leather flattened enough to be flexible (Think Organization 13) over a long sleeved white shirt. I wear black jeans tucked into tall combat boots. On my left hand, I always wear the heavy family ring that had belonged to my father before me. It is a thick and heavy silver, with engraved symbols and letters in an unknown language.<br>\r\nAnyways, unto where I was born, I honestly can't say. All I know is shortly after I was born, both of my parents died in some sort of accident that was kept a secret from me. I never even knew what they looked like, as no pictures of them survived, much less their names. As for myself, I had always had a rather dull personality, with an icy-calm outer armor that I always wear. If you would ask anyone who knew mw what I was like, they would describe me as antisocial, quiet, slightly bored, and dryly sarcastic.<br>\r\nI was raised by my aunt in Cerulean city in Kanto. I had wanted to be a Pokemon trainer, but my aunt never wanted me to be one. She always insisted it was that because she was afraid that I would get hurt like my parents before me, but I had my doubts. I often asked her about them, but she never liked to talk to me about my parents. Due to my natural quietness, I had very few friends, so I wanted to befriend Pokemon to ease my loneliness, which to my ire, never happened.<br>\r\nTo make things worse, girls left and right practically threw themselves at me because of my good looks, but I was never interested in any of them. I wanted to have real friends, to travel the world, and to one day, fall in love! Fed up with the monotony of everyday life, one day I decided to go exploring in the famous Cerulean Cave, hoping to catch a powerful Pokemon on my own, thinking then that my aunt would have to let me be a trainer. What I didn't know was that what I would find in that cave would change my life forever...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was far to impatient to wait until later to go into the cave. I had already had 99 Max Repels and 99 Ultra Balls from the PokeMart in the city (I saved a lot of my money) so I could repel any weak Pokemon and catch the stronger ones that I wanted to. I snuck out of my house and walked across the shallow river to the cave that no one ever went into for some reason. As I walked into the cave, I swear I could hear a voice in my head whisper \"Turn back...\" I looked around, but saw no one or nothing that could have made the words. I then sprayed myself with a Max Repels and took out a flashlight so I could see and navigate the cave, and not experience any trouble, like vicious wild Pokemon. And, in the event that I would get lost, I had many escape ropes. Feeling confident in my intelligence, I then continued to explore for several hours, turning and re-turning different ways, wading through flooded sections of the cave, and pushing many heavy boulders out of the way until finally, I reached what must be the end of the labyrinth. I looked up and saw a natural outcrop of rock with a ladder reaching up to the ceiling. Looking down at the platform I saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I stared carefully at the pokemon, squinting my eyes in a struggle to see it with the little amount of light that was in the cave, although I could tell that it was bipedal, and roughly the size of a slightly short human. The temptation to sigh in disappointment was far too much of a risk, in case it scared off the pokemon. Instead, I sat down and continued to stare at it as it hovered up and down slowly in the same space, absolutely fascinated by it. It was clear that the pokemon had it's legs crossed and it's hands kept somewhat away from it's body, it had to be meditating. A psychic pokemon, perhaps? Curiosity eventually took over as I got into a crouching position and slowly stalked forward, keeping as hidden and calm as possible to not alert whatever pokemon it was. Finally, I stopped and stared at it again. It was a.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A pokemon I had never seen before hovered before me. It was a bipedal, humanoid Pokemon with some feline features. It was primarily gray with a long purple tail. On top of its head are two short, blunt horns. There was a strange tube that extends from the back of its skull to the top of its spine, bypassing its neck. It had a defined chest and shoulders, which to me, resembled a breastplate. The three digits on each hand and feet had spherical tips. Its tail is thick at its base, but thinned out before ending in a small bulb. I stared at in awe, for once, not sure as to what to do. Then, unnervingly, the Pokemon slowly opened its eyes, which were a vibrant purple color, and affixed its meaningful gaze directly at me. What happened next?</span></div></div>",
