            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Science has often asked questions that were merely sparked by one man or woman's curiosity. What if light could be contained in a bottle? In what way would it be possible for man to soar with the birds? Or how could we most easily exchange information over vast distances? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch questions have beckoned the light bulb, the airplane, and of course the internet. Social questions beckon similar results. Why do certain people vote for certain political groups? Why is it that babies that aren't coddled or soothed when they cry grow up to be more independent? Why is it that family members despite being just as much a part of society as everyone else are off limits in romantic pursuits? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answers to which are complicated but still there, say for the last question. It's just programmed into society that such pursuits are deemed wrong. So wrong that many are sickened by thought. But why? In nature such relationships occur all the time and even humanity encourages it with endangered species and yet society discourages it when it happens in families. Yes there are the factors of genetic mutation but such genetic problems only occur through several generations of such activity not in the immediate first child. If animals are given the freedom to choose whichever mate they so want even if they are blood then why not people too? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts, these burning questions, haunted themselves in young Lisa Loud's mind. Never one for social ques, the pre-programed idea of 'incest is wrong' didn't stick in her head as it did with everyone else. The intrigue could not be fought and almost on instinct did she start writing out a hypothesis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would the results of such a relationship bring on not only the couple but the people in their lives? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was a speed bump in this little expirement of hers, a major one. For this to work she'd have to find family members very close to each other, more so than the typical family bond. More so this study would take years to properly do so the subjects couldn't be parent and child, they would have to be siblings. But the only family in royal woods that fit those characteristics was be her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she paused... her family was no stranger to her expirements, much to their irritation, However it would take no study to see such activity that would shake her family. Not to mention the unknown effects and possible stress she would placing on Lincoln. As the sole male choice he had to be part of this expirement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere would be hardships, challenges that she would willingly have brought on him and the sister she would choose for him to be with. At this pause she wondered... could she stand through her own guilt for this study? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh she found her answer, for the sake of science she needed to know and began to write down the rough outline of her experiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow facing another obstacle, which sister would she pursue to be with Lincoln? </span></div></div>",

Given her expierence in dating and releationships there was no doubt that if she was infatuated with Lincoln she would stay loyal to him. Add on the fact of how strict and authoritive she is as just opposed to Lincoln\u2019s more care free nature they would seem as great compliments to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then there would be variables in this. Bobby. Although there was no doubt in Lisa\u2019s mind, as cynical as it was, that this high school romance wouldn\u2019t last the matter of when it would expire was up to debate. And given Lori\u2019s level of infatuation with the boy it didn\u2019t seem likely to occur within a reasonable time frame. However Lisa was impatient and she could admit she was. Waiting may be the best option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could stir feelings in them as she waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she could really push for them to be together, man make situations that would drive Lincoln and Lori closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr god forbid... what if she used a little medicinal help to move things along? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t against the last one but she did have her reservations on it. How would she proceed? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And thus it was decided, with Lisa's eyes now narrowing on a suspicious purple vile. Taking it in hand she gave it a swish, bubbles floating from the bottom to the top with the aroma of fresh paper mixed with the gentle scent of a bunsen burner warming up. At least that's what it smelled like to her... Pulling at one of the desk drawers she scanned the contents, mostly petri dishes. Producing two with hair samples she opened both and carefully added a strand from each into the vile, the hair dissolving into it. Months of collecting her family's genetic material and not once did it cross her mind to use them as test subjects for this \"love potion\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids dinner!\" her father called from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nom noms!\" Lily proclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes younger sibling, it is indeed time for nom noms.\" she said retrieving her sister from her crib, holding the vile in hand as she hurried down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting Lily in her high chair Lisa approached her father and asked if she could set the tableware out. While it seemed odd to him that Lisa of all his daughters would be asking this he couldn't say no to extra help and handed her all the plates and silverware to set out. The chore was a bit difficult given her disadvantage in the height department. However it gave her the opportune chance to lather Lincoln and Lori's plates in the purple concoction. Luckily said plates were of a darker color so it wouldn't draw too much suspicion. As her siblings hurried in to take their places for Dad's good old culinary masterpiece of franks and beans, Lisa sat back and watched the start of her experiment commence from the kids table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the first bite Lincoln chowing down hard, going in for seconds in no time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you at least try to show some manners?\" Lola complained.finding that having another pig at the table ontop of Lana was too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry this just tastes really good today!\" Lincoln said with his mouth full, grossing Lola out further.but making Lana laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tastes the same to me.\" Lucy added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah dad had to have added something else in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sweetie it's just the normal recipe\" Lynn sr. answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You sure you didn't put like a special salt or something in this?\" Lori questioned receiving the same answer from her dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frankly Lori its always bean this good!\" Luan joked with a laugh getting one out of her dad as well. Bad joke aside, that couldn't be the case. This really tasted different than usual, it was actually good! Good enough for a second helping maybe a third...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was a mistake, or to Lisa all according to plan. Twin groans escaped from both tables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lori, sweetie you okay?\" her mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah Lincoln, you look greener than hops!\" Lana said grossing Lola out even more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Lincoln looks sick!\" she proclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll according to plan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh your burning up Lori.\" their mother said, a second later Lori looked as if she was going to puke. \"Oh no no no!\" luckly she was able to swallow it back, getting several disgusted looks. \"Get her a bucket guys.\" their mom said aloud. She hurried over to Lincoln who looked just as bad as Lori did. \"oh my gosh sweetie, here let me help you up.\" she said carfully hoisting him into her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must of been the food.\" Lisa said, best to cover her tracks then have anyone look into what was going on. As unlikely as it would be that they'd find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lincoln did say it tasted funny.\" Lana pointed out. Lori must've heaved back 2 more loads in the past couple minutes. Their father hurried to his daughter's side, helping her up from her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right kids throw away all the food while me and your mom get them to their beds.\" he said, the rest of his kids starting to do as he said. As he said, Lori and Lincoln were taken to bed  by their parents. Now stewing in a mix of headaches and stomach cramps, their parents tried to comfort them in whatever way they could. They still suffered but at least the ice packs they got were taking their minds off the pain for a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita already made the decision to keep them home from school the next day, just to be safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then the concoction should stir the attraction that Lisa was looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day...</span></div></div>",

Which wasn't hard to contemplate in Lisa's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle knock came at Leni's door, startling her from her desk. \"What was that!?\" Leni asked half scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me Leni.\" Lisa responded, Leni giving a gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh M gosh Lisa did you turn yourself invisible?\" Leni asked. Lisa let out a slight frustrated sigh, how Leni made it this far in life may require its own study one day but that was beside the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No i'm outside your door, can i come in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Leni let out in relazation \"Come on in then!\" she gleefully said. Lisa entered the room, holding some peculiar magazines as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mail just arrived and these came for you,\" Lisa said laying the magazines at Leni's desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw thank you Lisa, but you didn't have to turn yourself invisible just to do that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Lisa said unamused. \"Have fun with your fashion literature.\" she said leaving at that. Hopeful that her plan would spark interest in Lincoln's obsession with comics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni gleefully picked up her mail, sifting through it as looked at the covers. These magazines seemed strange to her, some of them looked like full body suits were in this season while others showed off a masquerade type thing going on. This didn't look like her normal fashion mags, the publisher was way different too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mar-vel\" Leni said out loud phonetically. The designs were weird but she did like some of them.

Leni wasn't the brightest bulb but Lincoln certainly wasn't a fool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, there was also the issues of long term research that bothered her. The human mind was a fickle thing and as the multiple times Lori and Bobby 'broke up' and 'rekindled' themselves showed, it couldn't be trusted to even keep it sensible.

One breath of this stuff and whoever would breath it in would gain romantic feelings for the first living thing they saw.

In order to have absolutely no chance of anyone or anything getting in the way or contaminating her data any further, she would have to gas the two while they were in an enclosed space, i.e. thier rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Linky, can I talk to you?\" Although her door wasn't open, Lisa could easily recognize the voice of her 2nd oldest sister.

And I'm not saying that in sarcasm.\" The door to Lincoln's room opened up and Leni walked through with it closing behind her. Lisa quickly looked to the clock. She had a five minute window as each of the other girls would be still practicing thier individual hobbies, more then enough time to wheel the gas canister over. Never one to take the chance though, Lisa rushed across the hall as fast and quietly as she could, her eyes constantly watching for any opening doors.

There was no way they could tell the colorless gas was slowly creeping towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln just sat there on his bed as Leni stood beside him. Leni had come in to say hi, but Lincoln still sat there expecting there to be more his second oldest sister wanted. Finally, after a minute or so of sitting in anticipation, Lincoln sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Leni? Was there anything else you wanted to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni held her hands behind her back, the near invisible gas slowly encroaching on her. \"Not really. I just wanted to say hi to my favorite brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln rolled his eyes, though he did his best to hide any other form of annoyance. If this was Luan then he'd take this as a setup for an obvious joke. This was Leni though, so she didn't know better most times. \"Leni, I'm your only brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the more reason for me to give you special treatment.\" Leni couldn't quite put her finger on it, but something in the room felt different. She had been in Lincoln's room before, mostly when she wandered in by accident. But something in the room was different, something was giving it a really sweet smell. The kind of smell that just gave Leni that tingling feeling in her chest. By now, the cloud of gas had fully coated Leni, so even if she could put 2 and 2 together she wouldn't be able to escape the beautiful smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln eyed his sister with a raised eyebrow, she seemed a little...what was the word? She seemed a little more...light than usual. Her eyelids were fluttering and she was mouth breathing as she put a hand on her chest. Lincoln stepped off the bed, right into the cloud of gas. The boy coughed, his lungs filled with the strong smell. \"Dang it Leni, she you get into Lola's perfume box again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni stared at her brother, a smile slowly stiching it's way across her face. \"Aww Lincoln. It's so sweet how you care.\" The scent of strawberries only got stronger as she kept her eyes on Lincoln. He was just so cute, not just cute in the younger brother sense but something else was growing in Lori. That white hair, his orange shirt he wore everyday. In fact,everyone in the house wore the same style of clothes. Lincoln's was definitely cuter though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln could feel a hand floof his hair, he would be lying if he said he didn't enjoy it. Ever sense he was a toddler, he always did like the way Leni stroked him. Now though, he could feel his heart beating. A strange mix between after a workout with Lynn and after a day out with Ronnie Ann. Lincoln looked into Leni's eyes, and his heart just kept beating towards the second option. In fact, it felt like it was going faster. His knees felt weak as he held out his hand. Leni put her hand to his own, the two locking together as the two stood there. Neither wanted to look away, they just stood there breathing in the gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa turned off the gas, rushing away to her room before anyone saw her. Though certainly not the most athletic of her family, she had enough endurance to run there and back. The two hadn't moved from thier spot. Oh how she wished she had finished up those upgrades to her mind reader. To think just how quickly the thoughts of those two were changing, being melded by her creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linky...I...I have something to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy coughed, though it was clear it was faked. \"Really? What a coincidence. So do I. I mean...I don't think it's the same as yours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeni leaned in close to Lincoln, her grip on his hand only matched by his own. \"You know what would be totes cool? If we said what we wanted at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln nodded, both taking a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leni...<br>\r\n\"Lincoln...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...I love you!\" The two hardly finished before they fully embraced each other in a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lack of reaction from any of the others rooms signified none of the others heard that little confession. At least that was what it seemed like to Lisa. But the important thing was the gas worked. A pretty significant feat with how Lisa pretty much eyeballed the recipe. Hopefully it wouldn't have much of a side effect. Either way, brother and sister were now in love, now the research could begin.</span></div></div>",

A few quiet sighs came from the doors, no doubt the siblings trying to pull themselves away from thier favorite hobbies. As the myriad of doors began to open, Lisa leaned up against the wall to create the illusion she was listening to one of her rap songs. Even with the noise of the sisters as they headed down, Lisa still kept an ear to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, see you at the dinner table Linky.\" Leni said with a dejected sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLincoln gave a small chuckle. \"Leni, we can walk to the table. We don't have to seperate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're right. You are just so smart Lincoln.\" Out of the corner of her eye, Lisa could see Leni giving Lincoln another hug. \"And I can't wait to tell the others. They will be totes surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, going to let it all out right from the start? A bold choice no doubt, possibly a result of the sudden introduction to this affair. What caught Lisa's ear however was the gasp Lincoln gave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Leni, we can't just flat out tell them. Especially not all at once like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn annoyed signal from Lori telling Lisa to get down the stairs took the kid's attention for a moment. She had to nod and act like she was going to put her music away. Once Lori was out of sight, Lisa rushed back to the door to the loud of a slightly distraught Leni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you love me Linky? Shouldn't we tell them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leni, of course I love you. But...\" Even if only listening, Lisa could tell Lincoln was straining to find the right words. \"They wouldn't understand. None of them would. At best, they'd think it was a joke Luan put us up to and at worst...I can't even imagine the test Lisa would do to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding in a giggle from the irony, Lisa couldn't believe this. It seems even with the drug's breakdown of the personal tabuu, at least Lincoln was still aware of the social perception of thier relationship. Or maybe Leni wasn't fully aware to begin with. Either way, the genuine concern in Lincoln's voice was a great mental note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Lincoln, I'm sure our family will find out sooner or later. You know how terrible I am at keeping secrets. I still think we should tell them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lincoln! Leni! Lisa! You better get down here before Lynn and I eat your portions.\" Lana's call brought all three back to reality. Lisa knew she had to get down there especially. With the family's knowledge of her experiments, they'd question the reason her absence quite quickly. As she headed towards the stairs, she could hear the tail end of Lincoln's voice.</span></div></div>",

Her interest in music and application to knowing how to set up all the equipment certainly had a promising future, so long as she didn't overly aim for the stars. Lisa was only looking at it realistic, hope for the best but make sure you can live your life. Even with the grants and notoriety that she received, Lisa was comfortable with just being a science teacher if it really came down to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she digressed, back to the experiment. This choice would include a additional obstacle that would not be present in any of her other sisters, Luna's sexual orientation. No one would out right ask her if she was gay, but her interest in her friend Sam was very apparent. If she wasn't gay she was at least bi. While this factor is apparent, Lisa thought of it as another opportunity. The results from this would yield  more social research on the effects on sexual confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes this option did peak her interest... not how to go about it....</span></div></div>",

How she hadn't put someone in the hospital was beyond her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with an eagerness to make people happy that may translate well into a relationship, possibly a loyalty. Poor Lincoln though, the pranks he may have to go through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again if Luan's attention is on Lincoln then she won't bother everyone else.

She wants to study the effects of a incestuous relationship has not only on the couple in question but the world around them. Using Lincoln as the control subject with her and her sisters as the variables in the equation she will see just how the world accepts or rejects such a pairing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n-this is primarily a romance story, i'm okay with intimacy however if the story veers too much off and devolves into smut i will take action and delete chapters if needed. <br>\r\n-since this will involve multiverse theory, ie meaning that there will be branching pathways that lead to various outcomes, i will tolerate some one word chapters. <b>HOWEVER</b> such chapters are only tolerated if the next chapter that proceeds it is at least a paragraph in length. Meaning it has to expand on the choice that was addressed not just be another choice of how something will proceed. In short, if there are multiple one word chapters happening right next to each other they will be deleted and i will edit them into something i see fits more with this story in mind. <br>\r\n-only relationships with Lincoln's sisters permitted, goes without saying but i do know people like ronniecoln and i myself have a weakspot for samcoln. however the focus of this story is on lincoln and his sisters.<br>\r\n-<b>ONE GIRL PER TIMELINE</b> can not stress this enough, this isn't a harem story! this is a romance story and Lincoln will only be infatuated with one of his sisters per the timeline that is set up. There will be multiple scenarios set up in which to experiment with each girl so there will be options to proceed with everyone. <br>\r\n-As for time jumps, given the ages of some of the charecters, i will provide options in choosing the girls that have aged up versions but in terms of when the story is proceeding i will not mind them so long as you dont go crazy and jump a decade or something between a chapter. <br>\r\n-Storylines may end should you think up a fine way to end them, however this is also something that i will judge on my own for if i think a story line still has potential then i will reopen it. Though i will ask the author who wrote the ending if it is okay before hand. <br>\r\n-<b>FINALLY</b> please have all the fun in the world with this, get creative, be silly, funny, or anything that you find you can add to this little project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Timlines</div><br>\r\nFor each girl there will be three options<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-a waiting timeline, in which Lisa takes things slow and gently nudges them into being interested with each other. Such timelines are for the purposes of aging up the characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-a immediate timeline, in which Lisa is more aggressive with getting results in the now rather than the later. These timelines keep the characters in their show respective ages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-the drug option, similar to the immediate timeline however in this timeline Lisa will second guess some of her results due to her introducing a drug she developed to stir romantic feelings in Lincoln and whomever she chooses to be with him. These timelines while similar to the immediate aren't identical. The drug is untested may lead to side effects, like mood swings and such. <b>THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO MAGICALLY MAKE THEM SUPER HORNY OR TO RANDOMLY MAKE THEM GROW GIANT TITS.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">With that out of the way...<br>\r\nlet the experiment begin.</div></td>",
