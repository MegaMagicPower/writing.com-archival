White streaks flared outward in a brilliant explosion that breached the reaches of all vision, and within its center life stirred. It could not be seen, save for the slightest ripple of energy that shook this universe, but its eyes could be sensed, the watcher's gaze gripping the listener's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it spoke...</span></div></div>",

It's funny how history has repeat itself. Discover a new species of living organisms similar to the dominant species, first order of business is to <b>ENSLAVE THEM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this time around, the government has set a few rules that try to maintain the life cycle of each and every species of slaves they could find.For one, you need a registered slave owning license, which you have in your pocket, packed nice and firmly.After that, you can own your very own slave, through auctions or through pet-like stores, or you can even adopt one if you wish. If you do own a slave, you must have him or her on a leash when you travel, or else they could be considered astray, and can be legally taken away from you.Lastly, you can do anything with your slave! Feed them, pet them, put them to labor, or even have sex with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You really hope it's the last one.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, you are indeed a 22 year old man, who's been feeling quite lonesome after leaving the house, and being on your own, in a apartment.You're not exactly the most brute person out there, but you certainly have more brains than brawn. Hell, you finished high school being in one of the top 5 students in the county! Top that, Einstein!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's why you are excited! Today, at a local library, they are holding a auction. This auction has proclaimed that this is <i>unlike any other.</i>You're pretty sure that was an attention grabber, but who cares when you can own a furry for 3 dollars?Seriously, someone has offered 3 dollars for a ant anthropomorphic being, and that person won!You hope your luck is as high as ever, as you want to be able to get the lowest price for anybody, or anything really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a decent walk down to the local library, you instantly see signs that show where the auctions are being held, which is commonly pointing to the left. After following the signs, there was a door with a label saying \"Auctions being held! Please keep quiet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ironic ain't it?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered the door to see a crowd of people all who are sitting in chairs, possibly all bidders, but some are more than likely to just watch. You head towards the crowd, but then you right foot hit a small basket with signs, each labeled with numbers.Your hit was loud enough to have a few people turn back at you then back to the auctioneer. You felt slightly embarrassed. You quickly grabbed a random sign, ironically numbered 69, and head into a random chair,in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And sold to the beautiful lady in the white dress!\" A voice said, most likely the auctioneer. A few round of claps before the antelope anthro was carried off by a leash. You didn't know who exactly was holding the leash, but that didn't matter to you. Right now, the only thing that matters is you getting someone to take home with you, and possibly getting physically intimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next on the list is a special little bugger. Will my associates please bring it up!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEr...What exactly was it?</span></div></div>",

You can clearly see her breasts, which has the same gray-colored, scruffy fur, that is all over her body. Her fur covered everything, her arms, her legs, her face, her boobs, her butt, her...womanly part. She also has one eye, and it was big, and there was a mouth under it.Your, not sure if there are any bones inside of it,but one thing for sure was her ass! Holy cow, from where you are sitting it looks like it sticks out a least a foot from her...3 foot body!?How can something that small manage to carry that thing without falling over? Another thing you noticed was that her arms and legs...were just arms and legs.No fingers, no toes, no hands, or no feet. It made her look cuter that way somehow. Also, she has swirly orange and yellow horns on the upper corners of her head.They look like in a form of a poop, which is very NOT normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...today we have a special breed! We...don't know where she exactly came from, other than the fact that she probably came from a distant island.She...er, has currently been through 6 different owners...all of which returned her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe auctioneer sounds no where close to professional, in fact he's reading some pieces of paper he has in his hands. But that didn't concern you, and what did was this strange...Sasquatch...fuzzball...hairball...woman creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's seems to be trembling in her cage, and her eye is quickly darting around the room. She's sitting down, with both arms over her chest, as if she's saying 'Please don't kill me!' For some reason, even though you know you are suppose to be sad for her, it's actually...kinda cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then and there, that her innocent and oblivious cuteness, that made you make the question of your future social life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>How much is she!?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The starting bid is a 10 dollars! Anyone's game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>BINGO</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly wave your sign saying \"Yoo hoo! Over here!\" The man quickly notices your sign, and chuckles a bit. Now, don't think you didn't know what he was chuckling about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyoo! We got 10 dollars...\" Suddenly, the man word-per-minute went from normal, to godspeed! Holy moly, you couldn't keep up what he was saying. However, you did notice that fact that the crowd was not challenging you for raising the price on her. It's possibly because many people do not see her as a women who is ready for sex, as most of the crowd were male...Or possibly because of that one rumor where a man got his wiener ripped off by accident by an anthro with horns. After a good 50 second babble from the auctioneer, your ears started to pick up what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going once...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, is this real!? I-Is everyone in this room serious right now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going twice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my god, this is real....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going triple...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>STOP F***ING AROUND AND SAY IT, DAMN YOU!</b> Sorry, you couldn't contain your brain from saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And sold to the gorgeous man in the back!\" The auctioneer said, pointing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo-hoo!\" You were so excited that you couldn't contain yourself from standing up from your seat while shouting that. You couldn't help it, your a very excitable person, like that time when you got an A in English class. You got a few laughs from the crowd, felling slightly embarrassed, yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't really matter, you got a new buddy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Self high-five*</i><br>\r\n******Sometime Later******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying for the new slave that you got, a crew of 2 people helped you bring the cage outside, and put a tarp over it.You know, so the wind doesn't get in her big eye. You can't really tell, but when you were carrying that thing, you felt the whole thing shaking, obviously sending signals that she's scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile giving a small chat to the crew, one of them hands you a stack of papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is everything you need to now about this chick.Use it wisely, my friend.\" He said, sounding humble, possibly for a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you know what I mean.\"The other persons said, making a gesture with his hand, close to his little Jackson. After a good laugh, the crew walks off, leaving you with your new slave.As for the informational papers, you decide to read them later, right now you want to keep home, all of this excitement if building up so much, you feel like you may explode from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever...you could relieve this excitement with a few 'special' places...</span></div></div>",

As of right now, you head home with your new cage in hand. Man, a free cage and a low costing slave? You must be one lucky man right now! Or at least you think you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the walk, you quickly state \"Get ready for a big surprise!\" to your slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time walking, you have soon come to your own home's front door. You decide to greet her properly, by showing her how your house looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait, wait! You mean apartment!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to take a few steps back, trying to make sure she can see what you want her to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you ready for your surprise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. You alive in there?\" You ask, hoping she can detect that worry in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no response...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping she didn't die on the spot, you remove the tarp from on top of the cage. Well...she's alive, you can see that, but she's playing dead...in a cute way. She has her ass stuck out in the air, which is big enough to press against the top of the cage, forming it into tiny squares of fur.She is trying to cover her head, and has her eye tightly closed, along with a frown on her face. All of it add up to just one big pile of fluffy cuteness! But now's not the time to be going <i>Aww...</i>Now's the time to get her comfortable, and show her how rude you aren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know yourself pretty well, and you don't want her to suffer through what her previous owners did. Most possibly rape, torture, and possibly other things you don't want to talk about. That's probably why she's trying to protect herself, she thinks the surprise was a surprise butt sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,hello?\" You say. The slave opened her eyes, blinked twice, then looked up to you, still keeping that frown and the sorrowful look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...What do you think?\" You point towards your home, which she follows your finger towards you home. She blinks twice again, and then proceeds to shut her eye again, this time she was shivering, and this time it was shaking the cage, as her butt was touching the top of the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You did take a moment to stare at, and confirmed it was quite big for her size. Plus, it looked big enough to bury your entire hand in it, and very thought of it did make a wee bit horny.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n****After showing the home****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set the cage down next to your current dorm door. After reaching to your pocket and pulling a key to unlock to door, you open the door and looked inside, making sure nothing is there to surprise you or the slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...It looks pretty normal. All of the walls are painted a light-brown color, except for the ones in the bathroom and the kitchen, which is located to the left and to the right, respectively. Looking straight ahead is the living room, accompanied by a bay window, with a pretty spectacular view of the outside garden, that was filled with roses, that is run by the people of the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour slave is darting her eye around the room, in a motion as if she is looking for traps from the ceiling and on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What did those people do to her!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my world.\" You say. She didn't respond, instead she is still looking for traps. You drag the cage across the floor into the living room, soon hoping you will think more carefully with your choices. There are skid marks all across the floor, thanks to you. You ignored the marks, for now, and turned your attention to your slave, and she did the same to you...still looking for traps with one eye...somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" You started, trying to sound non-threatening.\"This is my home and this is your home, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to understand, but she is not letting go of that gaze of hers. It looks like she is terrified, and her stance looks similar to a dog stretching backwards, which is both cute, and signaling how much she is under stress...or something like that. You paused to think for a moment.How are you going to earn her trust to come out of her cage? Also, who and why on earth would torture someone as innocent as her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thinking, and awkward stares from you towards her, you decided that one best way to show you mean no harm, is to physically show no harm.And what better way to do it than with a great big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crouch down to be at an even height with her, opened the cage, and sat back a few steps away from the cage. You then held out your arms towards her, hoping she understand what you want to do to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even a full 5 seconds has passed, and she has her back against the cage. She's also trying to scoot as far back as possible by pushing with her stubby legs. She even has her arms out, as if she has gotten cornered in a cat and mouse situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa! I didn't mean to scare you like that!\"You say. You were surprised how fast she can move, it was almost in a blink of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only trying to give a hug.See?\" You waft your hands towards you, again hoping she understand you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking both to her left, and to her right, then looking back to you with her one eye ball and worried frown, she...</span></div></div>",

She appeared to be some kind of cat, with fur that -- though once beautifully, vibrantly grey -- was now dirty and mangy from neglect. She kneeled there, staring at the floor in front of her, trying desperately to avoid eye contact with the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were attending, somewhere on the fringes of society, an underground auction where a shady organization comes to pawn off various dubiously-gained goods. The details weren\u2019t really important. You only cared about the whole business because you could occasionally nab valuable baubles at half the normal price. But over the years, these auctions have been rapidly declining in quality. Most annoying was the occasional sale of \u2018anthros\u2019. Anthros are bizarre, artificially created hybrids of humans and animals that started popping up a few years ago. While nobody knew what to do with them at first, when the courts ruled that anthros weren\u2019t protected by human rights, they started garnering interest as exotic pets, servants, and even -- you shudder to think -- \u2018toys\u2019. You personally found the trade of anthros to be distasteful, at best, and you certainly had no interest in buying one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThe bidding will start at seventy-five hundred dollars! The seller won\u2019t take anything less than seventy-five hundred dollars,\u201d</span> The auctioneer announces. Though she was apparently extremely cheap for an anthro, you still weren\u2019t at all interested. You resolved to just ignore her altogether, and wait for the next item to be brought up. Though as you sat there, you noticed something strange about the feline. While most anthros that were sold at this auction seemed enthusiastic and excited to be sold, she looked miserable, as if she was on the verge of tears. Though you usually didn\u2019t like anthros, you couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for the poor feline. You felt nauseous when it struck you how much she reminded you of Mary -- a cat you grew up with as a child. But you couldn\u2019t let nostalgia cloud your judgement. You weren\u2019t prepared to own an anthro. Where would you even keep her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOh, wait! I have a note here from the seller...\u201d</span> the auctioneer pauses, obviously having not prepared at all beforehand. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAh, it looks like this beauty is a limited-time offer! If she isn\u2019t sold today, she\u2019ll be put down, so buy her fast!\u201d</span> Though she was turned away from you, you noticed the feline visibly shudder as he spoke that line. You reacted too, your fingers clenching around the arms of your chair in surprise. What the hell? Since she was a pet, legally, she could be \u2018put down\u2019, but\u2026 they wouldn\u2019t, would they? As far as you were aware, anthros were sapient, and maybe even as intelligent as humans. Now you understood why the poor girl looked so miserable. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSeventy-five hundred dollars. I want seventy-five hundred dollars...\u201d</span> You held your breath as the auctioneer called for bids among the completely silent crowd. Most preferred enthusiastic and submissive anthros; nobody wanted to buy an anthro that looked so miserable. You silently prayed that someone would buy her. You had no interest in purchasing her yourself, but\u2026 you couldn\u2019t just let her die, right? Everyone else seemed completely apathetic to the feline\u2019s fate. After a while, the auctioneer paused, seeming on the verge of giving up. This may be your last chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\u201cI\u2019ll consider this my good deed for this month,\u201d</b></i> you mutter quietly to yourself, before holding up a finger, calling the auctioneer\u2019s attention. <b>\u201cFuck it! Seventy-five hundred dollars!\u201d</b> You declare on impulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSold for seventy-five hundred dollars!\u201d</span> The auctioneer\u2019s face lit up, as he didn\u2019t even bother trying to fish for bids any longer. You lean back in your chair as the feline is dragged offstage. What have you gotten yourself into? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat there and despaired, the auction continued. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAnd our next item is...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the auction, you stopped to pay for and retrieve the things you bid for. You did manage to nab a few small trinkets, but ultimately, you blew most of your money on the anthro. <b>\u201cHey, about that anthro...\u201d</b> you stop to ask. <b>\u201cI know I bought her and all, but is there any chance I could just let her go? Let her run off and be free? I don\u2019t really want to keep her.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cIt\u2019s possible, I suppose. But legally, anthros are considered pets, and cannot be left to roam the streets unattended,\u201d</span> is the only answer you receive. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cSorry, sir.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAlright...\u201d</b> You sigh. <b>\u201cBring her up.\u201d</b> The young anthro is presented before you, which let you finally see her in closer detail. This was one of the first few times you had seen an anthro this close before, in fact. You were struck by how much she resembled a normal human, with only a few nagging differences. She looked very surreal, almost as if you were staring into the uncanny valley. Being completely naked and having been obviously genetically engineered to have a physique more befitting a supermodel or a porn star than a maid, it was obvious she had been created with one \u2018purpose\u2019 in mind. However, you personally had no interest in that kind of thing, and honestly found it kind of disgusting. Additionally, you noticed a few scars along her back and sides, and other general signs of neglect and abuse. Apparently this feline had had a rough lot in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, she stared at the ground, completely silent, trying not to make eye contact. You had expected her to be excited and grateful -- you had just saved her life, after all -- but instead, she looked almost\u2026 disappointed. Since this was your first anthro, you were briefed on the basics of anthro care. They also offered you a leash to lead her around with, but you declined. Had to let the poor girl keep <i>some</i> dignity. Instead, when you were all finished, you let her walk out by your side, leaning her head on your shoulder weakly. You hurried back to your car as fast as you could, definitely not wanting to be seen in public with a naked anthro chick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you started on the long drive home, you let her lay down in the backseat, mostly because she looks like she hadn\u2019t rested in days. She still hadn\u2019t said anything, and was facing the other direction from you. She probably assumed you were some kind of pervert. After about a half hour, you decide to break the silence. <b>\u201cSo\u2026 you\u2019ve got a name, right?\u201d</b> You say, expecting some kind of response,  but she just remained silence. After a few minutes, you reached back and tried to get her attention. <b>\u201cEh?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cYou should\u2019ve just left me there...\u201d</span> was the first thing she said, sounding like she was on the verge of tears. You grimaced. Oh boy. This might turn out to be even harder than you expected. She does know they would\u2019ve killed her if you hadn\u2019t bought her, right? Maybe she didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah, maybe I should\u2019ve. But I didn\u2019t,\u201d</b> you say, a bit more assertively. <b>\u201cSo I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re gonna have to put up with me. And it would help if you told me your name.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was silent for a while. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI don\u2019t have a name,\u201d</span> she answered simply, as if it was completely normal. You recall reading online that many anthros that were created to be slaves weren\u2019t given names, to further deter any sense of individuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell, that\u2019s just inconvenient. I have to call you something,\u201d</b> you say. <b>\u201cIf you could have any name you wanted, what would it be?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just looks confused and frustrated for a few minutes, like she wasn\u2019t really interested in the question, before suddenly having a change of heart as inspiration strikes. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMary,\u201d</span> she says. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI think I\u2019d want to be called\u2026 Mary.\u201d</span> Your heart leaps, and your grip on the steering wheel tightens. Mary\u2026 as you mentioned before, that had been the name of your beloved childhood pet. Did she know? After pondering this for a while, you decide it must be just a coincidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cMary\u2019s a fine name,\u201d</b> you finally reply. You couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say, and she seemed like the quiet type anyway, so you spent the next couple hours in silence.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually, you arrive at your humble two-story apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull open the car door, only to find that mary was sound asleep, and had been for most of the drive. It made sense, you suppose; she didn\u2019t look like she gets much rest. You try shaking her awake, but realize she\u2019s a remarkably deep sleeper. You also realize how incredibly light she was; probably because feline anthros are created with agility and climbing ability prioritized, similarly to real cats. Ultimately, you shrugged and decided to just let her sleep, instead picking her furry body up in your arms and carrying her inside. This earned you a few funny looks from your neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plop her down on your couch, which still doesn\u2019t rouse her from her slumber. While you usually found anthros to be disturbing, you had to admit, she looked pretty cute lying there. You took a moment to consider what you were going to do with her in the long-term. You had already decided that you were going to try and give her away as soon as you find a good home for her, but in the meantime, you decided to set up the guest bedroom for her to stay in. By the time you finished, Mary was sitting up lazily on the couch, stretching and yawning. <b>\u201cRise and shine,\u201d</b> you greet. <b>\u201cWelcome to your new home, I guess.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMy\u2026 home?\u201d</span> she repeats. She seemed to be constantly confused by how you treat her. Judging from her scars, her previous owner must\u2019ve been a sick bastard, so she was probably used to being treated cruelly. She obviously didn\u2019t expect you to be very kind, and still didn\u2019t completely trust you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell, it\u2019s my apartment, so yeah,\u201d</b> you reply. You grimaced when you noticed some of the dirt and grime on her fur had stained the couch. <b>\u201cI\u2019d let you look around, but I think it\u2019d be best if you washed off first.\u201d</b> You walk off, gesturing for her to follow you. She pauses, distrusting, before reluctantly trailing after you. Even though she\u2019s fairly tall, you notice that she\u2019s so thin and lightweight that her footsteps were completely silent. You lead her upstairs to your largest bathroom, pointing towards your shower. In response, however, she only stares at you blankly, confused. <b>\u201c... you do know how a shower works, right?\u201d</b> She suddenly avoids eye contact, looking flustered and embarrassed. You sigh in frustration.  <b>\u201cNo? Really? How do you even bathe?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMy old master used to just hose me down every once in awhile...\u201d</span> Mary admits, the humiliation apparent in her voice. <i>Wow,</i> you think. <i>Getting her settled in is going to be harder than I thought... well, I guess that isn't her fault.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh\u2026 well, this is kind of like that,\u201d</b> you say, trying not to make her feel any more embarrassed than she was already. You fiddle around with the knobs for a moment, getting some warm water going. <b>\u201cJust go ahead and step in,\u201d</b> you direct. She hesitates, obviously terrified of the water, probably expecting it to be freezing cold. Her face immediately brightens, however, when she finally worked up the courage to step inside the shower, and felt the clear water flow over her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWow! The water\u2019s so warm,\u201d</span> she laughed, amazed. You realized that since she was used to being bathed via hose, she\u2019s probably never had a nice, warm, relaxing shower before. While you still weren\u2019t a big fan of anthros, it was admittedly rather heartwarming to watch her get so excited over something so simple. You heard there was a ton of bathing supplies made specifically for anthros, but you didn\u2019t have anything like that, so you figured normal soap would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was busy in the shower, you sat in the next room on your phone, looking for anthro shelters in the area. Eventually, you hear her messing with the knobs, followed by the sound of the shower shutting off. At least she learns quickly, you think to yourself. You walk in just as she was stepping out of the shower, tossing her a towel. While she dried off, you noticed she looked completely different while wet, her fur becoming shiny and slick, clinging to her skin. You noticed that her disposition had also changed; instead of being reserved and confused, she was starting to act a bit giddy and excited. While she dried off, you dug around for something for her to wear. You didn\u2019t want her walking around naked all the time, after all. Unfortunately, you didn\u2019t have anything close to her size. <b>\u201cHere, wear this,\u201d</b> you say, tossing her a t-shirt you decided on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly slips it on, looking eager to finally have some clothing. It was almost comically oversized, but at least it offered her some modesty, as well as making her look absolutely adorable. As you had come to expect, even the simple old, cheap, itchy t-shirt got her excited. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cThank you so much, master!\u201d</span> You cringe at the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cPlease. Call me Jim,\u201d</b> you insist, calmly. <b>\u201cNow, you want me to show you around? I\u2019ve got a spare bedroom downstairs.\u201d</b> You show her your guest bedroom, which you\u2019d been previously been using as nothing but a storage area. You watched as she plopped down on her new bed, inspecting it. The bed was a bit small and uncomfortable, but with her low standards, you really doubt she minded. You expected her to be beaming at this point, but when you turned to her, to your surprise, you noticed a few tears rolling down her face. <b>\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d</b> you raise a brow.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><br>\r\n\u201cN-no\u2026 it\u2019s just...\u201d</span> she says, wiping the tears from her face, as she tried to compose herself. Despite her crying, she can\u2019t seem to wipe the smile off her face as she leaned back in bed. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI always dreamed of living like this. Clothes, a room, a shower. I\u2026 I thought they were going to kill me first! I thought my whole life was just to be tortured and played with like some kind of\u2026 <i>toy</i>.\u201d</span> She cried, finally confiding in you. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cBut you\u2026 but you\u2019re\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down next to her on the bed, and let her rest her head on your shoulder as she cried. You shifted awkwardly, not sure what to say exactly. You were no therapist. <b>\u201cJesus, lady. It\u2019s nothing, really.\u201d</b> You sat in silence for a bit while she sobbed, as it dawned on her how glad she was to be alive. You didn\u2019t really care about her at first, but now, you couldn\u2019t help but sympathize with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she regained her composure, you stood up and left her to her own devices. <b>\u201cWell, you should get some rest. You need it,\u201d</b> you say. <b>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the living room if you need me.\u201d</b> With that said, you crash on the couch. It had been a long day, and you wanted to take a few moments to contemplate everything that\u2019s happened.</span></div></div>",

After looking so exhausted all day, you figured she would've wanted to get more rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI... I couldn't sleep,\u201d</span> she said, dismissively, but you could tell from the redness of her eyes that she probably had a pretty serious nightmare. It occurs to you that she was probably suffering some sort of PTSD from all that's happened to her. You were just planning on hitting the hay, but decide you should at least do something to make her feel better. You couldn\u2019t just leave her here to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThat's fine,\u201d</b> you reassure her. She stands awkwardly in your living room, looking distinctly out-of-place. <b>\u201cHey, you know what a \u2018movie\u2019 is, right?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWhat? Do you have movies!?\u201d</span> She instantly reacted, her eyes scanning the room before landing on the shelves around your TV. She rushed over, noticing the library of movies you keep on your shelf; everything you've ever considered worth keeping. She bent over to sort through your collection, which resulted in her inadvertently waving her big, furry rear in your face. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cOh my god! You have so many!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhoa, slow down. What's wrong?\u201d</b> you say as you stand up, startled by her outburst. She turned to you, that bright, giddy smile on her face again. After having watched her sob, it was a heartwarming sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI loved movies since I was a girl!\u201d</span> Mary explained, sorting through your collection. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cBut I pretty much never got to watch any... especially not this many.\u201d</span> You smiled, noticing that movies were apparently something Mary was particularly passionate about. Since she probably didn't have much experience with cinema, you grabbed a light adventure film you liked as a child, <i>Pirates of the Pancreas</i>. The feline's face lit up when you flicked the TV on. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cReally? We're... really going to watch one?\u201d</span> She says, almost in disbelief. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cOh, yes! Thank you!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you found movie previews annoying, Mary seemed absolutely enthralled by them. While they kept her entertained, you walked off to the kitchen to microwave some popcorn. When you returned, she was curl up cutely in a blanket on the couch, so enthralled in the trailers that she hadn't even noticed you left. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWhat's this?\u201d</span> she asked, only turning her attention away from the television screen when you handed her the bowl of popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIt's called 'popcorn'. Try it,\u201d</b> you recommend. She curiously tried a handful of popcorn, before smiling in approval and digging in for more. She now looked like a proper cinemaphile. You weren't entirely sure if popcorn was part of an anthro's recommended diet, but whatever, it couldn't hurt too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down on the other side of the couch just as the movie starts. Mary's eyes opened wide with wonder as scenes of grand adventure, likeable characters and exciting action flashed onscreen. You could see why she was such a big fan. When life becomes too mundane \u2013 or, in her case, too unbearable \u2013 it's always nice to escape into fiction. Though you were a little worried she might assume everything she was seeing onscreen was real. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWhoa! How did he do that?\u201d</span> the feline gasped after a particularly impressive action scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cIt was probably just special effects,\u201d</b> you assured her. In response to her silence, you elaborated, <b>\u201cthe animators using computers to add something to a movie that isn't actually there. They can simulate pretty much every situation.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cSo they can make a movie about... anything?\u201d</span> she asks, her mind racing with the possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell, it could get expensive, but... pretty much, yeah,\u201d</b> you say with a shrug, but chuckle when you see the look on her face. <b>\u201cLet me guess. You want to work on movies someday?\u201d</b> She nods without taking her eyes off the screen. <b>\u201cWell, it's good to have dreams.\u201d</b> You noticed that she was absentmindedly leaning against your side while wrapped up in her blanket, absorbed in the film onscreen. She even rubbed her cheek against your side a bit, like a real cat would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found it a bit disturbing, to be honest. She was so similar to a human being -- the same voice, the same body, the same mannerisms \u2013 which only made the differences more noticeable. The fur that covered her body, her massive fluffy ears, her long tail... while she seemed cute and charming at a glance, when you really think about it, it was all just unnatural. Perturbed by the feeling of her furry cheek on your shoulder, you slide over to the other side of the couch. You couldn't tell for certain, but for a moment, her expression seemed a bit... hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the villain was defeated, the hero proposed to the damsel, and the movie faded to black. She jumped out of her seat as the credits rolled. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWhat? It's over already?\u201d</span> she gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWell, yeah. It's been over two hours,\u201d</b> you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cBut... but their story <i>can't</i> be over yet! They just saved the day and got engaged!\u201d</span> she insists. Her tail flicks around wildly behind her, signifying her displeasure. Apparently, she wasn't aware that movies had endings. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWhere do they go from there?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI don't know. I guess that's just left up to your imagination,\u201d</b> you shrug. It was a little charming seeing that she loved the storyline so much, especially since it wasn\u2019t even particularly good. <b>\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s probably a good time to hit the hay. It\u2019s going to be a long day tomorrow.\u201d</b> Your decision seems to snap the feline out of her trance, and she turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cOh, yeah. I guess it\u2019s pretty late, huh?\u201d</span> she laughs, looking at the clock. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cAgain, thank you so much. That movie was amazing! My old master never let me have any fun like this,\u201d</span> she says sincerely, as she shuffles lazily back towards her new room. After she left, you checked the clock yourself. 3 AM. Fuck. You made the long, arduous journey up the stairs, towards your ultimate destination; the master bedroom. By the time your tired body landed on your bed, you were already asleep.</span></div></div>",

Since you usually lived alone, your house was generally a complete mess, with bits of trash strewn about and various shelves left messy and unorganized. Stains were left to fester, and dust was allowed to build up. But this morning, everything looked absolutely spotless. All the surfaces in the house were thoroughly cleaned, and all your worldly possessions were organized neatly. In the middle of it all was Mary, still enthusiastically dusting cabinets while humming a jaunty little tune. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMornin\u2019, sleepyhead!\u201d</span> She briefly looked over her shoulder to greet you. Her demeanor was entirely different than it was yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh, wow. Did you do all this?\u201d</b> you said, looking around. You noticed all your movies had been rearranged on their shelf, and were now organized alphabetically. <b>\u201cEverything looks spotless.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWell, of course!\u201d</span> She says. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cThat is part of my duty as your servant, is it not?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c... I don't consider you a slave, you know. You don\u2019t have to do anything for me,\u201d</b> you frown. You liked a clean house, but you didn\u2019t want to feel like you were forcing her to do free labour for you. <b>\u201cIt\u2019d probably be better if you just relaxed.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cOh, no, I insist!\u201d</span> She says, turning to you. Her expression became a little more serious. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI mean\u2026 you saved my life, after all. And you\u2019ve treated me nicer than anyone else ever has\u2026\u201d</span> That was a sad thought, considering you weren\u2019t even a particularly nice guy. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cBesides, cleaning helps me take my mind off things.\u201d</span> You consider it for a while, then shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201c... suit yourself!\u201d</b> you decide, as you start preparing your routine morning coffee. If Mary really wanted to do some cleaning up around here, you certainly weren\u2019t going to stop her. While you relaxed, you browsed around on your phone -- but this time, you weren\u2019t looking for shelters, you were looking for therapists that specialize in helping troubled anthros. So far, you couldn\u2019t find any. You did, however, find a few who claimed to be experts at \u2018mentally breaking\u2019 anthros. Creepy fuckers. <b>\u201cOh yeah, by the way. If you\u2019re feeling up to it, we\u2019re going shopping later. Need to get you some grub, and hopefully a proper outfit,\u201d</b> you declare. <b>\u201cIf they even make clothing for anthros\u2026\u201d</b> The oversized t-shirt Mary wore was cute, but probably not too comfortable -- and because of her tail, she couldn\u2019t wear human pants, and you didn\u2019t want to be seen in public with her while she\u2019s half-naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cReally?\u201d</span> Mary replied, looking curious. She pondered in her head what, hypothetically, kind of clothing she would wear, if she could have anything. She had very little frame of reference, to be honest. \u2018Clothing\u2019 had long been a foreign concept to her; she had been walking around naked for as long as she could remember. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cCool,\u201d</span> she says, with that familiar hint of excitement in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only an hour later that you found yourself starting up your car. Mary sat in the passenger seat beside you, trying to figure out how to use a seatbelt. You took a quick glance at the beautiful skyline of Fresno as you messed with your phone, trying to deduce the best place to go clothes shopping for an mutant animal-human hybrid creature. You weren\u2019t surprised to find that there weren\u2019t many. Not finding any info, you just try embarking on the half-hour drive to the biggest mall in the area. Maybe they\u2019ll have something there. Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently there really was a clothing store that catered solely to anthros. When Mary laid eyes on it, she was like a kid in a candy store. You spent almost an hour talking with various employees, who helped her pick out underwear and outfits she liked. Of course, the whole shopping spree ran you a few hundred dollars, but it definitely turned out to be worth it. By the time she walked out of the store, proudly donning her new favorite outfit, she was absolutely beaming. For the first time in her life, she was fully dressed, and no longer had to walk around naked all the time. Even over something so minor, her whole demeanor changed; her strut seemed more confident and dignified, as if to send the message that she was an equal now, and not some lowly \u2018toy\u2019 anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cHow do I look?\u201d</span> She asks, striking a quick pose, showing off her vibrant red brouse that complemented her grey fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cFor the thousandth time: you look great,\u201d</b> you repeat. You couldn\u2019t help but be struck by how different she acts now compared to how she acted when you first laid eyes on her just yesterday. Maybe a little dignity and kindness was all she needed. She certainly still had a lot to learn about the world\u2026 but then again, so do you. Satisfied, the two of you walk off to grab something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cJiiiim! Hey buddy!\u201d</span> You suddenly hear a voice behind you. You turned to see a blond-haired man in a red tank top rapidly approaching. Mark. An old acquaintance of yours. You remember him as being kind of douchey, but rarely unbearable. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cShit, man, I haven\u2019t seen you in ages. Where you been?\u201d</span> While you had Mary in tow, you wanted to avoid being seen by anybody you knew, but it was already too late. Mark was only a few yards away now. Once he found out you had purchased an anthro, word was going to spread quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHey, Mark. I haven\u2019t been up to much, just, uh\u2026\u201d</b> you say, but are interrupted when Mary catches up to you and nuzzles against your side, not even having noticed that Mark was there. Upon realizing you owned her, the man immediately burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cHaha! You got one of those anthro fucktoys? <i>That\u2019s</i> what you\u2019ve been doing all this time? Wow\u2026\u201d</span> He said, almost in disbelief. You had earned yourself a reputation as a boring, average joe, so you could see why he would be surprised. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cAnd here I thought you were as vanilla as they come.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not -- what the hell? She\u2019s not my \u2018fucktoy\u2019!\u201d</b> you insist, his rashness taking you by surprise. <b>\u201cShe just cleans up around the apartment.\u201d</b> Mary, also a bit startled by his tone, grabbed on to your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares at the two of you incredulously for a few moments, sizing you up, before smirking. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cOh, I see what this is. You\u2019re one of those bleeding heart anthro fanatics, right? Shit. Guess I shoulda figured,\u201d</span> he said. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cYou think you\u2019re gonna \u2018fix\u2019 her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this,\u201d</b> you glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cHey, man, I\u2019m not being an asshole. I\u2019m just warning ya,\u201d</span> he explains. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cObviously, anthros are cute, right? You\u2019re probably falling in love with it. But listen -- it\u2019s an illusion, man.\u201d</span> He seems to drop his sarcastic demeanor, though that doesn\u2019t make you any less defensive. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cThey\u2019re programmed to be sympathetic, to convince guys like you to drop hundreds of dollars on \u2018anthro fashion\u2019 and \u2018anthro cuisine\u2019. Hell, how much did that outfit cost?\u201d</span> He asks, jabbing Mary in the chest with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d</b> you say, not wanting to listen to his ramblings anymore, grabbing Mary by the hand and leading her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\u201cSee? You can\u2019t even talk to your old pal anymore. Isolation -- that\u2019s the first step,\u201d</span> Mark insists as you walk off. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cShe\u2019s gonna bleed you dry!\u201d</span> You ignore him. You were already conflicted enough as it is; you don\u2019t need wild conspiracy theories like that clouding your judgment. Mary remained silent as the two of you disappeared around a corner, stepping into the bustling food court. You noticed that she seemed very tense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the two of you settled down at a table. You still had no idea what anthros were supposed to eat, but you figured, since she was a cat, she probably likes meat, right? You probably had to contact some sort of anthro dietitian at some point, especially since Mary still seemed fairly malnourished from her previous neglect. For the time being, at least, she seemed satisfied with steak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ate, you couldn\u2019t help but think about what Mark had said. You know it was probably bullshit, but\u2026 you remember how expensive Mary was, and how much money you\u2019ve already spent on \u2018deluxe, anthro-approved\u2019 products. Even the whole \u2018putting her down\u2019 thing seemed like it could\u2019ve been a ploy for your sympathy. Could Mary really be just some sort of parrot\u2026 designed to say whatever she needs to say to play with your emotions? <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWhat that man said, about me\u2026 none of it\u2019s true,\u201d</span> Mary whispers, almost as if she had read your mind. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cYou know that, right?\u201d</span>  You noticed her expression was dead serious, and her voice sounded worried.</span></div></div>",

I mean, it seems like an odd coincidence that Mary just so happened to choose the same name as your childhood cat had. You\u2019re probably just being ridiculous, of course\u2026 but there\u2019s no harm in being incredulous. <b>\u201cYou seem a bit defensive,\u201d</b> you say, noticing how pale and tense she became during Mark\u2019s ramblings. Just hearing your tone, Mary looked scared and hurt, like she knew you didn\u2019t fully believe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWhat? N-no, I\u2019m not...\u201d</span> The feline whispered, leaning in towards you. She seemed to choose her words carefully. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI just\u2026 I don\u2019t like it when people say things like that.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cWhat?

At this point, you almost didn\u2019t like calling her by the name \u2018Mary\u2019 anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMaster, we\u2019re having a great day. Right? All I want to do is sit back and enjoy our time togeth-\u201d</span> she insists, louder this time, trying to change the subject.

She leans closer, and hesitates for a few moments. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cA lot of people think anthros are\u2026 fake. Designed to manipulate people. It\u2019s a common\u2026 theory. Becoming more common every day. It\u2019s what my last master started to believe. That I was just an object\u2026 programmed to mess with his mind. That\u2019s why he\u2026 why he was planning to have me killed,\u201d</span>  she whispered, sounding dead serious. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cDo you understand now? I just don\u2019t want you to give up on me too.\u201d</span> She sighed, slumping back in her chair. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry, master. I don\u2019t like talking about this sort of thing.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the look in her eyes was all she needed to tug on your heartstrings. You decided to put a bit of trust in her for now -- but you still resolved to do more research later. <b>\u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019m sorry. Don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d</b> you relented, putting a reassuring hand on her shoulder. <b>\u201cBut stop calling me \u2018master\u2019.\u201d</b> Mary nodded with a smile, glad that line of questioning was over. From then, you only had a bit of small talk as the two of you finished your meal. The fast food wasn\u2019t particularly nutritious, of course, but it sated your appetites for the time being. As you ate, you couldn\u2019t help but notice that you were the only person with an anthro in the room, and Mary\u2019s presence had been earning you some funny looks. You couldn\u2019t help but feel a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mary seemed to bask in the attention she got. As you walked out of the mall, she couldn\u2019t help but wave and pose for curious passersby. As you travelled back to your car, the excitable feline in tow, you tried not to make eye contact with anyone, hoping not to be identified. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cSo where are we heading now?\u201d</span> Mary asks as she takes a seat, excited to explore more of the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI actually don\u2019t know,\u201d</b> you realize, as you pull out your phone. <b>\u201cHold on.\u201d</b> You browse around for any anthro-friendly establishments. There was an anthro grooming place nearby, and an anthro store, but mostly you found places that specialized in the torture and \u2018breaking\u2019 of slaves, which you had no interest in. Eventually, you discover <i>Fur Paradise</i>, which boasted its services in anthro care, supplies and medical care. It seemed like a pretty nice place, though it was an extra hour\u2019s drive away and seemed quite small. You ponder it for a while, before deciding <i>\u2018fuck it, might as well\u2019</i>. Perhaps you could even find the information you\u2019ve been looking for. As you start down the (slightly) long road north to Merced, you hand your phone to Mary. <b>\u201cHow does Fur Paradise look?\u201d</b> you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fiddles with your phone for a few moments, trying to figure out how it works, but she learns quickly. Her eyes light up as she looks over the details. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWhoa, this is where we\u2019re going? Yeah, this place looks great! Maybe I could even meet other anthros there,\u201d</span> she speculated with wonder. You relaxed as the bored feline continued to mess around with your phone, as you watched the grey cityscape roll by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n An hour later, as you finally drove into the parking lot, you noticed <i>Fur Paradise</i> did, indeed, look promising. There were a few red flags, of course. The doors and windows look a bit damaged, with one of the windows being smashed completely, and the store was obviously quite small. Shit, it looked like a riot just stormed through the area. Mary, of course, didn\u2019t notice any of these smaller details at all; she just rushed over and poked her head through the door, barely able to contain her excitement. On the inside, the store resembled a normal pet store, although selling more specialized food and medicine then toys. The only person you could see inside was a charming young lady, not much older than you, wearing a light purple outfit that vaguely approximated a uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bell chimed as you step inside, and the woman turned to you immediately, a smile on her face. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOh, good afternoon!\u201d</span> She says, seeing Mary walk in by your side. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI assume you\u2019re a new owner?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cLucky guess. Just bought her yesterday,\u201d</b> you nod, wrapping an arm around Mary's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAh, how exciting!\u201d</span> she smiles, inviting you in so the two of you can make introductions. Apparently, this woman was Sally, the one who ran this store, or so the website said. She looked a lot younger than you imagined. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAnd what\u2019s your name, sweetheart?\u201d</span> she asks, turning to your anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMary,\u201d</span> the feline answered with a timid smile, not used to Sally\u2019s outgoing nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThat is a beautiful name,\u201d</span> Sally smiles, ruffling Mary\u2019s hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cHey, uh,\u201d</span> Mary says, blushing a bit, <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cAre there any other, uh, anthr-\u201d</span> Suddenly, another uniformed person came rushing in from one of the side doors. You looked over, and laid your eyes on one of the most beautiful anthros you\u2019ve ever seen! She was apparently some kind of bird, and was obviously very well taken care of; her orange feathers were shiny and vivid, and her proportions healthy and full. You\u2019d never actually seen an avian anthro with such full wings; usually, their wings were clipped, so they couldn\u2019t fly away. If this is really what Sally\u2019s own anthro looked like, you and Mary were certainly in good hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cHey, Sally! I just got off the phone with John about the window. He-\u201d</span> the bird anthro said, in a loud, deep voice, before stopping when she laid eyes on the two of you. She looked almost surprised. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cOh, hey. We\u2019ve got some fresh faces.\u201d</span> The avian stopped for a moment with a sly smile, sizing you up. Mary gasped when she laid eyes on the bird. Before you could react, the feline had already burst forward, and wrapped the avian in a hug. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cWhoa!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cOh my god! I\u2019ve never seen another anthro up close before!\u201d</span> Mary beams, her timid demeanor having disappeared completely. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWe need to talk!\u201d</span> The avian gently pushes Mary away, startled by the outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cUh\u2026 what about?\u201d</span> she asks, visibly uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201c<i>Everything!</i>\u201d</span> Mary insists, before launching into a tirade of questions -- <i>where are you from? How did you get your feathers so shiny? Can you fly?</i> Et cetera. You and Sally laugh as you watch their conversation, with the bird desperately trying to keep up with Mary\u2019s energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cThat bird there. Is it yours?\u201d</b> you ask, deciding to make conversation while Mary was distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cRose? Yes, yes. Though I don\u2019t call myself her \u2018owner\u2019, I consider myself her equal. After all, for a happy anthro, all you have to do is afford them the same dignity you\u2019d give to any human being,\u201d</span> Sally smiles. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSo! Down to business. Do you have any training or experience in dealing with anthros, before Mary?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHell no,\u201d</b> you wave your hands. <b>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing: I don\u2019t actually really like anthros very much. Not a big fan. I just bought Mary because her previous owner was going to kill her if I didn\u2019t.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally cups a hand over her mouth. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cGoodness!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah. I'm still deciding if I'm even going to keep her,\u201d</b> you shrug. <b>\u201cBut in the meantime, I\u2019m going to need a ton of advice\u2026\u201d</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While your feline, Mary, excitedly chats with the avian, you and Sally discuss the issue at hand. Apparently raising a happy anthro was actually significantly less complicated than you always imagined it being. They\u2019re about as intelligent as humans, or so Sally claims, and thus don\u2019t require any training like a normal animal would. She also emphasized the importance of treating Mary as an equal, and not in the condescending manner most people treat their pets. You try to take her advice to heart. As for the feline\u2019s diet, well, it\u2019s about what you expected. Just like real cats, Mary was an obligate carnivore, and subsisted almost entirely on meat. Sally said that Mary looks a bit too skinny as a result of her previous owner\u2019s neglect, but reassured you that she would regain that weight in due time, given she eats well. <b>\u201cSo, what\u2019s with the window?\u201d</b> you say, changing the subject for a moment, pointing towards the shattered window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOh, please! Excuse the mess around here. We\u2019re working on it,\u201d</span> Sally laughed, uncomfortably. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYou know how it is. It\u2019s kind of tough running a business like this.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cHow so?\u201d</b> you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally stared at you blankly for a few moments, as if confused. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAre you\u2026 not aware of...?\u201d</span> she was about to ask, before stopping herself. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYou\u2026 you really are new to this, huh?\u201d</span> She staring at her feet for a while, as if considering her words carefully. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWell, then, I think you should know\u2026 people like us, who are friendly to anthros. Y\u2019know, \u2018anthro fanatics\u2019. It\u2019s not exactly a, uh, popular position to take,\u201d</span> she explains. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI don\u2019t know if you noticed, but these days, almost everyone in this country hates anthros. Like, more than ninety percent of people. Most people want them all dead. Others think they should all be abused and treated as slaves.\u201d</span> She sighs. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI do my best to help anthros, but in a society like this, well\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to register her words. <b>\u201cSo\u2026 you\u2019re saying someone smashed your windows in, just because of you like anthros?\u201d</b> you guess. <b>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThat\u2019s nothing,\u201d</span> Sally shrugged. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThis store\u2019s been through a lot of shit. It\u2019s had break-ins, robberies, vandalism\u2026 someone even tried to burn it to the ground a few years ago.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cJesus. I didn\u2019t realize it was that serious,\u201d</b> you say. At first, you just feel sympathy\u2026 but soon, that turns to fear. You own an anthro now. Were you going to receive the same treatment? Were people going to break into your apartment at night, or assault you on the street? You liked Mary, but\u2026 you weren\u2019t sure if you were willing to go through all that just to help her. Maybe you should just give her away, and put this whole thing behind you. However, you suddenly remember something that might make that decision easier for you. That conspiracy theory! If anyone would know the truth, it\u2019d be Sally, even if she might be a bit biased. <b>\u201cI, uh\u2026 I heard that anthros are just\u2026 \u2018programmed\u2019 to act the way they do. To manipulate people,\u201d</b> you ask. <b>\u201cIs there any truth to that?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cUgh,\u201d</span> she groans. You could tell she\u2019s heard that question before. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cIf you really want to know the grim truth, here it is: anthros like Mary are indeed artificially programmed to tend towards certain personality archetypes and mannerisms, to come off as \u2018cute\u2019 or \u2018sexy\u2019,\u201d</span> Sally explains, and for a moment, your heart sinks. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cBut she\u2019s not an unthinking, unfeeling parrot. The emotions she\u2019s feeling, and the thoughts she\u2019s having, are <i>genuine</i>, just like yours or mine. She\u2019s just wired a bit differently. Do you understand?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re honestly confused. <b>\u201cUh, no. I can\u2019t say I do,\u201d</b> you admit. <b>\u201cYou\u2019re saying she is, indeed, programmed to act a certain way, but\u2026 she has her own personality?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThink of it like this: humans are also programmed to act a certain way. We\u2019re genetically wired to want to breed and survive and use tools, and to find some things happy, and some things sad, and some things funny, et cetera. You know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</span> she explains in more detail. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cBecause our biological drive is to survive, reproduce and survive. An anthro\u2019s biological drive is to seem cute and charming, and to please their owners.\u201d</span> She leans back. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThey\u2019re just like us, but their psyche a little bit different. Do you understand now?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYeah, I think I do,\u201d</b> you nod. So Mary was actually programmed to seem cute, but she\u2019s still... sentient? You weren\u2019t sure if that revelation made you more or less comfortable. <b>\u201cSo, uh\u2026 this might be a stupid question, but can she read my mind?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally\u2019s serious demeanor was dropped immediately, and she burst out laughing. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cNo, Mr. Garcia. She cannot,\u201d</span> she says. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThough like any animal, she might be particularly perceptive of your emotions. More than you might think.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary returns, her arm wrapped around the avian\u2019s shoulder. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMaster, meet Rose! She\u2019s the first anthro I\u2019ve met in a decade!\u201d</span> she says, excitedly, introducing you to the uncomfortable-looking bird. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cDid you know that she has a job? A <i>real</i> job! That she gets paid for!\u201d</span> This is the first time you\u2019ve seen someone so excited over the concept of a job since college. You guess, for someone who was used to being a slave, the simple idea of \u2018getting paid\u2019 was probably refreshing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe avian, \u2018Rose\u2019, wriggles out of Mary\u2019s grip, and shakes your hand. It was a bit awkward trying to shake the hand of someone who only had talons, but you managed. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cNice to meet ya, sir,\u201d</span> she smiled. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cYour feline\u2019s a bit of an handful, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cTo say the least,\u201d</b> you chuckle. <b>\u201cThough it's nice to see her dote on someone else for a change.\u201d</b> Now that you have a good look at her, you would say Rose appeared to be some sort of turkey. She was almost taller than you were, and definitely had a lot more meat on her bones than Mary does, though not an unhealthy amount. Her breasts, you were ashamed to notice, were huge, far bigger than any human being could handle. <b>\u201cNow, Mary, why don\u2019t we take a look around?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cI would be happy to show you around if you want. It\u2019s always nice to see new blood in this little subculture,\u201d</span> the turkey offered, and you nodded. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cOh yeah, and Sally, John wants to have a word with you. You can go back and call him -- I can handle this.\u201d</span> As Sally disappeared into a back room, Rose showed you around the store, explaining Mary\u2019s health in further detail, discussing the pros and cons of various food products and explaining various supplements. Apparently, an anthro\u2019s digestive system is surprisingly different from a human\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you get a bit tired of this subject. To be honest, you were still a bit more concerned with the whole \u2018robbery and vandalism\u2019 thing Sally mentioned earlier. <b>\u201cHow does a store this unpopular make due?\u201d</b> You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cWell, sometimes slaver owners, after accidentally beating their anthros a little too hard, will bring them here for a bit of medical treatment,\u201d</span> the turkey sighed. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cBut mostly we profit off a small group of very dedicated customers. In this region, anthro supporters are a tight-knit community.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cSo do you get to meet other anthros often, then?\u201d</span> Mary asks, inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cOh, all the time,\u201d</span> Rose smiled. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cHang around here enough, and you\u2019re bound to meet a new face sooner than later.\u201d</span> As you continue browsing, Mary suddenly finds something that strikes her fancy. Before you know it, she\u2019s waving a small, transparent bottle in your face, full of a green mixture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cLook! Catnip!\u201d</span> Mary says, excited. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cOh, back when I was younger, catnip was my favorite thing in the world!\u201d</span> You grabbed the bottle of catnip, examining it for a few moments. It cost basically nothing. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cCan we buy it? I\u2019ll make it up to you, I swear!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cCatnip? You sure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d</span> Rose raised a brow. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cDarling, I think <i>more</i> energy is the last thing you need.\u201d</span> You consider it for a moment. Giving Mary catnip probably wasn\u2019t a good idea in any respect whatsoever, but part of you wanted to see what would happen...</span></div></div>",

While Mary was distracted excitedly wandering the store, Rose pulled you aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cI was listening to your conversation with Sally,\u201d</span> the turkey notes, staring into your eyes. Her eyes were large and deeply orange. You couldn\u2019t decide if her avian features were endearing, or unnerving. <span class=\"corange\">\u201c\u2018Mary\u2019 there is looking pretty good after what she\u2019s been through.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh, uh\u2026 yeah. She recovered really quickly,\u201d</b> you nod. It sounded like she was complimenting you, but you also felt like she was serious about something. Her feathery hand felt a little weird and itchy gripping your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve helped her a lot,\u201d</span> she says, <span class=\"corange\">\u201cbut whenever you\u2019re around her, you just seem uncomfortable. Is there something wrong?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did she notice that? Apparently, she was a lot more observant than she seemed. <b>\u201cOh. It\u2019s nothing. I just\u2026 find her a bit unnerving,\u201d</b> you whisper. You felt a little guilty talking about Mary behind her back so much, but you really didn\u2019t want to put her through any more stress then she's already gone through. <b>\u201cShe\u2019s cute, I guess, but it\u2019s obvious she was designed to look that way.

That\u2019s why I bought her.\u201d</b> You remember what Mary was look when you first saw her. When you ponder how much Mary has changed so far, you realize how much she\u2019s changed you in return. When you\u2019re around Mary, you feel a little more happy, and a little less cynical. <b>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.

It\u2019s not like what the \u2018slaves\u2019 go through,\u201d</span> she says.  <span class=\"corange\">\u201cAnthro slaves come through here sometimes for medical treatment. Most are being beaten by their masters. Violated. Brainwashed.\u201d</span> She sighs. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do for them other than fix them up and offer them some kind words.

You\u2019re planning on auctioning Mary off at the first opportunity. And I just wanted to know that if you do that, you\u2019ll be dealing her a death sentence.\u201d</span> She glances at the feline, the two of you noticing how cheerful and innocent Mary seemed. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cShe\u2019ll be bought up by some sadist who\u2019ll do things to her you can\u2019t even imagine for the rest of her life. You understand?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re at a loss of words for a few moments. You didn\u2019t expect the turkey to come at you in such an accusatory way. You couldn\u2019t say she was wrong, though.

He's around 28 years old, wears tracksuits everywhere, smokes and drinks too much, and is involved in shady businesses like buying and selling slaves. He has no job because he broke his own leg and made it look like an accident, and gets disability checks from the government... which he spends on tracksuits, cigarettes, and beer. Zak has far too much time on his hands. So, Zak has no real morals and isn't too smart. He's also got a real sadistic streak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Zakhar decided he wanted to go buy a slave. He'd helped his slaver friends move boxes full of animal-people and crates of tinies in his handicap-van before, but he'd never thought to buy one. Zak hobbled on into the slave pens to look around, where he was met by his buddy, Slavebroker Nick.<br>\r\n\"Ah, Zak! What brings you here? Thinking about buying a slave?\" Nick said.<br>\r\nZak nodded.<br>\r\n\"Sure am! What you got for me?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, how much you got?\" Nick said.<br>\r\nZak got out his wallet and showed Nick his disability check, which was enough to buy most slaves Nick had available.<br>\r\n\"Ooh, spending your beer money here today?\" Nick said.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm trying to cut down beer so I don't get fat.\" Zak said.<br>\r\n\"Well, you can get most any slave you want here, Zak my boy. Have a look around.\" Nick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak hobbled around the pens. All around him were animal-people called anthros, sitting in cages. Most were either nude or wore only tattered scraps of clothing. There were also terrariums full of tiny people, only a few inches tall about the size of a small action figure. They were in a semi-natural habitat and wore scraps and rags like loincloths, almost like a little tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that caught Zak's eye was a horse-girl, a girl with horse-like features like hooves and ears. Zak wanted to take her home and torment her... but he also saw a box full of naked tiny women, and those might be fun to torment too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich does Zak pick?</span></div></div>",

All three of them were quite skinny and rather frightened.<br>\r\n\"Oh, these girls are cute. Can you tell me about them?\" Zak said.<br>\r\nSlavebroker Nick laughed.<br>\r\n\"Oh these three! they are inseparable friends! Let me tell you.\" Nick said.<br>\r\nHe picked up one, a shy, long-haired blonde girl completely naked, her hair covering her petite breasts. She was a little bit smaller and scrawnier than the other two.<br>\r\n\"This is Anna, she is shy and cute, very adorable! The other girls tend to boss her around and take her things, that is why she is naked. That is also why I put her with the two nicest girls.\" Slavebroker Nick said.<br>\r\nHe set Anna back down and lifted up a second girl. The second girl wore a red thong and matching red bra. She had thick black hair that went down to her shoulders.<br>\r\n\"This is Lynette. She is friendly and likes to serve her master. Right, little one?\" Nick said.<br>\r\nLynette smiled up at him.<br>\r\n\"Please treat me nice...\" The small girl said, nervously.<br>\r\nNick laughed again and set her back down. Finally, he picked up a third girl, a short haired blonde wearing a black thong and red skirt. She made no effort to hide her breasts, which were a bit larger than her two friends. She stood proudly.<br>\r\n\"And finally, this is proud little Nikita. She thinks she is best slave on market but she is just a koo-koo hussy! Ha ha!\" Nick said.<br>\r\n\"Hey! I am no hussy!\" Nikita snapped.<br>\r\nZak smiled.<br>\r\nThey are perfect. I will buy them!\" He exclaimed, handing Slavebroker Nick his cash.<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to do business, Zakhar. Come back anytime!\" Nick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak quickly carried the small box of tiny women back to his place. The box, in addition to the girls, contained a small bed, some tiny-sized food, and some other things like hair brushes and a litter box. Yes, a litter box.<br>\r\n\"Oi, what was Nick thinking? Tiny humans don't use litter box like cats!\" Zak said.<br>\r\nHe decided to get the girls cleaned up first before he did anything else with them. He set the box down near his kitchen sink and started filling up the basin with warm water.<br>\r\n\"Tiny girls! I give you bath! Remove your scrap clothes and get in the sink!\" Zak commanded.<br>\r\nNikita and Lynette removed what little clothing they had while Anna nervously made her way into the water.<br>\r\n\"Oh... this feels good!\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Zak treat the girls in the sink-bath?</span></div></div>",

He poured a bit into the sink basin and got a bit on the brush too. He set about gently scrubbing his tiny slave girls. He started with Anna, gently washing her back and her long hair.<br>\r\n\"Oh, that feels so good!\" The Tiny squeaked.<br>\r\nLynette noticed the smaller girl getting more attention and quickly pushed Anna away.<br>\r\n\"Wash me! Wash me!\" Nikita said.<br>\r\nShe shoved the smaller, weaker Anna down and the long-haired blonde fell down into the waist-deep water with a splash. Zak laughed at her, \"what a clumsy and pathetic girl!\" He thought.<br>\r\nAnna stayed down, about up to her neck in soapy water, looking sad and a little humiliated as her master washed the slightly taller and stronger Nikita. You extended a finger for her to grab onto and lift herself up.<br>\r\n\"Oh, do not pout, little woman. I will wash you too.\" Zak said, resuming using the brush on Anna.<br>\r\nAnna felt slightly better, but only a little. She was still a feeling somewhat betrayed that Nikita would shove her around like that. Anna thought they were friends and the moment they got a master she pushes her around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak washed up his three slave girls diligently, giving each one a thorough cleaning all over their bodies and washing their hair well too. One they were all finished, he gave them some wash rags, comically oversized for the girls, to dry off with. They got back into their meager clothing, Lynette into her bra and saucy panties, Nikita into her panties and skirt, and Anna remaining nude. Anna tried to keep her washcloth at first and cover herself with that, but Zak would have none of it.<br>\r\n\"No! Give me washcloth now! You stay naked, little woman! That washcloth needs to go in dirty laundry basket.!\" Zak growled.<br>\r\nTimidly, Anna gave it right up and stayed exposed. She was so jealous of the other two girls, getting have clothes. Zak noticed how frustrated the naked girl was and patted her head with two fingers.<br>\r\n\"Do not fret, tiny woman Anna. I will buy you some girlie-doll panties next time I go to toy store.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"R... really?\" Anna said.<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not? They will be cute and pink and if the other two tiny women steal them from you I will punish them.\" Zak said, smiling.<br>\r\n\"You really would? Thank you, master!

They make holes in walls and steal food and shit on floor. Your job, tiny slave girls, is to hunt and kill rats.\" Zak said.<br>\r\nLynette gasped and Anna quivered in fear, while Nikita haughtily laughed.<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't it make more sense to have a cat for this?\" Anna said, almost cowering in fear.<br>\r\nZak laughed.<br>\r\n\"Cats are stupid animals, little slave girls are smart. Besides, cats cannot use this!\" Zak said, getting out a small box.<br>\r\nInside the small box were several Tiny-Sized machine guns, AK-47 Micros as they were known. They were specially made for Tinies for protecting themselves against predators. The bullets couldn't really harm humans, being so small they could only give a man a splinter at most, but against rats and other vermin they were quite potent.<br>\r\n\"You hunt rats with guns. You are tiny slave-soldiers now! My slave-soldiers!\" Zak said.<br>\r\n\"Bring it on! I will make them all dead!\" Nikita boasted.<br>\r\nZak smiled.<br>\r\n\"You, I like you!\"<br>\r\nShe picked up the gun and quickly figured out how to hold it. Lynette had some trouble figuring it out and Anna had could barely lift the metal weapon. <br>\r\n\"Oof! Guns are heavy!\" Anna whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak quickly explained how to shoot, how to use the sights, and how to reload, as well as some quick basic safety tips, since he didn't want his slave-soldiers to accidentally shoot themselves or each other. He had them practice on a wedge of moldy cheese from his refrigerator, and then sent them off on the rat hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikita, being the bravest, took point. She led the other two toward a rat hole in the wall.<br>\r\n\"We go in!\" Nikita bravely exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"N... Nikita... I'm scared. And this gun is heavy and I'm cold and tired. Can we take a break?\" Anna said, her nude body quivering.<br>\r\nNikita smacked Anna on the back of the head.<br>\r\n\"Not until we're inside the rat lair where Master can't see us. We can't let our master see us sitting around. If we look useless he might kill us for being bad slaves!\" Nikita said.<br>\r\n\"But what if we are attacked by rats?\" Anna said.<br>\r\nThe naked girl was freaking out now. Just the thought of being eaten by a rat was enough to shake her. Anna wasn't really a fighter at her heart.<br>\r\n\"What if we shoot into the hole before we go in? You know, like a warning shot?\" Lynette suggested.<br>\r\n\"Great idea!\" Nikita said.<br>\r\nAnna lifted her weapon and fired into the darkness of the rat hole, screaming hysterically.<br>\r\n\"EEEEEEEEEEE!\" She shrieked, nearly ready to cry.<br>\r\nTo their surprise, they heard a pained grunt inside, followed by a loud thump. The three slave-soldiers looked on in bewilderment.<br>\r\n\"I will go in and look.\" Nikita said.<br>\r\nShe soon emerged, dragging a large fat dead rat by the tail behind her, dripping blood from almost a dozen bullet holes.<br>\r\n\"I... I killed a rat?\" Anna said, surprised.<br>\r\n\"You sure did! First confirmed kill! Good job, Anna!\" Nikita said.<br>\r\n\"Wow, Anna, I didn't think you had it in you.\" Lynette said.<br>\r\nAnna smiled and blushed. She wasn't used to being complimented like this.<br>\r\n\"Th...

Where there weren't booths there were auctioneer platforms where you could see demihumans being sold off left and right. It was deplorable. \"Welcome to the Demihuman arena. Please, my booth is over this way,\" said Drex, smelling an opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrex lead Scott into a tent filled with cages, wasting no time to bring you to the larger species in the center of the tent. \"We have many species for sale. We have minotaurs, dragon newts, mammoths, and many more. Since you said you work on a farm, I have three slaves in mind. Here they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the first cage was a minotaur, a female with the lower half of a cow and the upper half of a human. She sat on her bottom in the center of the cage, mindlessly combing her brown and blonde hair with her fingers. She tried to hide it, but she looked at you with disgust as you walked up to the cage with Drex. \"This is our lovely minotaur, Ceria, one of our most recently obtained slaves. She is 6'8 and 500lbs. We found her out exploring one night, running away from her village. She was covered in cuts when we came across her. She ran to us panicked, said her name, and explained that she needed help as her village had been invaded by orcs. We subdued her fast and took her in, healed her wounds, and here she is. We tried to get more information out of her, but she doesn't trust us, no surprise there. Expect some resistance with her, but we have a remedy for that, heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second cage had a centaur. A very young stallion curled up in the center of the cage taking a nap. \"Here is a young lad, his name if Percious, like the Greek hero. He is about 5'4 and 350lbs, 16 years old. He isn't very strong, but he's proven to be smart as a whip. He still has plenty of time to grow up into something amazing, so it's up to you if you want to invest in him. His parents weren't happy to have him around. He was abused as a child and they eventually sold him to me about a year ago. We have been taking care of him since. Most people don't want to take care of children so it's been tough. However, you are looking for farm help, so you may want him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final cage contained an Anatolian Shepherd dog girl. She was incredibly alert and staring you and Drex down mystically. \"This is Azra. She's 6'2 and 200lbs. We found her abandoned in an ally way as a puppy. We took her in and raised her ourselves 18 years ago. We taught her all she would ever need to know on how to be a slave. She loves the idea of being one. I think she enjoys the concept of being a slave a little too much. She's very fast, energetic, and loyal to a fault. She can be a little simple at times as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott carefully pondered his options. There was the tall and muscular Ceria. Being a minotaur she was naturally well endowed, a detail Drex left out on purpose. In addition to her large bust, she sported horns and a tail. If you managed to get past her ample chest, she was quite muscular, a benefit for what you needed for the farm. The only issue could be her resentment towards humans after what happened to her. There was also that centaur Percious, poor child. His parents had bigger plans for him that fell short and they treated him like trash for it. You couldn't get an idea of his personality, all you knew that he was smart but weak. He would be an investment, so you needed to be patient. Finally, there was a dog girl Azra, very eager to be a slave. While you were looking for something strong, and she was a slender one, that loyalty could be a very helpful tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've made my choice Drex, I'll take _____.\"</span></div></div>",

While they walked towards the large center \"office\" tent Drex began to explain, \"I'm assuming you've never bought a slave before. Each slave is given a slave crest on the chest to mark them as your property. This has been a tradition for decades, but there was a problem with slaves running away so slave crests were given the ability to track the slave, and only recently can a crest force a slave to obey a command.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does the crest do all that?\" asked Scott<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They used to be branded like cattle, but a ritual was discovered that combined the owner's blood into a special liquid that is then pained on the slave. The blood bond is what is then used to track. Recently the ritual was enchanted to force the slave to obey orders. All you need to say is 'That's an order!' and they will a horrible shock if they don't obey. Ok, we're ready to begin. Please, take a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott sat down at the desk as Drex shuffled through the drawers. \"Here is the bill, I hope you have enough,\" said Drex as he slid a piece of paper across the desk. \"Of course I do. This should be enough\" Scott responded while putting a large pouch on the desk. Scott signed the bill of sale as Drex counted the cash. \"This is more than enough! Here is appropriate change, minus the cost of the crest.\" Drex was giddy at the sale, he passed some coins back to Scott and rummaged through a large box to pull out a very ornate looking dish with chemicals and a folder. \"This is the general slave care guide and minotaur species guide. Now for the crest ritual. Normally I would bring the slave here but as you've noticed Ceria, is very robust, so we'll do it in her cage.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrex pulled out a bell from his robes and rang it. Three very large men walked into the tent and stood by. Drex grabbed everything he needed and ushered everyone to follow him. Nobody spoke a word as they all walked to Ceria's cage. Once there Drex put down the dish on a nearby crate and brandished a knife. Scott walked over to him and let himself be sliced by the knife. It didn't hurt all that much as Scott watched the blood drip into the dish. Drex poured the chemicals into the dish and then some powder. Drex signaled the men to open the cage. Ceria took her chance to bolt out but the three were ready for that as one swept her legs and the two others pinned her to the floor.

Scott turned away, shielding his eyes as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Scott couldn't see any light through his eyes he turned to see the mark had gone from a blood liquid smeared on her to a very detailed tattoo. The crest was two rings bound together, one larger than the other. The two rings were inside a larger, spiked circle. \"And that's that. Ceria is now your slave. Feel free to leave whenever you please.\" \"Thank you\" replied Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott walked out of the cursed arena with Ceria close behind. Scott unlocked his dusty pick-up truck and had Ceria climb in as well. Scott started 'er up and took off wayward his farm in the middle of nowhere. It was a long, uncomfortable silence as Scott drove home. Ceria wouldn't even look in his general direction, choosing to stare at the window the whole drive with her chin on her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott pulled up to the farm, turned off his truck and got out, having Ceria do the same. Scott broke the silence by saying \"Welcome to my family farm. This is where you will be living from now on. It's about to be night time, so I will show you your room as I make dinner.\" Scott leads Ceria, who was strangely compliant this whole time, into the house and up the stairs.  Scott opened the door to Ceria's room and said, \"This is your room, wait here until I call you for dinner.\" The room was simple. A large fluffy bed, a dresser with a mirror, and a very \"old\" smell about. It was perhaps the nicest thing she has ever had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get comfortable. We'll get you some clothes tomorrow. Is there anything you would like to eat?\" asked Scott. Ceria hadn't said a single word this entire time, but now, she chose to answer. \"Vegetables, I want vegetables. I'm an herbivore, so no meat.\" Her voice was angelic. Scott was surprised but quickly composed himself. \"I'll call you when food is ready.\" Scott closed the door and walked off. Ceria crashed onto her new bed and was practically ecstatic. It was unbelivably comfortable. She could get lost in the feeling. </span></div></div>",

He first journeyed there in 1887, looking for gold. He had no luck prospecting, but noticed he had an aptitude in training the sled dogs, and a natural attunement with the bitter wilderness. When everyone else, including his wife, returned to their homes after the gold rush came to an end, Magomed remained in the Yukon; he could not imagine any other home. He now works as a trapper, capturing the rugged anthros of Canada and taming them with a firm hand, particularly huskies and other dogs. Selling these anthros to be slaves and pets served him well, for a time\u2026 but it was now entering the 1920s, and with recent technologies, the era of the sled dog quickly seemed to be over, and demand for his skills was dwindling. Perhaps he could find something else of value in this untamed wilderness\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Haoniyao Kirabo -</b> Growing up in rural Kenya, Katlego was once desperate for cash, but is now sitting on a fortune. His secret? Bored, wealthy families in the west and China are willing to pay extravagant amounts for properly trained exotic anthros. They make the most impressive pets, after all, and the most powerful slaves. He\u2019s so far mostly stuck to big cats, and rare birds like cassowaries\u2026 but business is drying up. There have been reports of exotic anthros rebelling and swallowing their own masters, and the authorities are increasingly cracking down on the whole industry. In order to keep the cash flowing, Haoniyao will have to think bigger, and capture an anthro nobody has ever managed to tame before...</span></div></div>",

Her semester exams were next week, and she knew she had to start studying early if she ever wanted to pass. So, she diligently sat there absorbing information for what had seemed like hours. <br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Kailey sighed as she put her head down in defeat and let out a loud groan. \"God, I hate chemistry!\" she just laid there, struggling to contain herself from having a violent outburst. Suddenly, there was a knocking at the front door. \"Huh? Oh...Who in their right mind would be here at this time of night? \" she got up to answer it, her bare feet being frozen by the wood floor, as she was wearing pajamas. \"Eep! Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold!\" Kailey exclaimed as she hopped over to the door. She unlocked it, turned the handle, and opened it. \"Hell...o?\" there was no one there. She stepped out onto the porch and looked to her left and right. There was no one walking through the street lamp illuminated snow drifts, there were no cars driving down the road slicked with ice, there weren't even any footprints leading to the door. Kailey just nervously shrugged it off. \"It's just the wind. Yeah. It's...just the wind.\" she turned to go back inside and return to her studies when she spied a small package at her feet. She tenderly picked it up and brought it inside to inspect it. Kailey placed the box next to her chemistry textbook and looked it over. It was a plain brown package with clear packing tape to seal the top, but there was no delivery or return address. Something else peculiar about this box was that there were tiny holes throughout the sides, the size of pinpricks. \"Oh, no...\" Kailey thought. \"What if there's an animal in there? I have to see...\" She took a sharp knife and carefully cut the tape open. She opened the box and peered inside, her eyes going wide with her discovery. \"Oh my god...What the hell is this?\"</span></div></div>",

Now he knew why. The thing's dark eyes scanned him, taking in every detail of his nude frame from his lithe rippling musculature, to his blond hair and blue eyes, to his masculine facial features.  He watched, frozen with terror as the monstrous being gingerly reached down and stroked his chest with her thumb. To his great discomfort, he realized he was only as tall as her thumb was long, about two inches. His heart was pounding as she never broke eye contact for a second. <br>\r\n\"N...no... No... No...

Those who had attended it opted for the more fitting \"Gate of Hell\" or \"The Slave House\". The outside was ordinary red brick. The property held a carefully cared for courtyard, encased with trimmed hedges around the perimeter. However, inside these hedges were electrified fences, should anyone get the bright idea to escape. Jason learned that the hard way.<br>\r\n\"Get moving.\" Barked one of the men flanking him. Jason hesitantly stepped through the doorway. He may have well been walking towards the electric chair. The room he entered must have been a rec room. Teens were sitting at tables playing cards or chatting, by the way they acted, it would appear they were at a summer camp that they voluntarily attended.<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna be here...\" Jason mumbled, as if he had any choice.<br>\r\n\"You should have thought of that before.\" The guard responded. \"Up this way.\" He said, gesturing to a staircase. Jason followed him. Upstairs appeared to be some sort of dormitory, the long hallway painted a pastel blue for boys. \"Come on.\" The man placed a gloved hand on the doorknob of a door inscribed with the number 25. It creaked open, revealing the ordinary room. <br>\r\n\"Oh! Hi there. You must be Jason, is that right?\" A man stood in the middle of the room with an unending smile on his face.<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" Jason nodded, taken aback severely. This reaction didn't dampen the man's enthusiasm in the slightest.<br>\r\n\"Well, this is where you'll be staying. I was just checking to make sure it was all set up for you. My name's Chad, by the way, and I'll be your handler during your experience here. Your schedule is posted on the back of the door there, if you don't report to your scheduled activity someone will be up to check on you. Dinner's at five, and in about an hour after you've had time to adjust, you'll be taken to your initial evaluation. Any questions?\" Chad's smile never faltered once.<br>\r\n\"How long am I gonna be here?\" Jason asked warily.<br>\r\n\"Well that all depends on you. Kids with certain attributes can get out within a week, while those with a more defiant nature typically stay for about a month undergoing conversion therapy (A/N: no not that kind of conversion therapy, you sickos). However, those kids can get out a lot faster, depending on what's in demand.\" Chad grinned, \"Does that answer your question?\"<br>\r\n\"S-Sure...\" Jason stammered. Conversion therapy? Kids being in demand? What the hell was this place, some sort of underage whorehouse?<br>\r\n\"So, I guess if that's all cleared up I'll let you get settled.\" Chad turned towards the door, being followed by the two guards. \"I hope you have a nice time here.\" He said, closing the door and leaving Jason alone. Jason sighed, laying down on the bed.<br>\r\n\"I really don't wanna be here...\" He murmured, unable to shake the dread in his stomach. He spread his arms and legs, hitting something awkward on the corner of the bed. \"Huh?...\" Jason sat up and inspected it.<br>\r\nLeather straps. </span></div></div>",

He had been severely upset over his parents' decision but he could see where they were coming from. The more he thought about it, the sicker he felt. There was a secret to this place. Something that only lived through kids and teens as rumors, that was revealed as truth during adulthood if you managed to not get sent to one of these awful places. Jason laughed a dry, spiteful laugh. It was only when faced with the consequences that he ever gave his actions a second thought. A knock at the door startled him slightly. <br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Jason asked as he opened the door. A thin woman in her thirties smiled at him from the other side.<br>\r\n\"Ah. You must be Jason, correct?\" she replied as Jason opened the door further.<br>\r\n\"Who wants to know?\" <br>\r\n\"My name is Erin. I'll be escorting you to your initial evaluation.\" She responded. Jason begrudgingly followed her down the hallway, heading towards a separate wing of the building. After a few minutes of walking, Jason attempted to make small talk.<br>\r\n\"So...\" He started, \"What exactly do you do with kids once they've completed their tests or reached your standard or whatever?\" Under his breath, he murmured, \"because they sure as hell don't go home.\"<br>\r\n\"You'll see...\" Erin replied, the slightest bit of irritation creeping into her voice. Jason tried again,<br>\r\n\"I uh... I notice there were leather straps on my bed. Why is that?\"<br>\r\n\"Protocol.\" Erin shrugged, swiping a key card and opening a door. \"In here, please.\" <br>\r\n\"Yes, but why?\" Jason strained.<br>\r\n\" Look, some of our arrivals have very violent tendencies. Make of that what you will.\" Erin snapped, not in the mood for anymore questions. <br>\r\n\"Alright, alright...\" Jason responded tensely as he stepped into the room. Note to self: Don't piss anyone off while you're here.<br>\r\n\"Hi, you must be Jason.\" Another woman approached him, dressed in a lab coat. Probably a doctor. She shook his hand. \"Today we're going to do your initial evaluation as to make your transition as painless as possible. If you'd take a seat on that bench over there.\" She gestured to the far wall. Jason gazed around as he wandered towards the bench. This whole place looked like a doctor's office. Jason hated the doctor's office.<br>\r\n\"Transition?\" Jason asked as he took a seat. \"What transition?\" The woman stared at him with icy eyes before turning away, acting like she hadn't heard him. <br>\r\n\"So, I need you to answer a few questions for me, Jason.\" She requested coolly, taking a seat behind a computer monitor.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n\"Blonde hair... Blue eyes...\" She murmured as she typed something into her computer. \"Alright then! General demeanor?\" She finally asked him.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" <br>\r\n\"You know, cheerful, moody, quick to anger?\" She clarified, not looking up from her computer.<br>\r\n\"Uh... Mild? I don't really know... A little jaded?\" He answered tentatively.<br>\r\n\"Really?\" She asked with genuine interest, \"Because your file says something quite different.\" Jason's insides twisted.<br>\r\n\"What do they say...?\"<br>\r\n\"Reckless. Violent when drunk.\" She responded flatly, a tiny sadistic smirk curling on the edges of her lips.<br>\r\n\"THAT WAS ONE TIME!\" Jason objected pathetically. The woman raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n\"Well, it wasn't just one time. It was never just one time. If it was, you wouldn't be here.\" She leaned in, \"Would you?\"<br>\r\n\"No...\" He answered tearfully. \"Probably not.\" The woman stood up from her computer.<br>\r\n\"Well... That's it for the oral part of the examination. I'm going to need you to remove your clothing for this next part.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Jason was at a loss for words but hesitantly took his shirt off.<br>\r\n\"I need assistance in Examination Room B.\" The woman went over intercom. Soon enough, a man and a woman entered, also dressed in lab coats.<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Jason asked as the hair on the back of his neck stood up.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" The man responded, stepping over to a stainless steel examination table that Jason had somehow missed before.<br>\r\n\"It'll be easiest if you just cooperate...\" The woman responded, holding his left arm and making a tourniquet. She held a syringe filled with a mystery drug, preparing to shove its needle into his muscle. \"Now, just relax...\" She cooed.<br>\r\n\"Get that thing away from me!\" Jason screamed, jerking his arm out of her grasp. He looked around wildly. Three very angry doctors and... The door. The door out of here. </span></div></div>",

Otherwise it would have been locked. <br>\r\n\"Shit... \" Jason looked both ways. Identical corridors. He sprinted down the left hallway, the one he thought he remembered coming from. His uneven footsteps pounded on the tile as he made his escape. Were he not so panicked, he may have found it odd that none of the doctors gave chase.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps his therapy regimen should be more rigorous?\" The male doctor suggested, completely ignoring the patient tearing down the hallway.<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" The primary doctor replied, entering the note into Jason's file. \"I believe it would be beneficial to him if we bumped up his projected exit time by a week or two. Considering recent events, this should be brought to the administration's attention immediately.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll do so right away.\" The male doctor replied, picking up a hard copy of Jason's file and hurrying out the door.<br>\r\nJason, meanwhile, had no clue where he was. This wing was a far cry from the brightly colored dormitories and rec rooms meant to keep the captive kids content. This wing was clinical, white walls, tiled floors, and keypad locked doors. Jason shivered. It was medical, but there was no aura of healing to be found. Jason felt that if he managed to open one of these doors he would see some kid strapped down and experimented on like a lab rat. What was going on? He continued until the end of the hall. Nothing looked familiar. To his left there was a heavy steel door with an observation window. To his right there was a door with a staircase leading further down into the complex. In his current predicament, either one seemed preferable to being caught. </span></div></div>",

This place had a secret, he knew that much. Though... one thing rubbed him the wrong way, putting a lump in his throat and making his hands shake. Why was no one chasing him? It would make sense if they had just lost track of him in the complex with all the identical hallways, but as far as Jason knew, no one had gone after him the second he bolted from the examination room. He shuddered as he placed his hands against the cool metal door, not daring to look through the examination window. He leaned up against it just a bit and to his surprise... it opened. His mouth went dry and his breathing quickened. Shouldn't it be locked by keycard or entry code like every other fucking door in this wretched place? Maybe even just a simple fucking padlock, but no, there was no lock to be found. A muffled grunt came from beyond the door. Jason shivered. He fully pushed the door open and stepped inside. What he saw would forever haunt his mind.<br>\r\nA stainless steel table sat in the center of the otherwise bare room, looking uncomfortably similar to a sacrificial altar. IV bags surrounded the table, pumping God knows what into the poor soul writhing on the table. He was held down with those all too familiar leather straps. What were they doing to him? Jason cautiously approached him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey... My name's Jason, I'm gonna-!\" Jason jumped back, sickened by what lay before him. That thing was monstrous. Its head was shaved, giving view to ugly criss-crossing scars on its scalp along with fresh incisions sewn up with thick black thread. Jason gagged. Did they give this kid a lobotomy? \"Wh-what in the hell did they do to you?...\" he whispered. Its green eyes nearly bored a hole into Jason's skull with its unrelenting stare. It silently moved its lips, trying to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is none of your concern.\" An icy chill ran up Jason's back as firm hands were placed on his shoulders. He was spun around to face a very angry doctor. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I... I was...\" Jason stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not supposed to be here.\" the doctor asserted, pushing Jason through the door and into the hallway, leaving the experiment behind. \"For now, I'll chalk it up to a simple mistake. But I warn you that for your own sake, you'll forget what you saw here today.\" Jason was stunned. The doctor continued, \"I'm going to take you back to your room, and you'll continue your schedule as normal, understood?\" Jason nodded nervously.</span></div></div>",

Not even one day here and you've already been bumped up a week or two for projected exit time.\" The doctor paused, stared deep into Jason's eyes, and continued morbidly, \"That's not a good thing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason couldn't help but imagine being tied up and assaulted relentlessly by multiple men and women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But where will I <i>go</i>?\" Jason pressed.

For now, I would just recommend shaping up your behavior.

After dinner, you will attend a session on beauty, spa treatments, and general wellness, which takes place in Room 204. When that is said and done, you'll have two hours before lights out. I'll speak with your handler as to when you can... make up... your evaluation, with some minor adjustments to your file. Also, if you'd like, you may skip the gym class for today.

Unfortunately, the law was not in his favor, stating that in the event anyone crossed the line of their 18th birthday while in an assignment camp, they would still be proccessed as if they weren't a legal adult, leaving kids who \"aged out\" no reprieve. \"How about you sit down and we can talk?\" Rose suggested, patting the couch cushion next to her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"S-sure.\" Jason stammered, taking a seat next to the perky girl. \"So, uh...\" Jason attempted to start a conversation, \"What brought you all here?\" His eyes widened as Rose's hand quickly clamped over his mouth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We're um...

I'm very much an \"act now, think later\" sort of person and it's gotten me into a lot of screwed up shit over the years. One day, I \"woke up\" and found myself behind the wheel of my parents' car, heading out to God knows where.\" He laughed regretfully. \"I should have asked for help, or something like that, but I fucked myself over and my parents signed that order before I could get a word in edgewise.\" Connor paused. \"I've got a younger brother, about fifteen. I wonder...\" He swallowed, sounding like he was on the verge of tears, \"I wonder how he feels when he wakes up and I'm not there anymore?\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How long have you been here, Connor?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"They don't normally give you a way to accurately judge days, but... going by day and night cycles, I'd say... about two weeks?\" He smiled sarcastically and scoffed. \"Even when you're halfway out of this fucking place they don't tell you where you're going. It could be anything from being locked in jail to being fed through a woodchipper, and I'm <i> still </i> none the wiser.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait a second...

So much so that our parents don't want to deal with us anymore. It's times like this that I wonder if <i> they </i> know where we're going...\" Connor's shoulders drooped a bit. \"Oh, but Matt's got one <i> hell </i> of a story. Don't you, Matt?\" smirked Connor. \"Get this... Matt's parents had him <i> specifically </i> to give him up to this place.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shut your mouth.\" Matt fired back. \"At least my parents <i> wanted </i> me. \" Jason could see tiny twitches in Connor's facial muscles as his jaw clamped down. Matt had definitely hit a nerve. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Stop fighting!\" Jason shouted, earning the stares of a few other teens in the room. \"Matt, did your parents tell you anything about why you're here or why you were even <i> born </i>?\" Matt shook his head. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The only thing they told me was... I was going to serve a great purpose. They said I was destined to save others, to bring comfort to those in pain, and to sacrifice myself for the sake of the greater good.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How long have they been telling you this?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ever since I could understand them.

That's too much of a reward to give up.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Matt?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This plan sucks.\" Matt stated bluntly. \"But I'll help.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright then.\" smiled Rose coyly. \"It's settled.\"</span></div></div>",

He suddenly felt earthquakes, he knew he was dead if he got caught here attempting to escape. He felt some form of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for some reason but he coulden't tell why, but this wasn't the time to think about his past. His heart began pounding somewhere around 200 pumps per second (rough estimate) as the giant figure of the girl stood in the massive door way. \"I'm bac... Huh where are you?\" She was confused, this was his big chance he just needed to give it his all just for this few seconds... \"AAAAAHHHHHH!!\" He screamed in agony as he tried to move at all. \"Huh...\" She looked right at him and her face turned not to anger but to a more scarred face if anything. She quickly sat down all the objects as she rushed over to Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're gonna be ok just don't move your leg\" Jason couldn't really believe it... was this girl about to try and save him... Kailey was as careful as she could be picking him up and placing him down on the table. She managed to make a makeshift cast form out of random things from her desk. Jason was shocked at this he had never heard of a gentle giant they were always meant to be these uncaring monsters, but she was... Kind, Nice, Gentle, and admittedly cute (for a giant). \"Now why were you on the floor with a broken leg, you weren't trying to run, were you?\" Jason feared admitting it the last thing he wanted to do was make her mad or anything else really. \"No... I... I slipped and broke my leg on accident\" Jason sputtered, judge from her unamused face she wasn't buying it. \"For staters don't lie to me no matter what, and 2nd don't try to run away at you tiny I could easily crush you on accident or something else could get you, do you understand\" Jason just nods his head...</span></div></div>",

He gasped as he tripped backwards, cracking his head against the wooden table below. He closed his eyes and placed his hands on the sides of his head. This was wrong. This was all so, so wrong. Pain radiated everywhere. He wasn't meant to be here. He felt something graze against his leg and reflexively kicked it. He opened his eyes to the sight of the giant girl trying to get a hold on him. Maybe he hadn't learned from the first time he had tried to defend himself, or maybe it was just  the magnitude of his terror, but he began to slam his foot into her fingers and punch and claw at her hands in desperation. \"STAY AWAY FROM ME!\" He screamed. \"STAY AWAY!\" Jason grunted as he rolled over and crawled away from Kailey as fast as he could. Unfortunately for him, she was faster. Her hand clamped around him, restricting his movement as she raised him to her face.</span></div></div>",

Jason screamed as he hit the ground. He sucked in air through gritted teeth as he rolled himself over. He counted himself lucky he wasn't dead from the fall. As soon as he looked upwards, his heart plummeted. She was even larger than he originally thought... No, he was more insignificant than he could have ever imagined.

The muscles around him clenched as Kailey's toes curled and he was forced farther into her womanhood. He struggled and screamed as her flesh began to suffocate him. Unfortunately, his thrashing only excited Kailey more. In his desperation, he kicked, bit, and clawed at her skin to no avail.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please!

Jason bit down on the flesh in front of him as hard as he could. To his relief, it didn't seem to hurt her.

The rest of her existence (which may not be very long) controlled by a monster the size of a mountain. Snow sighed wearily and slumped her head down in defeat. The entire experience was beyond surreal. She had heard tales of goblins and gremlins, of awful sickly creatures dwelling in caves far from civilization. Those were monsters. This person, this THING she was faced with now was beyond anything her mind could conjure up. Snow glanced up suddenly, a fluffy sound snapping her from her thoughts. The giantess loomed above her for a moment, then left to tend to her own business. Snow looked next to herself. The giantess had deposited a large square of soft fabric as well as a ball of cotton into Snow's prison. Bedding. Snow shivered violently, eyeing the blanket and the thick clothing. Surely those would keep her warm. No! She had to resist. She would not bend, she would not break. Snow's stomach growled and she shivered so hard her teeth were chattering. She must keep her resolve!

Snow was still trying to come up with a reason not to trust this giant maybe she's ratting me up to eat me later! no... maybe she's tricking me into thinking she's nice so I don't try to run... or... No this giant wasn't anything like the ones in the stories. For one thing the giant was quite... Cute in a giant girl way, she was kind unlike the Giants who supposedly go around destroying entire villages, and she wasn't talking down to her or treating her like an insect. Giants aren't supposed to be kind are they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kailey smiled down at her tiny little snowflake which was the new little nickname she came up for her. She felt like this had to be a dream or something she would never had thought she'd have a tiny girl like this, it was like one of the little stories her mom would read her when she was little. Ever since Kailey was a little girl she was always teased about her height (she was short in comparison to everyone around her, especially her own family) which why she always wanted to be a giant being able stand up for herself and feel like she had some sort of power for a change. But she wasn't big on the whole killing tines thing though she'd want to be a gentle giant one who could people with any problem (not involving anything only tinies could do). She could protect everyone she cared about and so much more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kailey decided to check the weather on her phone and was pleasantly surprised to see \"Schools closed for multiple days due to large snow storms.

Snow repeated this statement over and over in her head as she lifted the food and spilled it onto her cardboard prison's floor, smashing the dishes to pieces for good measure. She moved to the clothes and shivered. No. She mustn't. Snow grabbed each garment and methodically tore them at the seams until they were nothing but rags at her feet.

I don't know\" Snow began to tear up as she realized the giant was just trying to take care of her. \"Don't cry it's alright I have more clothes and stuff just don't break them okay\" snow nods. \"I'm pathetic aren't I\" snow thought to herself, Snow accepted the gifts but she still didn't trust this giant no matter... \"What?\" Asked the half asleep giant as Snow had woken her up. \"Is it okay if I sleep with you the cloth you gave me isn't comfy...\" \"Fine just don't wake me up in the middle of the night.

I'm dreaming *sigh*\". Snow always could tell if she was dreaming or not it was something everyone knew about back home... A tear ran down her face when she thought back to her home, suddenly the world seemed to shift and transform into a jungle (which in reality was just some think grass).

Snow could travel into people's memories and explore, she was mostly just an observer though...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Currently young Snow was just wandering around attempting to climb one of the many \"trees\" around her when she noticed someone else in the think jungle looking confused as ever. Snow decided she was gonna scare him that was something she loved doing to people it was fun seeing how far they'd run unaware that it was just a little girl who scared him. She was right behind him when... SNAP a little branch snapped under her foot, suddenly the man turned around and the look on his face wasn't terror it looked like he was angry then she noticed the sword in his hand and she went pure white pale...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What the hell are you doing here you...

There\" Snow placed her hand on his head and soon she was somewhere scary... It was a dark room with two shady figures chatting the memory blocked out ones face but she could see Steve clearly. The shadowy figure went on about a \"package\" in icton or the big city he gave a map with directions ,she looked over them and engraved them to his mind...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n When she came to again she saw Steve's face in pure terror he kept muttering something...

I really don't, but you must understand my business is my business and nothing, not you, not anyone, is going to get in my way. Now, little girl, turn around and go home before I do something I'll regret.\" Steve sheathed his weapon and hoisted his bag higher on his back, turning towards the weathered dirt trail. Snow blew a strand of her icy white hair out of her face in displeasure. \"Child\"? \"Little girl\"? She was nearly sixteen and of marrying age! She was no child. She looked up to retort, but she was alone. In the loose dirt that led through the winding forest she spotted a set of footprints that hadn't been there before, probably belonging to that strange man. Snow followed them, always needing to have the last word in an argument. A foolish decision, her mother had always warned her. Further and further into the foreboding wood they went, much further than Snow had ever been allowed to go. Suddenly, the path of footsteps vanished. Squinting through the trees, she could make out a vaguely human figure.<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" She shouted, against her better judgement. The figure glanced up in alarm, suddenly doubling his efforts going through the trees. Snow found herself bobbing and weaving around thick brush as she tried to stay in pursuit. \"Please, I just want to--!\" Snow found herself in a clearing with no man in sight and no clear way of getting home. \"Good going.\" She chastised herself. The clearing clearly served a purpose at some point, a pit dug in the ground with the charred remains of a fire  in it. Nearby, perhaps fifty feet away was some sort of structure. As Snow approached, she realized it was a building, similar in appearance to a shanty house. However, its structural integrity left much to be desired, its wooden outside in various stages of rot and covered in a layer of moss. Out of her own curiosity, Snow peeked through one of the shattered windowpanes. Inside, the building was...</span></div></div>",

Snow crept towards the door, finding it to be unlocked against all odds. Her better judgement told her to turn around right now and find a town where they could direct her back towards home. Turn around and pretend you saw nothing. Though Snow knew it was foolish, she stepped into the house. She knelt on the floor, ignoring the sticky substance that coated it. She reached over to the person nearest to her, a pretty blonde woman who looked to be in her twenties. Snow pulled the cloth gag from the woman's mouth. <br>\r\n\"Go away! Run! Run away from this horrible place!\" The woman protested.<br>\r\n\"Please... I just... Want to... Help... You!\" Snow responded as the woman dodged Snow's attempts to release her bonds.<br>\r\n\"No!

Get out of here!\" The woman urged as Snow finally slipped off her bonds and moved to the next person.<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna set you free, okay?\" Snow assured the young man as she started to untie the tight knots with her nimble fingers. Snow jumped half a foot in the air as a bang echoed outside, accompanied by a man's rough voice.<br>\r\n\"You saying you found a girl and didn't take the cunt in?

He was definitely bad news.

A second man stepped through the door, one who Snow recognized. It was Steve. \"Anybody ever teach you how to tie knots, boy?\" the man asked, his words dripping with ire. <br>\r\n\"I-I uh...\" Steve stammered, \"I could've sworn they were tight when I tied her...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right...\" The man backhanded the blonde, sending her to the floor. \"You're damn lucky she's broke enough to not run. First you lose a sale, then your knots ain't tight, why I ever hired a fuckup like you I'll never know.\" He grumbled, \"Go check the rest of your shit knots so we don't have anymore 'incidents'.\"<br>\r\n\"... Yes sir.\" Steve responded, frustration evident in his voice. Snow closed her eyes and tensed in anticipation as the heavy footsteps grew closer. She cringed as the footsteps stopped. \"Wait a minute...\" Snow gasped as a sharp pain erupted in her scalp, her long white hair entangled in Steve's fingers as he dragged her towards his superior.<br>\r\n\"LET GO!\" she shouted. Steve complied, shoving her roughly at the feet of the older man, pinning her on her hands and knees.<br>\r\n\"This is the girl. The one I met back in the forest.\"<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" The older man leered at Snow, running his dirty thumb across Snow's full pink lips and into her mouth. \"I'll get a lot for you...\" Snow was held in place by sheer terror as the disgusting old man walked over to her backside. He lifted her skirt and moved her panties aside, getting a good look at her shaved cunt. His index finger wormed its way between her lips, meeting slight resistance. \"You virgin? Oh, they're so rare on the market these days, but something like you, well I can hardly stop from breaking you in myself...\"</span></div></div>",

How could she have been so stupid? <br>\r\n\"Here we go.\" Steve returned with two fair lengths of rope.<br>\r\n\"\"Good...\" The man replied, his voice a low rattle. The man was mounted on top of Snow, similar to a dog getting ready to mate. \"Get her arms and legs.\" He demanded as he stroked Snow's hair and slowly unbuttoned the two buttons of her tunic. Steve complied, wrapping the rope from Snow's wrists to halfway up her forearm, then the other from her ankles to her calves.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\" Steve told Snow.<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" The man laughed. \"You're sorry?! You ain't a real man! Maybe after I'm done with this whore I'll pull down your pants and fuck you in the ass like the sissy you really are! A real man ain't sorry for nothin' he does!\" The man continued to laugh. Steve clenched his teeth and blushed deeply from embarrassment. The man grabbed Snow's right breast and squeezed, taking his erect cock out of his pants with his left hand. <br>\r\n\"Please...\" Snow whimpered again as the man released Snow's breast and ripped off her panties.<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna fuck that tight little cunt of yours, whether you like it or not.\" He hissed in Snow's ear while he shoved his cock into her and began to pound her. He roughly grabbed her shoulders for leverage as he went harder, regardless of Snow's screams of agony. Her virgin hole was unused to something so thin as a tampon, that someone so endowed as this man made Snow feel as though she were being split in half, or fucked with sandpaper.<br>\r\n\"Nngh... Hah...\" Snow murmured, barely able to form a coherent thought through the pain. Her fingers scratched at the floor, trying to get away. She had heard of sex being a wonderful bonding moment of singularity between two lovers, her experience was none of those things.  She breathed deeply and tried to hold on. <br>\r\n\"Take it, you fucking cunt. You're gonna be a mother when all of this is over! Oh fuck...\" The man growled. Snow froze as a warmth spread through her abdomen. Tears ran down her cheeks and she slumped over on the floor as the man pulled his flaccid cock from inside her. He had raped her. He had taken her purity. He had impregnated her. Snow vomited off to the side and started shivering uncontrollably as the two men stared down at her. </span></div></div>",

In fact she was more curious than ever, she was probably one of the only tinies in the world of Giants these areas have never been explored... Or the explores... Died.  Snow walked over to the giant hand siting right in the middle of her cell. Kailey's finger tip was about as tall as snow was, snow hoped up and tried to pull herself up on top of the giant fingertip it was proving difficult given that snow wasn't really strong enough to grip onto her skin. Kailey held in her laughter watching the tiny Snowflake struggle to climb up just the tip of her finger, eventually she just pinched her up and dropped her in her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Snow failed and screamed like she was on some sort of rollercoaster as she suddenly went flying. Landing gracefully (face first) into her open palm. Suddenly it felt like her entire world was shaking as Kailey lifted her hand out of the box as carefully as she could. Still in wasn't careful enough to keep Snow on her feet... Snow was set down next to some sort of massive  monolithic... Thing. Snow was starring at a computer, Kailey quickly snatched up her jacket, pants, and a pair of gloves. Taking a peek out side it looked like a barren snow land as usual and judging the attire some where wearing it suggested she'd probably want to wear something similar. Snow was climbing atop some sort of maze that stood in front of the monolith when suddenly it sank under her, quickly snow jumped to another one when it started sinking to.

Snow blew a strand of hair out of her face and groaned.<br>\r\n\t\"Why would you do that?\" Snow asked, retreating further down into the bra.<br>\r\n\t\"I have to put you somewhere.\" Kailey replied, shrugging. \"It's the warmest and least conspicuous place, too.

You being there could be kind of...distracting.\" Kailey tried to word it as best she could. She then pulled at her collar and lowered Snow in. \"This is probably a little less awkward for you too anyway.\" She said as she slipped the white-haired girl into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnow tumbled helplessly into the canyon of flesh. Firmly stuck waist-deep, she looked up to see a giant fingertip falling toward her. She raised her arms in a vain attempt to block it only to be pushed in even further. She was now completely engulfed up to her neck in warm skin. \"Oh yeah. This isn't awkward at all.\" She thought as she felt Kailey walking to the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the test, Kailey knew it was a good idea to move Snow. She could hardly feel the minuscule girl in her cleavage. Smiling to herself, she couldn't help but give her chest slight nudge with her arm, no doubt jostling Snow a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside, Snow was bored beyond belief. She could only move her head and other than the occasional minor movement of Kailey, it was painfully uneventful. Eventually, she began to consider Kailey's suggestion of a nap. \"Well, there's not much else I can do.\" She muttered, leaning her head against the massive breast on her right.

I was gonna go and visit some friends for a little while. Is that alright?\" Came a response from the giant girl.<br>\r\n\t\t\"Uh... Y-yeah... It's... It's fine.\" Snow answered apprehensively. A knot formed in her stomach. Meeting other giants... Could she trust Kailey to keep her safe?<br>\r\nTime came and went as Snow stayed in Kailey's bra, at a loss for anything else to do.<br>\r\n\t\"We're here~\" Kailey sang, carefully pulling Snow from her hiding spot. Snow's eyes widened as she looked around the gigantic and foreign bedroom. Her heart hammered in her chest and a chill crawled down her back as she eyed the other occupants of the room: two giant girls, presumably Kailey's friends. One of them, a perky blonde, looked absolutely ecstatic and stared intently at Snow. The other, a girl with choppy, blood-red hair, glared at Snow with eyes so dark they could have been black.<br>\r\n\t\"June...\" Kailey motioned towards the blonde, \"Mira...\" She made eye contact with the redhead, \"This is Snow.\"<br>\r\n\t\"Ohmygosh she's so... CUTE!\" June squealed, bouncing up and down. Snow shrank back in Kailey's grip. \"I've heard that they existed, but I've never seen any myself! Oh gosh she's just so adorable!\" Snow's face burned in embarrassment.<br>\r\n\t\"I've seen plenty.\" Mira interjected. \"Every time I saw one of those little pests I'd just...\" She crawled close to Snow until her face filled the tiny girl's field of vision, then took a hard, audible, deliberate swallow. \"They don't taste too bad, either. Heh.\"<br>\r\nTears ran down Snow's cheeks as she shook like a fragile leaf. For once since her time spent captured, she was grateful that Kailey's fingers enveloped her in a fist, hiding her from anyone.<br>\r\n\t\"K-Kailey... Kailey, please... Let's go home.\" Snow whimpered. \"I'm scared, Kailey. I'm really scared...\"<br>\r\n\t\"Mira!\" Kailey snapped. \"Snow is my pet. If you would like our friendship to continue, I'd appreciate if you didn't scare my dear little pet half to death or threaten her life! Understand?!\"<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah, Mira...\" June chimed in. \"How could you be such a bitch to something so sweet? That's sick. You're sick.\" Her demeanor had darkened a bit, visibly upset by her \"friend's\" remark.<br>\r\n\t\"Lay off you guys, it was just a joke.\" Mira grunted, settling onto the floor.<br>\r\n\t\"Kailey, please...\" Snow pleaded, \"I don't want to be here. Please...\"<br>\r\n\t\"Shhh...\" June whispered, \"If you two stay here, I promise Mira won't lay a hand on you, okay? I promise. Me and Kailey won't let it happen. Right, Kailey?\"<br>\r\n\t\"Right.\" Kailey confirmed. \"I would never let anyone hurt you, Snow.\"<br>\r\n\t\"Well...\" Snow mused. Though she was still a bit on edge, confirmation of no harm coming to her by not one but two giants was reassuring.

Static crackled in Snow's ears as the giant's harsh growl awakened something in her mind. She started to tremble, her brain abuzz with new memories. Still images flashed before her eyes, slowly forming a tangible story. A dirt covered dress, a locket, blood running down someone's leg. Bruises, pain, dogs snapping at her heels...<br>\r\n\t\"Snow?... Snow!\"<br>\r\n\tSnow hurriedly looked around in a daze. Everyone was staring at her.

It's over now.\" In truth, Snow was still chilled to the bone by her experience, but she figured she wouldn't give Kailey anything else to worry about until they got home and were in a relatively safe place.<br>\r\n\t\"I'm... I'm sorry, girls. I think it would be best if me and Snow went home... It's probably not a good idea to stick around after... that.\" Kailey cast her eyes to the ground and the other two girls nodded somberly.<br>\r\n\t\"W-wait.\" Snow interjected. \"I think... I really am feeling better. We can stay.\"<br>\r\n\t\"S-Snow, are you sure? Think about this for a second.

You quickly dried off, paying special attention to your large and weighty breasts, which \u2013 as usual \u2013 sent a little shiver down your spine. Though you were still somewhat damp, you dropped the soaked towel on the floor and sashayed out into your bedroom, where you found the bed empty but Vanessa awake and waiting for you as you expected. Her entire mountainous form was completely naked except for the glimmer of the jeweled choker nearly completely hidden in the bulge of fat that covered the space where her neck should have been. You saw how she just momentarily looked you over before averting her eyes, almost as she was embarrassed to see your naked form. You knew from experience that this was not the case; your dragoness could often be rather suggestive and even immodest at times, while the supposed shyness was just something she put on occasionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her luminous blue eyes still staring at a point several feet over your head, she cleared her throat before saying, \u201cI took the liberty of placing an order for breakfast once I saw you were awake, mistress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in understanding and lightly brushed your fingers across the almost-tribal markings some darker scales made on the outside of her thigh as well as reaching up with your other hand and roughly groping one of the massive mounds that were her breasts. Vanessa practically cooed in appreciation at your touch, a slight quiver passing through the ocean of flab covering her. You abruptly stopped and turned away from her, motioning towards your closet. It took several moments for the dragoness to recover, but she quickly hopped to it, and soon returned with a loose flowing blouse and a pair of sleek slacks, both cut and shaped to accentuate and flaunt your body. You looked over her choices and then rather than admit that you were satisfied with her selections, you instead held your arms out and Vanessa wordlessly started slipping the clothing on your body, her fingers still nimble despite their sausage-like appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that finished, she next grabbed a brush and set about working through your thick mane of blood red curls. Setting the brush aside, she reverently kneeled \u2013 her stomach pooling on the floor and her eyeline still above your own due to her height \u2013 as she slipped a necklace about your throat. She carefully adjusted the necklace, making sure that the emblem on the amulet was showing for all to see. After her hands dropped away, you held the amulet up to your eye, tracing a finger along the crest of your family, the Silverthornes \u2013 or as you all were more commonly called \u2013 the Royal Family. Letting the necklace fall loose again, you felt the little cool piece of metal settling into the canyon of your cleavage, and motion for Vanessa to stand up. She bowed her head as she struggled to her feet again, allowing you quite a bit of time to watch the waves of motion that passed back and forth through her immense frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than breathing heavily, she stood still once on her feet, and waited for your next command. Again, rather than saying anything, you merely gave a small \u201ccome along\u201d motion and turned away from your enormous dragoness and led her out of your bedroom and into the rest of your home.</span></div></div>",

He could surely get into the pants of any woman he wanted with just one look. Anna imagined how he would fear her, how he would scream, and beg, and cry...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Anna\u2019s hair hung around her face in greasy strands as her dull eyes took in the path before her. She gently squeezed the little thing in her fist, all of its will to fight taken from it. Her lip twitched, then grew into a wide grin. It was all hers. An innocent life in her hand. Hers to torture, to torment, to deny. He didn\u2019t know why she was doing this, or why he was the one to have such misfortune. But it was better that way. He didn\u2019t need to know. There was no reason such misfortune had befallen him, it was only chance. If she so wished it, the rest of his life could be nothing but misery and anguish, or could be comfort and peace of mind. It was all in her hands. Her devious smile grew wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan sat compliantly in his prison of flesh. He shivered, terror sinking into his bones. He wanted to throw up. How could this happen? He had been living a good life. Family, friends, a decent job, then all of a sudden he fell asleep and woke up to a living nightmare. He slammed his fist into the finger in front of him. The hand reacted, tightening its grip so he couldn\u2019t move a muscle. Dan whimpered. If he tried that again, the monster might very well be done with his antics and decide to just crush him to death. Her message was clear. \u201cDo not fuck with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His thoughts were shattered as he fell screaming from her palm, landing head over heels on some plush surface. Dan groaned as he struggled to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re home.\u201d Anna relayed the information with no fanfare. \u201cDo you know what that means?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cN-no\u2026\u201d Dan stammered nervously, shakily taking a few steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOn your hands and knees.\u201d She ordered. Dan neglected to comply. Everything was happening so fast, he could barely make sense of what was going on. \u201cOn your hands and knees!\u201d Anna growled, placing her index finger between Dan\u2019s shoulder blades and forcing him down roughly. \u201cGood boy.\u201d She purred, affectionately tousling his hair and stroking his back. \u201cPant. Like a dog.\u201d Dan\u2019s tongue lolled from his mouth. \u201cNow, we\u2019re gonna play a little game. Don\u2019t go anywhere~\u201d She left the room for a few minutes, trusting Dan was immobile on her bed. In a few minutes she returned, a jar of peanut butter in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWh-what\u2019s that for?\u201d Dan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell\u2026 You know how dogs like peanut butter?\u201d Anna smiled as she began to strip off her clothes. \u201cOh\u2026 and dogs don\u2019t talk.\u201d Dan\u2019s face burned in humiliation, but he didn\u2019t dare stop what she had ordered him to do. She unscrewed the lid of the jar and dipped her index finger into the creamy mass, pulling out a glob that on Dan\u2019s scale must have been at least two cup\u2019s worth. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day. I bet you\u2019re hungry. Aren\u2019t you?\u201d Dan bit his tongue and let out a bark and a whine, settling into a crouch on his haunches and giving his best puppy dog eyes to his captor. \u201cI suppose you are!\u201d Anna laughed at his humiliation. \u201cTell you what, I\u2019ll give you this food and let you go to sleep,\u201d She circled her left nipple with her clean left index finger, then dropped her hand down between her legs, \u201cBut I get to choose where you get to eat the peanut butter off of.\u201d A gleam of a wicked smile flashed on her lips.</span></div></div>",

Dan stared in awe at her sex. It could easily fit him inside of it, with no trace left behind. The scent emanating from in was not unpleasant, yet it was heavy, and thick, and everywhere. Anna began spreading the peanut butter at various thicknesses across her vagina. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to kill two birds with one stone. Not only will you get to eat tonight, but I\u2019ve taken the liberty to put it thicker on places you need to pay more attention to. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI understand.\u201d Dan replied, swallowing back his fear and slight disgust. He evaluated the anatomy in front of him, deciding to start at the vulva where it was thinnest, work his way to the labia, then finish with the clitoris. <i>Well, here goes everything\u2026</i> he thought as he knelt before her and stuck out his tongue. He tasted the light coating of peanut butter against her warm flesh. It wasn\u2019t as bad as he thought it was going to be. The woman above him moaned softly, Dan wasn\u2019t certain if this was an unconscious act or if she did it specifically to \u201cencourage\u201d him. He quickly finished up the vulva, his cheeks reddened from embarrassment. He continued with the labia. After a few mouthfuls he got something that tasted\u2026 different. <i>That\u2019s not peanut butter\u2026</i> he thought. After swallowing, he rubbed his tongue along the roof of his mouth and tried to figure out what it was. Salty, tangy, warm\u2026 Dan gagged a bit, trying not to throw up. It didn\u2019t even taste that bad, but the implications\u2026 Was she getting turned on by this? Dan resisted the urge to punch himself in the face for his stupidity. <i>Of course</i> she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy did you stop?\u201d the cold, accusatory tone cut through Dan\u2019s thoughts like steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2026 I-I\u2026\u201d Dan stammered. \u201cYou were\u2026 You were getting turned on and I\u2026 I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of eating\u2026 your cum\u2026\u201d he murmured sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell,\u201d she replied dismissively, \u201cYou\u2019d better get used to it. I don\u2019t keep useless things.\u201d Anna picked him up by his sides, holding the terrified flailing man in front of her mouth. \u201cSo if you don\u2019t eat me,\u201d her voice turned sinister and borderline demonic for someone of her appearance.\u201cI eat you.\u201d Dan screamed in horror as tears ran down his face. \u201c\u2018kay?\u201d she giggled, back to a lighthearted demeanor in a fraction of a second. Dan was terrified he\u2019d lose his mind while in her possession. She gently placed him on top of her pubic mound. The peanut butter was thickest on her clitoris. His hands shook as he tried to steady himself before diving face first into the sticky treat and lapping it up like his life depended on it. He couldn\u2019t stop now. He couldn\u2019t. One of the giant girl\u2019s fingers pressed down on his back, forcing his body to be slid along her clit with the rest of the gooey mess. Dan coughed and struggled as peanut butter filled his nose, throat, and eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i> Oh god, I\u2019m going to die. Choked to death by peanut butter\u2026 </i> Dan thought miserably. <i> I\u2019ll never see anyone ever again. </i> He thought of his mother and his father\u2019s smiling faces, his friends, that cute girl who stopped by his work just to see him\u2026 Dan cried. He sobbed bitterly, tears and snot dripping down his reddened face. He was only vaguely aware he was being lifted. Dan wiped the peanut butter from his face and stared the girl down with blurry eyes. \u201cWh-why--are---you---doing---this---to me?\u201d His lip quivered. \u201cPlease!\u201d He sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBecause.\u201d Anna responded clinically. \u201cYou\u2019re my toy to do whatever I want with. Nothing more.\u201d After a pause, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal, I just enjoy hurting you.\u201d She thought for a moment. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d She broke out into a smile which brought Dan no comfort \u201cMaybe it is personal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>Please\u2026</i>\u201d Dan begged in desperation. Anna drew a finger down his front and ignored his plea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUgh, you\u2019re all sticky. I can\u2019t play with you like this\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s time for a bath.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Dan was desperate to keep the girl from violating him any more than she already had. However, the involuntary cringe when he touched his stomach defied his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo you\u2019re not. Even if you were it wouldn\u2019t matter, because you\u2019re getting a bath either way.\u201d came her reply. Dan whimpered as he was gently encased in a fist, the giantess paying no mind to the smears of peanut butter across her palm. Anna swiftly carried the tiny man into the bathroom across the hall and unceremoniously dumped him onto the porcelain rim of the sink. She turned on the hot water faucet and waited for it to warm up. Dan was nervously looking for a way down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease let me go. I won\u2019t tell anyone, please\u2026\u201d He begged.

So, Dan\u2026 I encourage you to get used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWh- How did you know my-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was on the box.\u201d Anna replied casually, swirling her hand in the filled sink. He stayed silent. Dan didn\u2019t protest as he was plucked from his perch and submerged in the  inviting water. Anna squirted out some men\u2019s body wash on the rim of the sink for Dan to use. He accepted it gratefully, and immediately started washing his hair. No sense in defying her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cS-so, um\u2026. What\u2019s your name?\u201d asked Dan awkwardly. He wasn\u2019t sure why he wanted to know. It was unlikely she\u2019d allow him to address her by name, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy?\u201d Anna grit her teeth with the cold-blooded reply, her lips curling back into a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI-I-I just thought it would be nice\u2026 to know your\u2026 name\u2026.\u201d Dan stammered timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c...

When you\u2019re done with your bath, I did pick up some clothes for you to wear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cO-Oh\u2026 Uh\u2026 thanks.\u201d Dan mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHere you go.\u201d she held up two outfits. The first was fairly standard. Boxers, gray t-shirt, and track pants. The second\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA-are you sure?\u201d Dan whimpered as his cheeks reddened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOf course I am.\u201d Anna replied with a teasing grin. The second outfit was composed of frilly feminine panties, sheer white stockings with a matching garter belt, and a pink and white maid uniform. The skirt of the dress looked like it would just barely cover Dan\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease don\u2019t make me wear that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see when I\u2019m done with my shower. Oh! I almost forgot. I also have some cream you\u2019re going to use. It reeks like chemical warfare but it\u2019s so much more <i> thorough </i> than shaving.\u201d She eyed him up and down. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want to risk you cutting yourself either.\u201d That was only partially the truth. Anna had predicted that if she gave him a blade, Dan would not be above slitting his own throat as a way out. Even if he didn\u2019t actually have the balls to do it, it was better safe than sorry. Dan slowly rubbed his tensed body with soap as the giantess stepped into her shower.</span></div></div>",

But it was happening. Trapped in a nightmare and he couldn't wake up no matter how hard he tried. Maybe he had been slipped drugs? Maybe he had been smacked on the head too hard and this was all a fucked up dream as he lay dying and prone on the concrete. Dan sniffled, raising an open palm to his face in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"WAKE UP!\" he cried desperately, slapping himself. \"Come on, WAKE UP!\" He was heaving, his face a mess of snot and tears as he landed blow after blow on himself. \"IT'S NOT REAL! COME! ON! WAKE! UP!\" Blood began to trickle from his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the scenery stayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan curled into himself and focused on the raging water in the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nngh... Hah...\" Anna moaned, interrupting the shower's steady stream. Dan covered his ears. No way she was masturbating to what she had done to him. No way, no way, no way. But the sound was unmistakable, punctuated by the squishy pops of her fingers working inside her. \"Daniel... Ahh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"NO!\" Dan shouted as he slammed his fists against his temples and anxiously gripped his hair. \"NO! Stop, stop, stop, please, stop!\" he sobbed openly and swallowed back vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soaking wet body slid out from the shower. Sloppy wet footprints were left on the linoleum as Anna walked over to her prisoner. Dan grimaced, trying to push himself as far out of the water as he could. Her mouth abruptly curled into a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I'm sor-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No you're not.\" She answered quietly, rubbing her left thumb against his scruffy cheek. Anna sighed dreamily, curling her left hand to her chest. She slid her right hand closer to Dan, swaying her hips with a bashful smile. A slimy substance coated her index and middle fingers. \"Do you know what this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pungent aroma assaulted Dan's senses and he recognized it almost immediately. He recoiled and frantically tried to push her fingers away from him, even putting a foot into the effort. Anna broke into a demented smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my LOVE! It's my <i>love</i> for you! I was imagining you were inside me the whole time!\" She dipped her fingers into her mouth and sucked the fluid off, savoring her taste. Anna forcefully removed Dan from his bath and dried him off with a rag. She carried him off to her room, caressing and stroking him all the while. Dan was once again dumped on the mattress. He scrambled to his feet and desperately tried to make a run for it. \"No.\" Anna chided, as if scolding a child. She knocked him over effortlessly. Dan's heart hammered in his chest as he stared upwards in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wh-What're you going to do to me?\" he asked shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well darling, I just thought I should return the favor. It's only fair, after all.\" She responded with an uncharacteristic sweetness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Favor\", Dan thought wryly through his fear, as if he had willingly agreed to be kidnapped, tormented, violated, and have his entire body smashed against the sex of a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-Yeah?\" Dan asked through clenched teeth and a forced smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmhmm.\" She brushed her lower lip against his chest and giggled. Dan laughed as well, though his was out of nervousness. \"God, you smell amazing...\" she murmured, her thumb wandering down to his crotch. Dan stiffened immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, no, no, please no...\" Dan's facade cracked as quickly as he had put it on. \"I don't... I don't want it!\" Her facial expression remained serene as she gently caressed his cock. His traitorous body parts fell weak against her assault and his terrified brain wracked his nerves with pleasure. Dan wanted to throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you sure about that?\" Anna teased, smiling coyly and sliding a hot, moist lip along the comparatively tiny raging erection. \"Because this says otherwise...\" Her tongue darted out and lapped his crotch as she sighed airily, clearly enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes!\" He groaned as he frantically resisted his urge to orgasm. \"Yes, I'm sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come on. Just give in... You know your life will be easier if you do.\" she lilted, doubling her efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N... No...\" he swallowed, panting. \"Why sh-should I? Y-you t- you took everything from me!\" Dan bit his lip so hard it bled. Tears ran down his face as he suddenly turned into a bawling emotional wreck. \"My family, my friends, my <i>life</i>!\" He smiled wryly. \"And y-y'know what? Any life I'll h-have from this point on with you? It will b-be <i>shit</i>!\" Dan's own viciousness frightened him. He was normally kind and mild mannered at the worst of times, but these circumstances were not, in the loosest sense of the word, normal. \"So why don't you just F-FUCKING KILL ME?!\" Dan grit his teeth as he released his load into her mouth. Anna raised an eyebrow and Dan's bravado was gone in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No.\" She tapped Dan's chest thoughtfully as he mewled in terror. \"I'm not done with you yet, and you're clearly not as ready to die as you think you are.\" An incredulous look crossed her face. \"Also... What do you think I am? I'm not a total monster. I'm not like... A pet killer.\" Dan was speechless. She had just molested if not flat out raped him, and she had the audacity to call herself \"not a total monster\"? A gray t-shirt, black track pants, and a pair of boxers were haphazardly tossed in Dan's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Can I... put them on now?\" He asked, gripping the clothing like they might disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I mean, personally I'd rather you stay naked, but you do what you have to.\" Anna responded rather nonchalantly. Dan immediately fumbled his way into his clothes. He clenched his teeth and tensed, it seemed they were at a stalemate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what happens next?\" Dan's voice shook. He was certain she'd pierce him with needles and let him bleed out, or shove him inside her asshole for the things he had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I didn't plan this far.\" She admitted, sweeping him into her palm. \"But I guess I can improvise.\" Anna dumped him into the topmost drawer of her dresser. \"Had to find a good place to keep you, sweetie. Oh! And... here.\" She dropped a few scraps of notebook paper and a chunk of graphite next to him. \"To entertain yourself with until I get back.\" She left the drawer open a crack, to give Dan some light. Dan waited until he couldn't hear her footsteps anymore, then set on dragging together a few socks and a t-shirt to make a bed for himself. Wiping away a few stray tears that he didn't realize he was crying, he picked up the loose paper and lead, quietly regarding them before beginning to write, murmuring softly to himself,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Dan. I am 31 years old. I'm being held captive by a giant, I don't know where I am, but if anyone finds this...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan quickly scrawled out the last of his message, not entirely certain if this was to be a chronicle of his torture for his own sanity, or some warning to the next poor sap this demon would get her claws on. Maybe both? He gradually got up to explore his new surroundings. Despite the fact that it was still a cage and he was trapped here against his will, at least she was \"kind\" enough to give him such spacious living quarters. She could have chosen to force him to spend his nights in the cramped coffin-box he'd arrived in, if she had wanted to. Dan was grateful for that much, at least. An icy chord struck him in the chest. Oh god. Was this normal? Or was this the beginning of trauma bonding? \"She uses me as a sex slave whenever she wants, but at least she didn't tie me up in a tiny plastic prison every night, so there must be good in her!\" Dan shuddered. Would his mind... start to slip without him even noticing? The fragrance of laundry soap invited him as he approached a folded up pile of panties. Dan avoided them like the plague. No way in hell was he going to be anywhere near her vagina of his own volition. A wicked thought did cross his mind to take a shit in a pair and give that godzilla bitch the worst vaginal infection she'd ever seen. But he didn't. If he ended up as twisted as her, she'd win. He would keep his kindness. That would be his victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His vison suddenly went dark, his captor's gleaming eyes hanging above him. He stumbled backwards, nervous that he had somehow incriminated himself. He noticed she was no longer nude, instead opting to wear a tight black top that revealed her nearly flat chest. Shadows outlined the bones in her chest, making it look almost as if some enormous repulsive insect had made a home under her skin. <i>Fitting,</i> Dan thought, given how monstrous her actions had already made her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So I see you made a bed for yourself.\" She commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y... Yeah...?\" Dan answered tentatively. <i>This can't be good...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What if I gave you something better?\" She grabbed a thick pair of tights from the drawer and turned them inside out, revealing the fleece underside. She folded them a few times and placed them on top of t-shirt he was using. She slid a fluffy sock on top like a sleeping bag, or he could cover himself with the matching sock if he preferred. \"There. Try that.\" She gently placed him on top. Dan laid down and stifled a contented moan. It was like sleeping on a cloud. \"So how's it feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Like a dream...\" He responded drowsily. <i>Hang on...</i> his brain snapped to attention. <i>There has to be a catch...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good to hear it.\" She smiled, holding something balled up in her hand. \"I've got something else for you, too.\" She dropped it. <i>No...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the dirty panties she had been wearing just before she had made him eat peanut butter off her cunt and almost killed him in the process. Dan covered his nose and coughed. They were still moist with her \"love\", and its scent permeated every bit of clean oxygen Dan may have had in his sanctuary, robbing him of even that small bit of reprieve. Dan wanted to cry. Anna's eyes narrowed as her lips slowly curled into a grin. \"I'm glad you like it.\" Dan collapsed to his hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you want from me?\" His voice was shaking and his throat hurt, like he was about to start crying again. \"R-Ransom? I can pay ransom. I have plenty of money, just name your price.\" Cautious hope bubbled up in his eyes as she appeared to be mulling it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmm...\" She bit her lip and fiddled with her hair a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"One million?\" asked Dan without batting an eye. He really wasn't screwing around, he was willing to pay <i>any price</i> to be released from his hell. \"Two? I swear I won't tell anyone what happened if you let me go. If anybody asks where I've been, I'll make up a lie like I was off \"discovering\" myself or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No.\" She giggled, disturbing Dan to his core with her constant and consistent dissonant serenity, like his kidnapping and sexual torture was a game to her and he was a toy. \"You're more precious to me than <i>any</i> amount of money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"M-My parents... They'll come looking for me! They'll come looking when I'm not home! They'll call the police and you'll be found out!\" cried Dan in desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh Dan, don't be ridiculous.\" Anna smiled and casually waved the notion away. \"They won't find you even if they're looking, unless your parents were some sort of freaks who got you microchipped like a dog. And... If you think they're going to look through my underwear drawer for a person, well... You've got bigger problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What if...\" mumbled Dan, his brain balking at the idea he'd do something so cruel, \"What if I got you someone else?\" Anna's eyes widened in amused surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>You?</i> Someone like you'd really throw another poor soul under the bus to save yourself?\" She giggled in what Dan read as astonishment, \"Hah! Oh that's just fucking amazing. Wow.\" A slimy feeling spread through Dan's insides. His mind was still grappling with the fact he'd tried to barter another life for his own and he felt like the scum of the earth. \"Guess I rubbed off on you more than you like to believe.\" Anna spoke those words with the intention of driving a stake through Dan's heart. She succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N... No, I mean it. I really, really do.\" the sick feeling had spread to his head now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmm, well, I'll think about it.\" She responded, rubbing his cheek. Dan wished she'd stop touching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"R-really?\" Dan gasped in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hah! No! I'm silly, not stupid.\" Anna reached to shut the drawer while Dan became crestfallen. He should have known it was too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please, don't--- I don't want to be stuck in the dark!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It was a commendable effort, though.\" the whisper came on the final creak of wood as Dan's surroundings were shrouded in darkness. Dan crawled over to his new bed and buried himself as far as he could into the sock. He hoped he would die in his sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He rolled over to his right side and grunted in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sleep. It's not hard. Come on, sleep. Sleep, you fuckin' idiot, sleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He had no recollection of how long he had been lying there when he was so rudely jolted forward from the drawer being opened. Dan's heart sank. He wasn't certain if he'd fallen asleep at all. If he had, he couldn't recall any of it. Dan reluctantly crawled out of the sock. He knew if he didn't, she would take him out by force and not be particularly delicate about it. As he groggily gazed up in her direction, he tugged his shirt over his stomach, it having ridden up at some point during the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, sweetheart.\" She was unusually cheery, almost painfully so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh... H... Hi...\" Dan responded in confusion with a small wave. This was weird... Dan didn't put up a fight when Anna grasped him in her fist and lifted him out of the drawer, he knew better now. \"What are you going to do to me?\" Even after only a day, Dan caught on that she never picked him up without a purpose in mind. If she was holding him, something was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I just wanted to tell you I'm done with you.\" Her grin never strayed from her face. Dan wracked his brain trying to figure out what she meant, hopeful the vague statement meant he was going to be set free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you gonna let me go?\" cautiously asked Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nope!\" She replied with a small chuckle. \"Now, you can take off your clothes, or I can do it for you.\" Anna continued, sliding open a small pocket knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W...Wait, please, wait!\" Dan stammered in terror as the cold steel tip of the blade pierced his shirt and prodded his back. \"What <i>are</i> you gonna do to me?\" Last time he checked, being fucked by a sex-crazed lunatic wasn't exactly what he'd use to describe the word \"done\". <i>Maybe she intended to fuck him to death?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...\" tearing fabric punctuated her remark as Dan's shirt fell away in tatters, \"This whole thing really isn't working out. I mean, it's been fun, but...\" she pulled off his pants and boxers, despite Dan's resistance. \"And y'know obviously I can't let you go, so... I'm just gonna eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan would have sworn the sensation he felt was his lungs collapsing in on themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N... No...\" He whimpered in a small voice. \"No, you can't... y-you can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"\"You can't, you can't...\"\" Anna subtly mocked him with a spot-on imitation, right down to his Estuary accent. \"Well obviously that's not true because I am.\" She lifted Dan closer to her face. \"Aw, don't cry.\" She tenderly kissed the top of Dan's head, \"Everything's gotta end sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-is this because... Because I tried to fight you off? O-or i-is it b-because of what I s-s-said? B-because I-I'm sorry, I swear it, I really am! Th-this was a real funny joke!\" His mouth curled into an obviously terrified smile across tear stained cheeks, \"Really, <i>really</i> funny! B-but I-I've learned my l-lesson s-s-so please... Please... just p-put me back in the drawer and I-I'll fuck you whenever you want, yeah?\" He clenched his teeth and drew in a deeply shaken breath, \"I-I'll f-fuck you so good...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow.\" Anna grinned in amusement, \"Those self preservation instincts really kicked in, huh? But you're a bad liar...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-no! No, no, it's the truth!\" Dan shivered as she lifted him to her mouth. \"Please don't! PLEASE!\" He began frantically kicking Anna in the face. \"A-Anna...\" He used her name for the first time, \"<i>Please... Don't...</i>\" She ignored him, shoving his entire body in her mouth feet first before he could make a move to stop her. Dan wanted to reach out between her lips, but had he done so, his four fingers on his right hand would have been sheared clean off by her teeth. Dan screamed in agony as the wall of enamel shattered the bones of his left leg. White-hot bolts of pain speared him under his sternum in quick succession as his right leg was taken care of in much the same way. Now if he was going to try to choke her to death, it would be that much harder. Dan screamed as he was painfully contorted and quickly shoved headfirst into her tight, slimy, waiting throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The first thing Dan felt was indescribable terror, followed in rapid succession by the pounding in his chest and damp, cold clamminess of the sock around him. His shirt was plastered to his body with sweat. Dan took in a deep breath. It was just a nightmare. Just a dream. Though the same couldn't be said for the rest of his situation, he was still filled with relief. He was still here. Still alive. Giddy, breathless laughter left his mouth as his body quivered. Tears ran down his face as his laughter slowly turned into sobs. He clung to the fabric of the sock and wailed. He scrambled out of it, still sobbing when the drawer opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dan, I brought you some f--- Oh...\" she stared down at his red-faced heaving form. \"Geez, what happened?\" Dan stammered out something unintelligible. \"I... brought you some food? It's chicken and mashed potatoes.\" She gently set the doll-sized dish next to him, accidentally brushing against Dan in the process. He violently jerked away from her touch. \"Geez, you're soaked.\" She paused. \"How about we make a trade? If you give me your shirt I'll clean it up for you, and in exchange I'll give you this little coffee stirrer... thing... to use as a spoon.\" Dan sniffled as he peeled the sweat stained t-shirt from his body and handed it to her. Anna handed him the piece of plastic, a thin rod with a<br>\r\nminuscule flare out no larger than 1/8 inch. He picked it up and began to eat while she left to clean his shirt. When she returned, Dan had calmed down a bit. She gave him back his clothes. Dan quickly slid the soft, warm t-shirt over his head. He ate in silence for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Would you ever...\" Dan began, staring deep into his mashed potatoes, \"Would you ever eat me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's a weird question... but I guess not? Uh... I know I threatened to, but when it came down to it, I'd probably do something less... permanent. ...Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just a question.\" Dan looked up. \"Why are you being... So <i>nice</i> to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I said I wasn't a complete monster.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"... Ok.\" Dan pushed his plate away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What, no comeback?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm tired.\" Dan mumbled. \"My sleep wasn't the best.\" Anna sighed, taking the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright. I'll just come... get you in the morning, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...Ok.\" Dan hugged the sock he slept on tightly against himself and cried.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nightmares once again plagued him, though none severe enough to wake him from his unconscious state. He saw it so vividly. He was free, standing on the street of some nondescript city, but that was good enough for him. Somehow she had found him. She sat in front of him, legs spread wide. Her cunt was put on display for the entire gawking crowd in front of her and she knew it, sliding her fingers along her moist slit. Dan wanted to run but found himself glued to the spot. He watched in horror as screaming people were indiscriminately grabbed and stuffed into her glistening  lips, all while she was staring at him. Eyes wide and crazed, nearly bulging from her skull as she concentrated on Dan. Despite the small gratitude that she did not, he couldn't help but wonder why she didn't go after him, given that he wasn't exactly in a position to run. She squirmed a bit as they writhed inside her, no doubt causing hell for the people pinned beneath her feet. Her feet were dirty from the tarmac and stank with sweat from being stuffed in socks all day, creating a foul mixture that filled the air beneath her. Apparently, she had decided that anyone in the vicinity of her victim would be punished, given what an empathetic person Dan was. Dan felt a sharp prickle in his throat. This was because he refused to come quietly. It was all his fault. By this point, a small crowd had formed around him. Dan glanced around nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She keeps staring at him.\" a woman hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He must be the one she really wants.\" a man responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan panicked the second the crowd lurched forward as a rabid mob. Dozens of hands tore and clawed and grabbed at him. Even young children no older than five lunged for his legs and ankles in an attempt to take him down. A thin, pale hand grabbed his right wrist in a death grip. Another had gripped his left and they ripped Dan backwards. Two children clung to his legs, knocking him off balance as he tried to run. As he found himself falling, further still a set of hands gripped his neck, dragging him deep into the crowd. Feet kicked, fingers clawed, bruises formed on Dan's skin as he was battered and shoved forward by those who held him responsible for their suffering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He hit the asphalt hard. Blood seeped through his jeans from a skinned knee and Dan winced as he gently dusted the sand and pebbles from his torn palms. He happened to glance upward and immediately regretted it. Dan wished he could say nothing scared him anymore. But that would be a lie. Even sitting down she towered over him. Dan turned ghost white and shook uncontrollably as her eyes practically bored a hole in his skull. She smirked at Dan's nauseous disposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You could have prevented this you know.\" She said, smirk not wavering for a second. \"If I had you, I'd have no use for them. It's all your fault!\" Anna stated rather jovially, taking delight in Dan's visible wince. \"Well? What do you have to say for yourself, you fucking coward?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I... I-I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I-I-I...\" Anna mocked him with an exaggerated stammer. She rose to her feet, callously crushing the people trapped beneath them. Dan swallowed hard and his pulse rose when she twisted her feet, pulping them to nothing more than sticky reddish gunk between her toes. <i>That could have been him...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay!\" Dan shouted in overwhelmed defeat. \"If I come with you, will you leave them alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mhm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So... What?\" Dan shifted nervously from foot to foot. \"Are you going to kill me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No... They are.\" Dan turned immediately on his heels to meet dozens of furious stares. He was frozen to the spot in terror, even as they rushed him with the intent to tear him to shreds. First one hand grabbed him. Then another. His jeans were torn open. His ankle snapped with a sickening crunch as someone stomped on it to take him down. Individual hands grasped all ten of his fingers and broke each and every one with a pain that paralyzed his arms. Long nails dug into his chest, ripping apart flesh. Teeth bore into his shoulder as he sank to his knees. When Dan opened his mouth to let out an anguished howl, fingers from what must have been dozens of strangers wormed their way into his mouth, tangling and tugging harshly at his jaw like they wanted to unhinge it. Ribs snapped as feet were driven into his sides with the intention to kill. He gazed tearfully at the gloating face of the one who had spurred the horde on. Pain surged in his face as it was kicked and stomped. Color flashed in his eyes as someone rammed their toes into the side of his head. The unwelcome taste of iron collected in his throat. Tendrils of black darkened his vision as Dan mercifully began to pass out. Their frenzied assault grew fainter on his registry as he gurgled on his own blood. After so many torturous minutes, Dan's consciousness was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He awoke startled, but nowhere near in the state of terror he had been in with the last dream. The drawer was open, light bearing down on him, his captor nowhere to be seen. Dan sat up and shivered, wrapping the sock around his curled up body. Howling wind beat against the window with a raging blizzard. There was no hope for escape now, unless Dan was content with freezing to death. How long had he been out? The light seemed natural enough. It must be morning. Dan's stomach growled, his first nightmare had eradicated any appetite he'd had at the time, so he barely ate the food he'd been given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ugh...\" he moaned, holding his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey!\" Anna beamed while Dan fell backwards in surprise. \"Aw, did I scare you?\" Dan stared up, deep blue eyes wide with shock. \"I guess that's a yes.\" Dan's stomach let out another growl. \"Are you hungry?\" Dan pulled himself back up and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I hardly ate anything last night. I was too scared from my dream...\" The vestiges of both nightmares clawed at his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good, because I already made food.\" Anna gently handed him something, \"I made this for you.\" Dan held it close. It was a real, actual spoon, crafted from a piece of wood. It was a bit crude, but given the size difference between them, Dan thought it was damn impressive that she pulled it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I... <i>love it</i>.\" Dan murmured as he turned it over in his hands and admired its glossy varnish. A dish clattered beside him, breaking him from his trance. Scrambled eggs and toast with strawberry jam sat on the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Careful, it's hot.\" She warned as Dan eagerly dug into his breakfast. After a few bites, Dan stopped. <i>Something bad must be on the horizon... That's always how it goes. She gave him gifts or food then BAM! something sex related happened, when sex was the last thing he wanted.</i> He put the spoon down in a deliberate motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What're you planning?\" Dan's brow crinkled into a serious expression as he pried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Me?\" Anna gasped like she couldn't believe what he was implying, though they both knew it was a lie. \"Nothing! I don't have anything--why would you even ask that?\" she smirked. \"Not like I'd tell you, anyway.\" She turned. \"But...\" a modified pair of panties was held up, with eight vertical incisions in the crotch area arranged in parallel sets of two, sewn to resemble buttonholes, four on top, four on the bottom, creating four strap-like strips of cloth. \"See those?\" She pointed, \"Your arms and legs go against each of those straps, then I thread a piece of string or--ooh, I bet some ribbon would look nice!--through these slits here, and fasten each in the back with a bow. Then, you're my little panty slut, with no chance of escape! Isn't it great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I... I uh...\" Dan stammered, his horrified expression speaking volumes before he quickly shoveled another spoonful of scrambled egg into his mouth to shut himself up. He swallowed the mouthful without chewing, \"Yeah, great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Liar.\" the curt accusation lowered the temperature by ten degrees. A chill ran up Dan's spine. He quickly took another bite of eggs in an attempt to warm himself up, paying no mind to the burns it left in his mouth. Anger quietly consumed him, shoving aside his rightful caution and fear when dealing with <i>her</i>. Without any time to process who he was speaking to, Dan blurted out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well <i>excuse me</i> for not wanting to be slammed up against your cunt all day! You know, <i>some people</i> think about something other than sex 24/7! Don't you have any fucking hobbies?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure I do!\" smiled Anna as though Dan hadn't just insulted her to her face. \"Knitting, sewing...\" Her finger barreled towards Dan, knocking the wind out of him and pinning him to the floor, \"...Torture.\" Her Midwestern accent almost made it sound like a deceptively pleasant thing. Dan's widened eyes stared at the finger on his heaving chest, anticipating the pain of a crushed sternum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"P-Please... D-Don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now...\" Anna continued, \"If you don't want me to involve you in that hobby, I'd suggest you start keeping in mind who exactly you're talking to.\" Dan nodded meekly as she retracted her finger and let him up. \"Good. Now that that's out of the way...\" Anna dangled a roll of red satin ribbon in front of Dan, \"I think this'll do nicely for bondage, don't you? And of course you'll need a gag, too. I mean, I'd love to make you taste me again, but I can't go and have people hear you screaming when we're out. Oh! That's right!\" She reached behind Dan, pulling out a pair of socks, \"If you don't want to be \"slammed up against my cunt all day\" as you so bluntly put it, I could just wear you in my fucking socks. The best part? You don't get a say. You're going wherever I put you. That'll teach you to mess with me!\" Her eyes wandered between the ribbon and the socks. \"How's a girl to choose?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dan graciously took this time to continue his journal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can't recall my kidnapping itself, however, I was stripped naked and all my possessions on my person were confiscated, presumably to make sure I didn't have a phone to call for help with. I woke up after an indeterminate amount of time spent unconscious. I was trapped in a box which at that point was in her possession. On the first day, I was forced to eat peanut butter off her vagina. When she got turned on and I refused to eat the peanut butter/fluid out of disgust and embarrassment, she threatened to eat me, then nearly smothered me to death in an attempt to get herself off. After I was bathed, she decided she was going to molest me. For some reason she didn't kill me even though I gave her adequate cause. I've had more than one nightmare in my current two days here. She feeds me well and on a consistent basis, and from what I can tell it doesn't seem to be drugged.\" He paused, deep in thought. \"If I didn't know any better, I'd say the lines of being captive are already beginning to blur. It terrifies me to no end...\" Dan stopped, looking up at his captor and shuddering slightly knowing what was to come. She was humming a Christmas carol to herself, and Dan found himself absentmindedly humming it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm ready for you.\" She purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why do you do this...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Be more specific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wh... Why do you fucking <i>torture</i> me, then give me nice things like that will make up for it? Because it doesn't. Not even <i>fucking</i> close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because you're cute!\" she giggled. \"You're my little boyfriend fuck toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I'm... your... boy... friend...?\" Dan's face twisted in bewilderment while she grasped him and lifted him from his \"home\". <i>I didn't agree to this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah!\" She confirmed. \"So... I've been thinking... I know it's only been a day or two, but it must get lonely in there at night. I was thinking maybe I should get you a friend. A girl? Or a boy, whichever you'd be more into. Maybe having someone there will cut down on the nightmares.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Not being fucking tortured would cut down on the nightmares, too...</i> Dan thought sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan's stomach twisted into a knot and his heart may have well weighed a hundred pounds. No way was he about to condemn some other poor person to suffer with him, definitely not, as the slimy echo of his offer to get her \"another person\" gripped his emotions....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-No!\" he said in a rush. \"I-It's just that I... don't... want to share you?\" Dan responded unconvincingly with a lopsided desperate smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh darling, that's so romantic!\" She gushed. Dan's brow crinkled into disturbed puzzlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wh...\" He clenched his teeth and went with it. \"... Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'd get jealous, to be honest with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan's vision blurred as he distinctly heard an imaginary  male and female scream, warped into one, abruptly cut off by a bone rending crunch and the messy tearing of flesh. The squishy chewing noise of raw meat and crackling of marrow while his \"girlfriend\" feasted on his potential roommate, effectively removing the competition for Dan's \"love\", nauseated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-Yeah...\" Dan mumbled, a bit green in the face. He'd take miserable loneliness over shared suffering any day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So... Anyway... I guess it's time to get started! My getting you was a bit of a spur-of-the-moment thing, so I have to get some more stuff if I want to keep you well.\" Anna stroked his head, slightly messing up his quiff. She started stripping him, gently placing his clothes in the drawer on his \"bed\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"C-Couldn't I just... Stay here...? Please? I-If you think I'd try to escape, I wouldn't, I swear! The drawer's sides are like, 20 feet high, at least! And-And even if I did somehow manage to get to the top of it, the dresser's almost as tall as you, right?\" He glanced over to the object in question, confirming the statement. \"That's nearly a 150 foot drop! If I tried to jump from that, I'd die! I'd definitely die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But what if you wanna die?\" came Anna's sage reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"H... Huh?\" Dan swallowed nervously, not quite sure what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe you want to be left alone here so you have an opportunity to kill yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"B... But I don't! I don't want to die! I just--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We're done talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-Wait, I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Daniel.\" Her sharp tone made Dan shut up real quick. Were they the same size, he never would have thought someone ten years his junior who would easily pass for pubescent in overall appearance could sound anything close to authoritative, but now? God may have well just come down from heaven and slapped him silly. \"Now that we're done with that, are you going to come willingly, or am I going to have to tie you down by force?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I won't fight you.\" Dan whispered as he looked defeated. Broken, almost. She gently placed him in her panties and noticed he had gone almost completely limp, allowing her to bind his arms and legs easily. Anna even attempted to tie a decorative ribbon harness across his torso for the hell of it, to accentuate his body. She tied him down tight enough that even if he pulled at the ribbons with all his might, he couldn't escape. Her nimble fingers deftly fastened a bit of ribbon in his mouth behind his head. Anna briefly considered blindfolding him too, but as she anchored her panties just beneath her slim thighs, she looked down to see his wide blue puppy dog eyes begging for mercy and decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You look adorable!\" she crooned, gazing lustfully at him. \"Wrapped up nice and tight like a little Christmas present!\" The red ribbon complimented the medium pink of her panties perfectly, she thought, accentuated even further by Dan's sexy squirming body. She started getting wet and wanted--no, <i>needed</i>-- Dan between the folds of her labia. Without any fanfare, and ignoring Dan's muffled cries for her to \"please stop\", she abruptly slid her panties up and allowed the waistband of her bikini-cut underwear to settle on her hipbones. She stroked his writhing form from outside her panties, confident he was now buried in the moist folds of her labia. She put a pair of leggings on under her jeans to keep her--and him--warm, jeans weren't the most insulative material and she highly doubted her body heat alone would be enough to keep Dan from freezing, with him being naked and all. She stroked his body one last time through her jeans, and felt him shudder at her touch. She guessed he was probably crying right now. She couldn't blame him or call him a crybaby for it, really, it would be a fucked up situation for anyone to adjust to. Enough dawdling, though. Anna slid on her jacket. She had to go to the store to get some supplies for her new tiny pet man, but she also wanted to go to the library just to have some \"personal\" time with her little trapped boyfriend. She'd definitely find time to do both, she decided, she just had to choose where to go first.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan strained to free himself even though he knew it was useless. As a matter of fact, such an action was counterproductive. His squirming only stimulated her, causing his surroundings to become even warmer than before. The scent of her arousal clouded his senses. It actually made him a bit euphoric from the lack of oxygen in complete dissonance to the terror he should (and was, on a lessened scale) be feeling given his current location. His brain seemed to have forced itself into a bizarre state of denial. Dan began to grow a bit drowsy from the gentle swaying of her hips, despite the cacophony of pounding footsteps on pavement and roaring car engines outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan wondered what being her \"little boyfriend fuck toy\" entailed for him in the grander scheme of things, could he not escape. Though the thought of manipulating someone left a bad taste in his mouth, he <i>was</i> currently the prisoner of a monster, so was manipulating her for his own gain such a bad thing? Maybe he could have her move his \"home\" to the bottom drawer so if he managed to scale it, it wouldn't be lethal. Maybe he could ask her to buy a dollhouse for him to live in, hope she put it close to the floor, then bolt while she was asleep. Even if he couldn't escape, maybe he could pull the strings of this crazy bitch to live a fairly normal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She seemed totally enamored with him. It was more than a bit frightening, honestly. So obsessed yet so willing to torture him for fun... Dan wondered, would he be treated better if he put up a facade that he loved her? Probably not. She seemed to love to watch him squirm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan wondered why she gagged him from screaming. Did other giants know he existed? Would they have helped him if they could have heard him? Dan bitterly doubted it. If <i>he</i> encountered a two inch humanoid in a world where they were apparently very common, he'd likely treat them with apathy at best. No disillusion there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Christmas carols that had undoubtedly grown ear grating and obnoxious blared on the loudspeakers outside his panty prison. Dan picked through now bittersweet memories of Christmases past, that he would likely never experience again. <i>His parents... His sister... All setting up the tree together and laughing and smiling... Talking about how their lives were going...</i> Even if escape was possible, the time of year would be left permanently stained with the time he met one of the most horrific creatures he had ever seen. Some would wonder how he had managed to give up hope of escape so quickly and let his spirit be crushed so soon, only two days into captivity (That he knew of, his time in the box was undetermined). Her reign was absolute. She made certain escape was, if even possible, a very risky maneuver with an absurdly high mortality rate. She certainly wasn't stupid or careless when it came to tinies. Dan was no fool either, he wasn't about to risk being crippled and found. After that, she'd either torture him to death or use it as an opportunity to enforce her control. Whether he ended up paraplegic or quadriplegic, he'd end up even more pathetic than he already was in her eyes. Like a baby, helpless and vulnerable. He'd rely on her for absolutely everything. He wasn't willing to risk that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Viscous fluid coated his body as he futilely struggled. His wrists and ankles began to burn as his tight bonds rubbed his skin sore. Dan had one reprieve, though. Being this obviously in public for her meant she couldn't push him further into her lips without running the risk of being caught. But he was wrong. Suddenly her thumbs anchored around  the waistband of her jeans, yanking them up until he was once again trapped against her body. Dan choked down breath after muggy breath of tainted air as he finally broke down into tears. She slowly ground against him, apparently having slammed herself against a shelf to subtly reposition him. Dan was honestly surprised she hadn't broken his spine by accident with her reckless abandon. Fluid rushed out, covering his face as he let loose a muffled scream. It slowly filled the back of his sinuses. Dan was drowning in cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Anna milled about the aisles, picking through clothes and necessities specially designed for tinies. Boxers, jeans, t-shirts, button-up shirts, hoodies, sweaters, a couple pairs of socks, and canvas shoes. Check. Dishes, she already had. A set of silverware, minus any sharp knives. A toothbrush, an electric razor. She briefly considered buying some shower essentials but decided against it. His baths in the sink would be an intimate little bonding experience with him, whether he liked it or not. She felt Dan quiver in her panties. Anna collected his new belongings to purchase them. She needed to get to the library for some private time before she became so pent up she accidentally fucked him to death or drowned him in her cum. Maybe she should get him some hard liquor to take the edge off in the future. Looking around to make sure no one was watching, she gently stroked Dan through her jeans and decided she would bake a cupcake especially for him tonight as a reward.</span></div></div>",

Any \"private time\" she needed could just as easily be pulled off in her room. There was less of a chance of being interrupted that way, too. The door slammed behind her and she raced upstairs, indifferent to how Dan may be affected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey cutie...\" She giggled at his half-conscious form as she peeled her outerwear and panties down to release him from his prison.

She placed him on her night table, handing him a cloth to wipe her fluids off of himself. Sure he'd reek like her until his next bath, but it was better than being soaking wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Anna left him stranded and alone for awhile, doing who knows what. Dan had an inkling that prying into it would only lead to bad things. He got an idea as to what she was doing when the scent of chocolate floated up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan felt a familiar pang of discomfort in his lower abdomen as she walked through the door. He bashfully rubbed his knees together and felt blood rising to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"U-Um...\" Dan stared at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes?\" Anna responded with a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"U-Uh... I-I... I need... I need to use the toilet.\" Dan mumbled in embarrassment. \"I-If you could maybe take me outside, I know it's cold and everything, but... That'd work. Uh... If you have y'know... a bottlecap or something, I could use that, too...\" Dan was trying to think of the least embarrassing ways to relieve himself. He looked up. Anna was tapping her bottom lip in groups of three. Tap. Tap. Tap. Not like she was punctuating a train of thought, but rather like she was suggesting something. Dan's eyebrows furrowed in confusion. \"Ah... S-Surely you don't mean?... I-I mean, that's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wh... N-No... No, w-we can't, i-it's... th... that's... a-and you...\" stammered Dan in horrified revulsion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come on. Are you tellin' me --in all the time you've been here-- you've not once daydreamed about shitting in my mouth as revenge?\" She smiled like it was a completely normal endeavor, totally unfazed by the prospect of having him shit in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-Well... I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"See? So do it already.\" She opened he mouth and dangled Dan above it, waiting. A small part of Dan was overjoyed, in a twisted way, that she cared about his comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"U-Um... Okay...\" Dan squirmed in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This close enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y... Yeah...\" Dan quickly let loose a stream of piss into her mouth before he lost his nerve. She swallowed like it was nothing. \"Mm... A... Are you really sure... this is okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well duh.\" she chided. \"It'll be like taking a pill--not even that. So I'm not gonna have trouble swallowing if that's what you're getting at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"O-Oh. Okay...\" He mumbled as he clenched his muscles, trying to get it over with as fast as possible. Strange that the one most embarrassed was the one using another person's mouth as a toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She swallowed as soon as it fell into her mouth, tasting nothing save for a slight bitterness. He sighed in relief and she smiled, glad she was able to help her little toy out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Done?\" She asked, handing him a square of toilet paper and setting him down. \"You can just chuck it in my mouth, I guess. Look, I know it sounds gross, but... Dude I just swallowed your shit, so...\" She retrieved his clothes from the dresser and let him get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh... Y-Yeah.\" He finished up and did as she instructed. The awkwardness refused to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So anyways, I bought you some more clothes and stuff.\" She held up a small plastic bag and started laying out items in front of him. Dan's stomach turned. Were people kidnapped on a wide enough scale to justify selling these things? \"Are they okay?\" He remained transfixed in horror. \"Yes?... No?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh?!\" Dan blurted out in surprise. \"Y... Yeah, they're fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"D... Do you think... I could maybe... Call my parents?\" He loosened up a bit. \"Please? I have no idea how long I've been gone, and... they must be worried sick! I... I just want to tell them I'm okay. I won't say anything else.\" A small, nearly undetectable twitch rippled through her neck. The action chilled Dan to his bones as he stumbled back a few steps, certain it was either a sign of rage or madness. Neither was good for him. Anna scoffed derisively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How fucking <i>stupid</i> do you think I am? First it's one phone call, then the next thing I know, people are trying to mow me down with rocket launchers and machine guns. So no.\" Dan couldn't blame her for her reluctance. Tears ran down his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I know. I know. I just...\" He started to ramble a mile a minute, \"How did I get here?! Who brought me here?! Why was I chosen?!\" He crumpled to the ground. \"Why me?\" Dan knocked his head against the desk despondently. \"Why me? Why me? Why me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She slid down the stairs while Dan was distracted by wallowing in rightfully earned self-pity. The sliding of paper against wood was the only thing that broke him from his curled up trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?...\" He mumbled quietly as he rolled over. Not the best thing to say to someone who could easily shove him back in her panties and just forget about him, but at this point he was too drained, physically and emotionally, to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I got something else for you, too!\" She smiled, peeling off the paper wrapper. Dan's jaw dropped. Lying in front of him was a massive chocolate cupcake, topped with glossy pink icing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"F... For me?\" Dan was staring in elation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yep!\" Dan bolted upright, wasting no time taking a handful of cake. He bit into it, sugary cherry frosting and chocolate somehow negating his worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmph... So good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Weak.</i> His brain hissed at him through crackling static of half-formed thoughts. <i>Tortured all day and all night and held captive, never going to see your family again, and an iced sugar treat is all it takes to make up for it? You make me sick.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan crammed another bite of cake into his mouth and tried to let the cloying sweetness overtake his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>So are you just gonna fall in line with her orders? Huh? Have you reduced  yourself to being a fucking pet that quickly? Pathetic. Disgusting. No wonder no one's come to rescue you yet. Because you're a waste. They probably don't even notice you're gone... And if they did, \"good riddance\", right? They don't miss you. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"SHUT UP!\" He screamed. \"Shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up SHUT UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"... You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah...\" he swallowed. \"F-Fine...\" Dan screamed louder than he ever had, as he was abruptly pulled into the air. He was now pressed against the bones in her chest. He was suddenly in full panic mode. His throat burned like he had swallowed a handful of needles. Dan panted anxiously, his eyes frantically looking for an escape route. \"Let go of me! LET ME GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Why are my emotions going crazy?...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She complied, briskly putting him back in the drawer where he belonged, moderately panicked by his outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright.\" Anna responded, a bit flustered. \"I'm gonna let you calm down a little bit. \"I'll come get you for a bath in a couple minutes, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan decided something right then and there between erratic beats of his heart. He would find out how he got here. He'd try to escape, to go home. If he didn't, he'd without a doubt lose his mind. He would run for his life or die trying.</span></div></div>",

A pink t-shirt covered her torso, the brownish nubs of her nipples plainly visible through its thin material.  Her fingers worked inside her, panties pushed to the side. She was deep in her favorite fantasy. She imagined Dan's body draped above her, the height of a normal human being. His hands were wrapped around her neck, attempting to squeeze the air out of her. Anna couldn't tell if the look on his face was rage or some sort of vengeful triumph. Her taunting smirk only made him squeeze harder in anger. He could kill her, but he wouldn't. No, the sex was too good. Dan was on top, balls deep inside her as he strangled her half to death. It made the contractions of her cunt that much tighter around his cock. The fucking crazy bitch even had the audacity to smile smugly, even though he had her pinned, fucking her brains out, and threatening to kill her. It was so uncharacteristic of him, his personality had done a complete 180. Soft-spoken, kind, with occasional bouts of energy. She had corrupted him, he concluded. She had twisted him into a gross mockery of who he used to be. He squeezed her throat and his lips parted into a demented teeth baring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know what bitch?!\" He growled in exuberance.  \"You know fucking what?!\" He leaned into her ear and whispered, \"I wanna kill you. I wanna kill you so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The--...-n....D-....It....\" She struggled through a half-closed trachea, challenging him. He squeezed harder. Harder. Harder still. Her jaw loosened. Her eyelids drooped over rolled-back eyes. Her fingers weakly flexed against the bed. Dan let go immediately. He wasn't a murderer. She took in a deep, coughing breath. His hands still gripping her throat, he murmured over and over to himself in some feeble self confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not a murderer... I'm not... I'm not a murderer... I'm not a murderer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...Hah... Ha...\" Dan looked down in surprise. Even now, she laughed at him. \"Y-You... Don't even have... the balls!\" She smiled as if he hadn't nearly just choked her to death. \"Ha... Ha!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He gripped her bony shoulders and rammed her harder, cutting her off from the surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm still fucking you, though!\" He pulled out of her, prodding her asshole with the tip of his penis. \"How does it feel to be used? Helpless? Not good, right?\" He smiled sarcastically, thinking back to all the torture he'd endured. \"How does it feel?\" Dan slapped her hard in the face. \"HOW DOES IT FEEL?!\" He smacked her again with the back of his hand, knuckles hitting her cheekbones full force. \"HOW DOES IT FEEL?!\" He demanded of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nngh... <i>Amazing...</i>\" She slurred, just to piss him off. \"If this is what it felt like, I can't believe you resisted me... But I'm not weak. Not like you.\" Dan's cheeks burned and he forced his way into her backdoor without a second's hesitation. Luckily, her fluids had dripped down to add lubrication so the abrupt motion would cause her pain. but not leave tears or any permanent damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How about now? I'm gonna ruin your hole. I'm gonna fuck you so hard it won't close for a week, leaking spunk everywhere you go, and there's not a damn thing you can do about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ahn... Y-You really think giving me a good time's supposed to make me feel sorry for you? Man you really are screwed up!\" She laughed, and laughed, and laughed. \"But I wouldn't expect anything less from you, you fuckin'-- Gh--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't give her time to finish, inserting the rest of his length into her until her stretched anus was wrapped around the base of his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fuck you feel so good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I sure fuckin' hope so...\" She rocked her hips, stroking him with her insides. Dan groaned and reciprocated the action. \"Nnh... N-No matter what you think you can do as revenge... No matter what you think... is gonna hurt me... I'll <i>love</i> it.\" She looked more than a bit deranged, teeth showing through a thin, cracked lip smile. \"Y'know whyyy?\" She brushed his cheek tenderly, her eyes giving a look of compassion while her lower lip pouted slightly. \"Because I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan stared back, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well you've got a pretty fucking funny way of showing it.\" He pounded her fast and hard, determined to wipe that infuriating grin off her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ahahahahaha!\" Anna giggled. \"Are you trying to take your \"revenge\" on me now?! Huh?!\" She let out a cute high-pitched moan. \"Ghh... you fuck me so good when you're angry! Fuck me more! <i>Please,</i> fuck me more! <i>More!</i>\" She begged, nearly wailing from how badly she wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back in reality, her chest tightened. Her fingers were anchored knuckle-deep inside herself, and her thumb pushed hard on her clit. She came thinking of <i>him</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan sat on his bed with his head buried in his knees. He could hear her screams of lust from outside, calling out his name, needing him, pleading for him, begging for him. Dan expected to be snatched up and used as a dildo any second now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To his relief, it didn't happen. But it would. Rest assured, it would. Dan scooted into a far corner. He'd use this respite to recover his memory. No matter how disjointed, no matter how full of holes, any memory would be better than none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sights, sounds, colors, smells, sensations, <i>think</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Cold. He had been cold.</i> His house had a draft that he neglected to fix. He had been sitting in a dimly lit room, curled up under a blanket. Some superficial social media account was pulled up on the laptop in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Smells. Think.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wisps of smoke accompanied the smell of a half-smoked stubbed out cigarette sitting in the black plastic ashtray on the coffee table. <i>He only smoked when he was stressed. Why would he be stressed?</i>. Something heavy, too. Hard liquor? Yes, that was it! Dan clumsily grasped the heavy glass in his hand. He was already buzzed, having previously finished a shot or two to calm his nerves.<br>\r\nA familiar bitterness washed over his tongue. Familiar, yet different. It had been... Deeper. More encompassing. <i>Wrong.</i> There had been something else slipped in the drink, but at that point Dan was too drunk to notice or to care. <i>Stupid, stupid, stupid!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In the present, the hairs on the back of Dan's neck stood up. Someone planned that. Every bit. Someone saw him and drugged him for human trafficking. And he had played right into their hands. Everything considered, Dan considered himself lucky to not be dead from respiratory depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan finished the drink, paying little mind to his warped vision and lightheadedness. He should have been panicking, drunk or not, but somehow his brain felt placid to an absurd degree. Exhaustion, impossible to fight, came over him and his eyes closed of their own will...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He moaned quietly in frustration, slumping to the soft clothing ground as memories trickled back to him. It was all his fault. If he hadn't drank that night... If he had just noticed something wrong with the drink...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan suddenly wished he could stop recovering his memories.</span></div></div>",

He reflexively closed his eyes, trying to give his retinas an adjustment period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I said, are you awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gh... Kh...\" He pushed himself into a sitting posiiton, still blind. The icy cold of the tile had been too much to bear. \"What... happened? ...Where am I?\" Dan's mouth felt sticky, like he had slept with it open. The formation of words felt clunky and foreign on his tongue. He warily opened his eyes. What he saw terrified him to tears. He wasn't on a tiled floor as he first thought, but rather a countertop. He was flanked on either side by well-built men who appeared to be some sort of security guards. Most horrific of all, the owner of the voice hung above, a giant so large its face looked as if it belonged on a billboard. Its savage almost-black eyes were trained on Dan. Dan screamed in pants-pissing terror. Adrenaline spiked. This wasn't real. This wasn't real, this wasn't <i>real</i>. He turned in an attempt to distance himself from the monster and came face-to-face with a crackling blue arc of electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wouldn't do that if I were you.\" the giant warned, running a hand through his graying hair, as Dan whimpered and the guard put down the stun gun. \"I think you should sit here and listen to what I have to say, okay? It'll be easier if you do. Mmm, you're a cute one. I imagine you won't last long.\" the giant man rubbed Dan's chest and gently pinched his arms and legs, getting a feel for Dan's body. Dan's skin went ice-cold, a sharp contrast to the sizzling hot tears running down his cheeks. If this giant didn't flat-out kill him, Dan was certain the poison panic that was closing his throat and throwing his heart against his ribcage would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wha... What the fu--...\" Dan stammered, not even coherent enough to get the full sentiment out. \"What the <i>fuck</i>... What the fuck <i>is</i> this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Allow me to explain.\" the giant continued calmly, as though he had done so thousands of times before. \"You, and everyone you know are... \"artificial lifeforms\", so to speak.\" He quietly kept his gaze on the tiny man in front of him, gauging reactions. \"That is to say, who knows how long ago, we created... homunculi.\" He paused, seeing Dan's confused thousand-yard stare.\"Uh, little humanoids grown in test tubes. The thing was, nobody knew what to do with them, or if they should have any sorts of rights. Which rights? Human rights, because they were sapient? Animal rights? No. The ultimate ruling was they were things. Artificial constructs created using a human's blueprints. Most of them stayed put, in the labs where they were created. Some managed to slip through the cracks, though, and lived pathetic lives as scavengers. Their only benefit was that they were <i>explosive</i> breeders.\" Dan was transfixed by the story in a horrific fashion. It couldn't be true. No. It had to be some kind of fucked up mind-game. The giant folded his hands. \"So I'll bet you're wondering what this all has to do with you. Well...\" He leaned in, causing Dan to scoot back in terror, \"We wondered, just out of curiosity, what you would be like if you thought you were truly human. So, we made cities. Isolated. Covertly monitored. And we watched. And you know what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wh... What?\" Dan squeaked. He quickly glanced at one of the guards, and dredged a thick, barely audible statement from the back of his throat that he hoped the giant didn't overhear. \"Help me. Please... Help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It turned out you were more human than we thought. Of course that didn't change anything, but it was interesting nonetheless. So... Anyway, this one guy gets an idea. People are already picking up the rogue ones off the street to keep as pets or use as fucking snake food or whatever, and nobody really complains because like I said, they're explosive breeders. He said, \"What if we harvested some of the special breed and sold them?\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A-And... Am... I...?\" Dan mumbled, fighting vertigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shhh.\" the giant gently quieted him, \"We're getting there. Now, that prospect left a bad taste in everyone's mouths, but God knows people had done worse for less money. So, they decide something. Go out, hand pick a couple hundred or thousand from each city when no one's around, and sell them. And it worked. Holy hell did it <i>work</i>. Most of our customers were self-proclaimed unabashed <i>sadists</i>. But hey, I don't judge, long as it's not hurting nobody.\" He chuckled quietly at the seemingly contradictory nature of his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"S... Sadists?' Dan whimpered in terror as his heart hammered. \"W-Wait, how did you kidnap so many people when you're so--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Big?\" the giant finished. Dan nodded silently. \"It's not all us, you know. We've hired others, your size.\" He tilted his head towards the uniformed men. \"Who do you think drugged your drinks? Dragged you out of your house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But... B... <i>why</i>?!\" Dan spoke in betrayed rage, not to the giant, but to the two men. \"<i>Why would you do such a thing?!</i> WHAT KIND OF MONSTERS ARE YOU?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Through taking this job, they've been given immunity, them and their families. Can you really blame them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I... I could work for you.\" Dan offered, pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No. If I hired every person who bargained their life away, we'd have no product.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"B-But if you wanted to sell me, why would you tell me all this?! W-Wouldn't I just try to run?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because, you <i>silly</i> boy,\" the giant pushed Dan backwards, planting his finger on Dan's chest as Dan screamed in terror, thinking he was about to be crushed, \"it's easier this way, and informing you of it seems to help. Nobody, not even sadists want a pet that has a mental breakdown that leaves them catatonic. As for the memories? A good regimen of sodium pentothal and phenobarbital will make you forget this conversation ever happened. Seems counter-intuitive to even giving you the conversation? It'll be in there, somewhere, deep down. We might even give you proper training before you're let go, teach you how to properly eat pussy and suck cock, if we feel like it. You wanna live in this world? You're gonna have to learn how to treat your master right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-No, no, please!\" he screamed as one of the guards approached him, stun gun at the ready. \"Gh-\" the current flowed through him, making Dan drop like a rock. A bit of drool seeped from the corner of his mouth as his empty, vacant eyes stared upward. The guard nudged Dan to confirm he was unconscious and not just playing dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright boys. We've got work to do.\" the giant man smiled as they dragged Dan's dead weight away.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He pushed himself into a sitting position. No giants around, for now. No guards, either. He quietly took in his surroundings. He was in a room, obviously. It was large, even by giant standards, probably a living room. Its furnishings were sparse, other than the coffee table he was trapped on, there was only a brown leather couch opposite him and a floor lamp in the corner, bathing the room in a warm glow. The beige walls were broken by a doorframe, its door close enough to the floor that someone Dan's size couldn't squeeze through the crack even if he was lying on his stomach. Truly, they had planned for everything. Dan wasn't about to attempt to make a run for it. Chances were, even if he made it off the table completely unharmed, he'd either be carelessly crushed underfoot, caught and \"punished\" (more like tortured), or forced to hide under the couch until he was found, given that his only way out of the room was through an already opened door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The doorknob started to turn, and Dan looked around, uncertain of what was expected of him. He decided the best course of action was to stay put. Two giants entered the room single file, a woman and a man. They stood calmly in front of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Congratulations, little boy.\" The man started, slightly bored yet still with a hint of amusement. He undid his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We're going to teach you how to properly suck and fuck.\" The woman finished, sliding her pencil skirt down her thighs. They were so in sync it was almost scary. Dan turned bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N... No. I...\" He stared at them slowly revealing their genitals to him. It could have been erotic if it weren't so wrong. He scraped up his courage desperately. Dan swallowed. Certainly he must be insane for trying to defy them. \"I refuse.\" The pair burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y'hear that, Charlie?!\" The woman turned to the man, \"He says he ain't gonna do it!\" She doubled over in laughter. Their hysterics cut off abruptly and their expressions hardened into stone-cold resolve, chilling Dan to the bone. \"You've got balls, little man.\" She commended in a fearsome contralto, considerably more gravelly and serious than the higher giggly voice she had used a moment earlier. Dan wanted to run. Dan wanted to run, and run, and never stop running, but he couldn't move. \"Look. We can arrange so you don't have to do this, <i>but</i> if we do, your lifespan will be significantly shortened.\" Dan cautiously took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I don't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course you don't understand.\" She interjected condescendingly. \"This is how it goes. Whoever's hands you end up in, being able to sexually please them is going to make them <i>much</i> more likely to keep you around and well maintained, rather than just a few minutes of screaming entertainment or fodder for some fucking fetish video or something.\" She rubbed her forehead. \"Ultimately the choice is yours, I suppose. What I guess it boils down to is, live or die?\" She looked down at him expectantly. \"Well?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I... L-Live!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, good...\" She murmured. \"Could've just gone along with us from the beginning and spared us the headache...\" the giantess was a bit irate. Dan averted his gaze sheepishly. \"So which do you want to learn first? Pussy or cock? We're giving you a choice here, you'd better take it.\"</span></div></div>",

They \"gave\" him a choice, but in reality there was no choice. He'd end up doing both, so did it even matter what he said? <i>No,</i> he concluded, <i>No it didn't.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright then.\" She sat down on the couch, spreading her legs. She remained professional. \"Let's make one thing clear before we start. It doesn't matter what your name is. It doesn't matter what you think, or what you feel. You're here because we want you to be, and this mentality should carry over to whoever's hands you end up into. When they take you in, you'll stay alive because they have a reason to keep you alive. So I suggest you throw your whole heart into at least this.\" the giantess lectured him with an obviously insincere and rehearsed line. She shrugged as Dan covered his mouth, went completely pale, and shook in fear. \"It's harsh, but that's how  it is.\" Dan made a discomforted noise, like he was fighting back the urge to vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A-Are they... Are they gonna kill me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's always a possibility, which is why this is important.\" She spoke firmly, yet with a twinge of compassion. \"This will give you a fighting chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-No... Please...\" tears started to stream down his cheeks, \"I-I can... I-If you help me get out of here, I-I can... I'll do whatever you want! <i>Anything! Anything at all!</i> P-Please... Y-you seem pretty high up, right? L-like you'd know where I was kidnapped from, i-if you bring me back, I'll...\" Dan was hoping he'd tug on her heartstrings. His hope drained as her expression shifted into one of pity. \"I'll do anything, please... Y-you're my last shot of getting out of here, <i>please...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look... We're not all monsters.\" She cradled Dan in her hands. \"I don't want to come off as a  cold bitch, really I don't, but I've--<i>we've</i>-- done this process hundreds of times before. It's kind of our job.\" Dan's eyes slowly filled with reluctant understanding. \"It's... It's kind of like if... Imagine you worked in some lab for animal testing, easily-bred, manipulable animals--lab mice, I guess--and you weren't morally opposed to it. Now tell me, and tell me true, would you risk your entire career that took years to build to \"rescue\" a few that would probably be re-caught anyhow?\" She looked expectantly with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, I...\" His chest was heavy as he heaved a reluctant sigh, \"I guess I wouldn't.\" Dan's voice wavered, a mumbled whimper. The woman nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now then... If we're finished with the theatrics, I'm gonna help you the way my job allows.\" She slid Dan between her legs and gently nudged him towards her cunt. Dan struggled against her fingers. \"C'mon, you gotta get familiar with it if you're gonna learn how to do it right.\" She continued rather clinically, though a hint of amusement shone through. She never got tired of tinies' reactions to seeing a giant's sex organs for the first time. Dan was just like the rest, staring at her glistening pink lips and fully entranced by the enormous lewd display. \"So anyway, girls are all radically different down here. We've all got the basics, though. I'll teach you those and hopefully she'll tell you how she likes it. So... <i>this</i>\" She dipped her finger inside her lips and drew it around, \"is the labia. Up <i>here</i>\" She slid her fingers along a lump of flesh just above her slit, \"Is the clitoris. That's where you're gonna <i>really</i> have to listen to her, okay? That's where we differ the most.\" Dan nodded obediently. It was all so surreal he was in a bizarrely tranquil, near-dissociative state. She picked him up, gently placing Dan on her pubic mound, \"I'm gonna let you try out some techniques, see what you do right, and where you need to improve, okay?\" Dan tentatively placed his hands on her clit and pushed down. He shuddered in pleasant surprise, it felt more like a soft suede than skin to his touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mm... L-Like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's good. Keep going.\" She encouraged softly. Dan doubled his efforts, brushing his fingers along the edges and slipping them under the hood. Dan bent over, running his tongue along as much as he could manage. He wondered if he could get sexual pleasure out of this as well. He ground his crotch against her clit, humping her while he tended to the rest of it with his lips and outstretched arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"H-How about now?\" the panting in his voice was evident, and not all from exertion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aha...\" She giggled quietly, \"This is good form, for a first-timer. But one thing I think you need to know early on...\" She grasped him, dangling loosely from her right hand while parting her lower lips with her left, \"Some girls are going to want you as a dildo.\" Dan shook his head wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-No, no, no.... Please, no, I-I was good, wasn't I?! D-Didn't I make you happy? Please, I can... I can do better, please!\" Dan was close to sobbing. \"Please, I--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y'know... I'm trying my best to humor you, but I gotta do it.\" She said, almost a whisper. \"It doesn't matter if you were good, or bad, or whatever. This is a fundamental part of training. And right now, if I were you? I'd count my blessings. There are other girls who could've been assigned to this. They're even more indifferent to it than I am, some flat out sadistic. Least I'm giving you a heads up on where you're going instead of just shoving you in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-NO, NO DON'T! PLEASE STOP!\" He cried as she slid him inside of herself. The humid heat was almost unbearable. Two fingers pushed against Dan, sliding over his back and cupping him against them. She was going to finger herself with Dan along for the ride. He desperately struggled for air as he was dragged along the walls. Dan gagged, her juices filling every open hole of his it could find. Worse still, she pressed him firmly against her inner walls, smothering him and any actual chance he had at getting oxygen. She was sucking in air through her teeth and the vagina around him tensed, like she was getting close to an orgasm. <i>At least one of us is having fun...</i> Dan's ribs bent with the sharp contractions of her muscles as she came. She pulled him out with a sigh. Dan coughed, breathless, slime-covered, and sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You did good, little boy. Don't worry, it's almost over.\" She rubbed Dan's back as he hacked up fluid from his lungs. \"We're gonna clean you off, then you learn with Charlie, then it's over, okay?\" She attempted to comfort him as Dan balled himself up and wailed in terror.</span></div></div>",

They made him cry and filled his entire body with visceral dread. There was one merit to her, at least. She didn't berate him for crying. Dan stared intently at the ground, trying to fully pull himself from the vivid recollection and remind himself of his current location. <i>He wasn't there anymore.

Haah....\" Dan's heart was pounding. He could make out the saccades and fixations of her eyes. Her deep breaths made it sound as though she was receiving great pleasure just from staring at him, to Dan it sounded almost... orgasmic. \"You're just... so <i>beautiful</i>...\" Her abhorrent admiration made him want to hurl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Th... ank....

A whimper escaped his throat as he stared at the wooden floor at least a hundred feet beneath him. He tried desperately to right himself and failed miserably. Anna smiled at the display, enjoying his efforts and frustration until he eventually gave up. Anna licked her lips and took in the view of his stomach exposed by his ridden up shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're just... So... <i>Beautiful</i>. The throbbing in her loins was almost too much as she leaned in and kissed his tummy. She sighed in contentment while he squirmed, trying to get away from her while not simultaneously plummeting to the ground. \"We're gonna have some <i>fun</i> together now, 'kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"F-Fun? Wh-\" Dan's head smashed onto wood, leaving him dazed and seeing stars. Dan groaned, pain radiating through his skull from the point of impact. He found himself trapped against the table by her fingers. She waved something in front of his face, he squinted, trying to make out what it was. A sewing pin. She held it suspended above his head, taking aim for one of Dan's arms. \"P-Please, please don't!\" She plunged it down. Dan inhaled sharply, closing his eyes and futilely trying to pull away like an animal caught in a leg trap. He yelped when it slammed against the wood. The few moments it took to process the pain he <i>should</i> have been feeling, but didn't feel felt like a lifetime. It didn't hurt. <i>He hadn't been impaled.</i> Dan cracked open one eye as he gulped back the scratchiness in his throat. His anxious panting only intensified the quiver of his adrenaline-spiked heart. He turned his head to look at his left arm, where burning agony <i>should</i> have been coming from, only to find his arm pinned down by a colorfully tipped stake of metal through the fabric of his shirt. Two pins lay embedded in the wood through each of the sleeves. Two more pinned down his legs. Just a bit further than his fingertips lay a pocket knife, a sewing needle, a pair of nail scissors, and a lighter, to name a few. A large damp stain ran down the front of his track pants. \"Y-You...\" He breathed, speaking rather recklessly given the circumstances, \"You call this <i>fun</i>?!\" A cruelly amused smile unfurled on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ha! You pissed yourself.\" She whispered callously, drawing out every syllable to hammer in Dan's humiliation. \"And yeah, I'm having <i>loads</i> of fun!\" She straddled the table, hovering her panty covered crotch just above him. \"Aren't you?\" Dan stammered something unintelligible and let out a strained noise through gritted teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-You...\" Dan struggled to hold back his overwhelmed tears. <i>His family was searching, his kidnappers were cruel, and his captor was psychotically in love with him...</i> \"You horrible ugly bitch... Either let me go or kill me, because I HATE YOU! I'm <i>NOT</i> gonna fucking <i>sit here</i> and be your goddamn pet boyfriend <i>ANYMORE!</i>\" Anna's expression turned sour and she sent her full weight careening atop the tiny, terrified, screaming boy below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dan would have pissed himself again, had he not already emptied his bladder. He had never experienced a shiver like this before, one hundred percent certain he was shaking from his head all the way down to the tips of his toes. \"Ooh!\" Dan closed his eyes and jerked away. Anna picked up the nail scissors, opening and closing them a few times. \"Snip, snip, snip...\" She said rather childishly. \"You wanna go home, right?\" Dan reluctantly nodded. She stared at the scissors blankly. \"Hey, how d'you think your family would feel about getting you back in pieces?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I...\" The squeak barely left Dan's throat. He hoped, prayed, <i>needed</i> her to just be joking, but at this point he couldn't count on anything anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm not ready to give you up <i>just</i> yet.\" Dan quietly sighed in relief when she put the scissors down. \"Hm...\" She mulled her options, occasionally glancing around the room for additional tools. \"I think... I'll use... This!\" She grabbed the sewing pin and lighter. The lighter was lit after a few tries, and the tip of the needle glowed red-hot. Tossing the lighter over her shoulder, Anna placed the burning needle just above Dan's chest. Dan's eyes watered. He wasn't sure if it was from fear or the heat. The needle plunged down. The noise of Dan's scream was barely discernible as human, reverberating through his skull. He couldn't tear his eyes away from the unfolding scene. A searing stake of metal was about to force its way through his skin and entangle itself in his guts, severely wounding if not killing him. Dan's stomach plummeted. The needle came down... and missed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan's shirt singed and skin stung from the burn of flesh on metal, but that was it. His organs stayed where they belonged. She had faked him out. She was still grinning madly at him. She tore up the pins with one hand, her other fiercely swiping Dan off the table. Dan was certain in that moment, he would die. What he hadn't been counting on was falling into a heap of clothes on the floor. He dragged himself out, dizzy and disoriented, and came face-to-face with a new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He had only ever seen her close to her level, at her hips or higher. But now, as he stumbled backwards on the floor and she rose to her full height before him, Dan was forced to take in her full stature the way it was meant to be viewed. The top of his head just barely managed to reach her ankle bone. It was truly a sight to behold. She became less like a person with every advancing step, and more and more like an organic weapon. Something meant to cut down, destroy, crush, and tear anything in her way, that wouldn't stop until her target was neutralized or dead. Dwarfed in her shadow, Dan trembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You truly are a pitiful creature... Do you really think you could run from me? Do you really believe you deserve a life outside of this?\" She raised an eyebrow as she sneered down in contempt, anticipating Dan's next move. Dan stared up, wracking his brain for an answer and silently moving his lips, but no words would come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan found himself rendered unable to speak, reduced to a stammering mess. What could he say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, of course not.\" She berated. \"Of course not, you pathetic, <i>ugly</i> thing...\" She took a step forward, covering more ground in one stride than Dan could hope to at a sprinting pace. Dan cowered in between her feet. \"I could crush you right now, like a little bug... I bet I wouldn't even feel you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-no... Please, <i>please</i>... D-don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then give me a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A <i>reason</i>, Daniel. <i>Now.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't wanna die...\" Dan whimpered softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not good enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Be...\" He gently gripped his side. \"Because you <i>need</i> me. Because somewhere in that <i>freak show</i> mind of yours, you love me too much to let me die. <i>Isn't that right?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe you're not as stupid as I first thought...\" Anna had a contented look on her face while she bent over and raised Dan nearly 150 feet in the span of a few seconds. \"If you'd use half of that intelligence towards compliance instead of defiance, your life might be a little better.\" She tossed him and his new clothes into his temporary home. \"Try a little obedience next time. Might work in your favor. I'll come back with some burn cream to help you through that, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks...\" Dan begrudgingly mumbled as he changed out of his singed and piss stained clothes. Anna abruptly closed the drawer on him, much to Dan's discontent. <i>She'd get another pet.</i> She decided. A little leverage never hurt, playing a game like this...</span></div></div>",

Standing above him was his captor with a squirming person in each hand. A young blonde woman was draped over her right fist, sobbing. In her left, a dark-haired man screaming in impotent frustration and terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dDan?\u201d The giantess happily ignored the protests of the people in her hands, \u201cI brought you some friends!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dF-Friends?\u201d Dan stammered. Anna\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d pet man looked at Dan in a silent state of horror. This poor man had been kidnapped and broken. The same would happen to himself and the woman. Then\u2026 They would all suffer together... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dMhmm!\u201d She dropped her two captives carelessly. \u201cNow, you all be nice to each other...\u201d Anna warned. Dan\u2019s eyes stayed locked in a traumatized thousand-yard stare as she thundered off into the distance to let them get properly acquainted. The blonde buried her face into the man\u2019s shoulder and sobbed. The man looked to be having a hard time dealing with the situation himself, waiting for Dan to brief them on the nightmare they were about to endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dWhat she said\u2026 I\u2026 <i>Please</i>, you have to understand, I didn\u2019t want this\u2026 I didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t <i>want this...</i>\u201d Dan shook his head slightly, \u201c<i>I didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t...</i>\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dHey\u2026 Hey\u2026 I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t.\u201d the new arrival tried to gently comfort the man in front of him. Clearly he wasn\u2019t here of his own volition, either. \u201cTake a deep breath. We need you to help us.\u201d He squeezed the shoulder of the inconsolable woman. His calmness was of course, a front. Inside, he was screaming and terrified as much as the others, but he\u2019d never get any answers if he broke down now. Dan took in a shaking breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dOkay...\u201d He sniffled, wiping tears from his face. \u201cUm\u2026 Wh-What are your names?

Terror didn\u2019t begin to define what he was feeling. He had been given the task of telling these two poor innocent people what they were going to endure until they either died or she got tired of them. \u201cS-S-So, um\u2026 I need to know a little bit about you before I can\u2026 Um, what I mean is\u2026 Do you\u2026 Have you ever, uh\u2026 seen <i>them</i> before?

He <i>couldn\u2019t.</i> \u201cB-But uh\u2026 I\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019ve been here. A few days? A couple weeks? My sleep schedule\u2019s kind of fucked up, and with it being winter and all, the sun doesn\u2019t come out very often\u2026\u201d Jack dejectedly looked at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dShe expects us to live in her underwear drawer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dIt\u2019s better than what I showed up in. A plastic box. I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think she\u2019s trying to degrade us with it, either. It was just\u2026 convenience. It\u2019s warm and soft, at least.\u201d Dan tapped the tights he was standing on with his hand. \u201cSpacious...\u201d Jack truly felt pity for the man before him. Dan was quite obviously trying to scrape together every silver lining he could find to keep his sanity. \u201cY-You\u2019ll get used to it too, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Dan continued. \u201cJ-Just like I am. Then soon enough, it\u2019ll barely\u2026 Barely even...\u201d Dan quietly sank to the ground and started to cry. \u201cTh-This wasn\u2019t\u2026 This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen, it wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way...\u201d Mandy wrapped her arms around the stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dShh. It\u2019ll be okay. You're okay. We're all okay. We\u2019ll get through this. We\u2019ll all get through this, don't worry. We know you didn\u2019t want this to happen\u2026 We know...\u201d He wasn\u2019t a stranger anymore. He was Dan. And Dan, Jack, and herself were now in this together for better or worse. </span></div></div>",

Guess What Happened Today?!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn older video, one she pulled up just to watch again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan looked around frantically for a way out of this nightmare. Her hands were folded under her chin and she wore a placid smile. Dan gazed up at her,  shaking down to his bones. His eyes darted to the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHelp me\u2026 Please, help me\u2026 I-I\u2026 I don\u2019t know where I am, but I\u2026 I don\u2019t wanna be here, sh-she\u2026 She <i>kidnapped</i> me.

Like he was saying, I uh\u2026 \u201cfound\u201d a new pet today! His name\u2019s Dan and he\u2019s the cutest, sweetest little thing I\u2019ve ever seen, aha!\u201d She giggled as the tiny man tried to combat her hand in an attempt to be seen again. \u201cOh! I guess he really wants to say hi! Calm down, little one, you\u2019ll get your chance...\u201d She twirled a strand of hair around her finger. \u201cSo um anyway\u2026 I\u2019m having <i>tons</i>  of fun with him! Discipline\u2019s a little hard, but so far I just have to leave him alone for a long time. The hunger wins out in the end. Ooorrrr, sometimes I have to threaten to crush him to get him to do what I want. Mmm\u2026 That\u2019s all I got to say for now. How about you, sweetie?\u201d The camera zoomed in to clearly show Dan\u2019s tear-tracked face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood God somebody <i>help me</i>!

Or, to train him, tread on him lightly, enough to bruise but not kill. Take something soft like a banana and crush it in your toes, then make him lick it off. He should be worshiping you.

None of them knew it was real, well, except the humans. All the tinies thought it was an act, a simple, green-screened fetish film. They had no idea that they themselves could be the next stars of the fantasy they loved so much. She loved making video diaries of her little pets. She could relive their first terrified moments over again as many times as she pleased.  Anna glanced over to the closed drawer, where Mandy and Jack were recovering from being her most recent stars. She had a feeling these three would be very, <i>very</i> popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy clung to Dan and cried. Jack stared at the ground despondently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, no, no, I was so close--! Th-those people, commenting\u2026 Th-they...\u201d Jack swallowed back disgust.  \u201cThey were like <i>us.</i> They were like <i>us</i> and they thought we were\u2026 actors. They thought she wasn\u2019t real and we were actors for some fucking film to get their rocks off to. Well, they can take my fucking place, fine by me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah\u2026 I know. She made one of me, too\u2026\u201d Dan sniffled and finished his drink, letting out a slight cough as it burned all the way down. \u201cThey sa\u2014they said, \u201cMaybe if he doesn\u2019t like being a pet, he\u2019d make a good snack\u201d They wanted\u2014They wanted her to fucking <i>eat</i> me. Said if I didn\u2019t know how good I had it as her \u201cpet\u201d I\u2019d be better off as food.\u201d Dan\u2019s cheeks flushed. \u201cI tried to scream for help. They laughed. Some called me an ungrateful brat, said I should be tortured into submission for not enjoying being a giant\u2019s pet.\u201d He smiled crookedly. \u201cSome of the funny ones, though. The guy who\u2019s a giant and knows this is real, he said he wus jealous \u2018f me. Sa\u2014said he\u2019d love to be one of us, said even if he wasn\u2019t he\u2019d come over here and be Anna\u2019s slave with me \u2018nd help me deal. Break the \u201cillusion\u201d that all giants are cruel. \u201cComfort me through it\u201d or some shit like that.\u201d Dan hiccuped and laughed, obviously blitzed. \u201c\u2019t was kinda cute, almost\u2026 like he actually cared \u2018bout whut\u2019s goin\u2019 on here...\u201d Dan began to yearn for another cup of the cheap rum Anna had let them have from her stash, but had no desire to get up from his reclining position. She\u2019d given them enough to loosen up, but not enough to induce death from alcohol poisoning, should one decide to attempt it. \u201cThen there wuz th\u2019s one girl wh\u2019 thought I wuz a actor fer some fetish company. Wanted m\u2019 full name. Said I wuz a hottie \u2018n could be a model. Tha\u2019 wuz sweet\u2026 I mean, Anna says tha\u2019 all th\u2019 time, b\u2019 considerin\u2019 how psycho she is a...bout me, it doezn\u2019t really mean \u2018s mucsh, y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, they um...\u201d Jack wrung his hands. \u201cThey wanted to know if she was still in \u201ccontact\u201d with you. Wanted to see if you could\u2026 \u201creprise your role\u201d as her pet slave.\u201d Dan let out an amused drunken wheeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShpose I dun\u2019 really have a choice, do I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDan\u2026 Maybe you should slow down a little.\u201d Mandy piped up as Dan fell flat on his face in an attempt to get another glass of booze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNuh...\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI dun\u2019 wanna scare you, Mandy, cuz you...\u201d he hiccuped, \u201cy\u2019seem like a real sweetheart. Buh th\u2019 reality is, she\u2019s done shit t\u2019 me I dun\u2019 wanna remember ever again. Even this jus\u2019 barely helps.

Or\u2014no, <i>she</i> did that to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dI-I\u2026 \u2018m sorry...\u201d Dan whimpered.

And I got here, and I was <i>lucky.</i> She wanted to love me. She <i>wanted</i> to love me. But I wouldn\u2019t\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t let her. I s-said such horrible things, awful things\u2026 But she\u2014she <i>still</i>\u2026 She didn\u2019t kill me, even though she could have, easily.

Chances are if you try, or she catches either of you trying to convince me, she\u2019ll\u2026 she\u2019ll kill you. She told me so herself, long before she brought you here. She\u2019ll <i>eat you alive.</i> I don\u2019t want that. You don\u2019t want that.\u201d Dan got a little fervent. \u201cPlease, just <i>try</i> to be good.

Are you just going to let them think you\u2019re dead and never coming home because you\u2019ve given up?!\u201d Jack yelled in a whisper. He held no ill will against this man, truly, but it was quite apparent he was far from a rational state of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dTh-That\u2019s not <i>fair</i>, I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201d<i>ARE YOU?!</i>\u201d Jack pinned Dan to the floor, kneeling on his abdomen. Amanda curled her knees to her chest, eyes red and puffy as she helplessly watched the two men fighting. <i>They shouldn\u2019t go against each other like this, they should stick together! This was all her fault\u2026 She instigated this\u2026 This was all her fault...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dYES!\u201d Dan roared, shoving Jack off of him in a herculean effort and rising to his feet. He let all his pent-up frustrations explode out in one string of uncharacteristic stress-triggered rage and vulgarity. \u201cDon\u2019t you FUCKING <i>DARE</i> come in here for one day and try to tell ME how to handle what I\u2019ve been going through for <i>WEEKS</i>! I\u2019ve been kidnapped. Molested. <i>Raped</i>. Drowned. She played Russian Roulette with me, but with fucking <i>sewing pins</i> instead of bullets!\u201d Dan clenched his teeth so hard they threatened to crack. His fingers curled like claws and he looked about ready to launch himself into the air and attempt to strangle Jack to death. \u201cIf <i>that\u2019s</i> what she does when she \u201cloves\u201d me, I KNOW <i>for a fact</i> that if we tried to run, no less than two of us would end up dead in an excruciating manner. The third would either be left to rot until they bent to her will unquestioningly out of madness OR tortured to death over a series of days!\u201d He glanced at Amanda, head buried in her knees and sobbing not only from the fight but also graphic description of torture to come. \u201cSo, <i>JACK</i>...\u201d Dan spit his name venomously, \u201cWhen you get <i>half</i> of my experience under your belt, and trust me, <i>you will</i>, <i>THEN</i> you can come and talk to me about your fucking <i>ESCAPE PLANS</i>. Because you know what?! I\u2019d fucking rather be stuck here and have my family think I was dead, than having them think I was dead and ACTUALLY BE DEAD!\u201d Dan took a deep breath. \u201cAnd you know what else? If we did somehow escape, or get killed, she\u2019d just grab some other poor saps off the street. This psycho bitch collects people like other girls collect dolls. Oh yeah, another great brain-breaking tidbit: The size difference always existed. You didn\u2019t shrink. No, no. You'll remember that fact soon enough. The reason she doesn\u2019t have a problem with it? Because to her, we were never anything more than <i>fucking dolls!</i>\u201d Tears and snot ran down Dan\u2019s face. His hair stuck wildly in all directions and his face was bright red. All in all, he looked like hell. \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d He murmured quietly, dragging a pair of socks to the opposite end of the drawer, far away from Jack and Amanda. Mandy had half a mind to follow and try to comfort him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dNo.\u201d Jack held her back. \u201cHe just needs to sort this out. I\u2019ll apologize tomorrow, then\u2026 hopefully we\u2019ll get back on track.\u201d A knife twisted in Jack\u2019s stomach, with him morbidly wondering what kind of torture would lead to that kind of emotional outburst. Ice froze in his veins when he realized that he and Mandy were likely to find out firsthand.</span></div></div>",

He was curled up on the ground with his back to her, breathing slowly. Jack leaned against one of the walls of the drawer, deep in thought. Mandy stood, managing two steps in Dan\u2019s direction before being stopped by a hand clamping around her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dLet me go.\u201d She stated much calmer than she\u2019d expect, given the circumstances. \u201cI said let me go, asshole.\u201d She tried to tug her wrist from Jack\u2019s grip. \u201cI swear to God, Jack, let me go right now or I\u2019ll scream. I will scream so fucking loud her neighbors will think she\u2019s torturing a rabbit to death. And when she comes to shut me up, she\u2019s gonna be <i>pissed off.</i> And y\u2019know I think we should all stick together, but if we get in trouble because <i>you</i> didn\u2019t take your hands off me, you bet damn well I\u2019m gonna shift the blame on you. Last chance. Let. Me. <i>Go.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dI\u2019d listen to her, Jack.\u201d Both Amanda and Jack turned their attention to Dan, who hadn\u2019t moved a muscle, though he had definitely said it. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t <i>want</i> to punish us right now, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here alone. <i>So</i>, if you give her a reason to hand out discipline, you\u2019ve <i>royally</i> fucked up. One of us gets punished, we ALL get punished. I don\u2019t know about you, but I quite enjoy having all my bones intact. And don\u2019t think for a second she\u2019d be gentle because it\u2019s your first time.\u201d Dan\u2019s heart raced in his chest. His body began to quiver almost instinctively at the idea of punishment. <i>Broken bones, bent ribs, searing stakes of metal, half-drowning,  suffocation...</i> How little of a care she gave to his\u2014now their\u2014safety when disobedient was concerning to say the least. He wished she could do \u201cnormal\u201d punishments like missing meals or having his bed taken away. It would be uncomfortable and take a mental toll on him, but it would be preferable to constant agony. Hell, he\u2019d even be up for the humiliation of being spanked until he was red and crying like a five year old. It would suck hard, but at least it would be over sooner than searing pain every time he tried to breathe. \u201cLet her go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jack\u2019s grip on Mandy\u2019s arm loosened. She hastily tore herself from his hold groaning something about him under her breath, taking long strides to Dan\u2019s side. Dan didn\u2019t roll over or even acknowledge her as she knelt next to him and ran her fingers down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dDan...?\u201d No response. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be okay. We\u2019re here. We\u2019re together, and we\u2019re safe.\u201d Mandy kissed him gently on the cheek. Dan froze. This was the first kiss he\u2019d gotten in months that didn\u2019t involve his chest being enveloped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dSafe?\u201d A bit of disdain couldn\u2019t help but creep into his voice. \u201cNo. Least, not usually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dWhat\u2019s it like? Being\u2026 <i>here</i>, I mean? Being a...\u201d Amanda crawled over Dan, settling down on the sock so they were looking each other in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dPet? Sex slave?\u2026.  Just <i>peachy.</i>\u201d Tears ran down Dan\u2019s face as he laughed in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dOh, you\u2019re crying!! Th-that\u2019s okay, w-we\u2014we don\u2019t have to talk about that if you don\u2019t want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dNo\u2014no, no, it\u2019s\u2026 She fuckin\u2019 brought you here because she thought I was gonna be lonely!\u201d Dan wiped his tears with the heel of his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault, Mandy, it\u2019s\u2014if I hadn\u2019t been so weak, then\u2014B-But don\u2019t worry, ha! I-I\u2019m sure that in a couple months I\u2019ll b-be totally adjusted, I\u2019ll be happy when she\u2019s happy and she won\u2019t hurt me anymore because I\u2019ll be <i>good!</i>\u201d He panted, almost like he was choking on something. \u201c<i>Right?!?!</i>\u201d A guttural noise of discomfort exited his throat. \u201cI could <i>never</i> let my parents or my sister know, b-because\u2014I <i>know</i> they can\u2019t help me. A-and I got myself into this mess. I did, really. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not going to have those I love the most risk their lives to save me, because chances are, they\u2019re not even going to succeed! I\u2019d rather they live their lives without me than have them crushed into smears because I was too <i>selfish</i> to put their safety first!\u201d Dan coughed. \u201cA-Anyway, it\u2019s not\u2026 so bad, I guess. U-Usually um, you sit here and wait. She\u2019ll come get us when she needs us for meals, or baths, or...\u201d He swallowed hard, getting a strange, almost mournful look in his eyes. \u201cS-Sex. A-And um, even that\u2019s just\u2026 If she\u2019s giving it, just lay there and take it. If she\u2019s getting it, she\u2019ll tell you what she needs. So far, she\u2019s been gracious enough to not use me as a\u2026\u201d Dan paused, his mouth unwilling to form the word. \u201cJust try to keep your wits about you, remember it\u2019ll be over soon enough, and above all, watch your tongue. That\u2019s how I got this.\u201d He gingerly rubbed the burn on his abdomen. \u201cI mouthed off and she was having none of it. Uh\u2026 Last of all I guess is, she gives us stuff to do when she\u2019s not using us. Saw you messing with some cards earlier, she gives us paper and pencils, personally I\u2019ve been keeping a journal, mmm\u2026 and\u2026 I think I may have sweet talked her into getting a TV and a gaming console in here. I\u2019d kill for a smoke, though. The stress is driving me mad.\u201d The nails of his index finger and thumb quietly clicked together and Mandy suddenly noticed the cuticles of all his fingers were picked raw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dDinnertime!\u201d All three of her captives nearly jumped out of their skins as plates with chunks of waffles and bacon clattered to the ground. Jack and Mandy watched Dan in trepidation as he approached the food and began to eat as if nothing was wrong. Giving into their hunger seeing as the food was apparently safe, the other two quickly followed suit. \u201cGood! You\u2019re learning! Wait\u2026 What\u2019s that smell?\u201d Dan, Jack, and Mandy froze, exchanging nervous glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dU-Um\u2026 Dan drank too much. B-But don\u2019t worry! He made sure he made it to a bucket first.\u201d Jack hurriedly explained, stealing a glance at Dan, who had gone completely rigid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dDan?\u201d asked Anna, pulling the bottle cap filled with acrid vomit out of the drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dY...Yeah?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dSlow down a little, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dOkay...\u201d He mumbled, Mandy, Jack, and himself breathing a collective sigh of relief. Anna gave them all a contented little smile and left them to finish their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201d\u2026 Hey Dan?\u201d Jack tapped his index fingers together idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dM\u2019sorry about what I said before. We\u2026 We all react to stress in different ways, y\u2019know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dI know.\u201d He took a bite of bacon. \u201cSo how was your first day as a human hamster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dIt was\u2026 Definitely something.\u201d Jack confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dYou haven\u2019t seen anything yet. On my\u2026 first day\u2026 It was so bad I uh\u2026\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to give up the embarrassing details. \u201cI pissed myself.\u201d Dan stacked the empty plates together and stood up. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe there are people who would want this. And someday, if she gets her hands on someone who does, I want to meet them. Maybe just to pick their brain apart.  They\u2019d probably love it here...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dWell...\u201d Amanda stretched with an air of finality, refusing to dwell on the disturbing idea any longer. \u201cI\u2019m about ready to turn in for the night. Aren\u2019t you, Jack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dYeah\u2026 And if what Dan tells us is true, then\u2026 We\u2019re gonna need a lot of sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dI\u2019ve got clothes you can wear until she gets more. We\u2019re about the same size, right Jack?\u201d Dan rifled through a pile. \u201cHere.\u201d A white t-shirt and plaid pajama bottoms were thrust into Jack\u2019s arms. \u201cAnd\u2026 Here.\u201d He handed Mandy a black shirt with a decal on it, the name of some band she didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cPromise I won\u2019t look.\u201d Dan covered his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cDone.\u201d Mandy and Jack said, a moment\u2019s lapse between each confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dWhoa Mandy, you look\u2026 so...\u201d Dan murmured. The shirt was easily 2  times too big on her frame, sleeves hanging to her elbows and the bottom hem reaching past her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dSo...\u201d Jack joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201d<i>Cute!</i>\u201d The two men gushed at the adorable sight. Mandy rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dAnyway, um, we basically sleep wherever we want. I\u2019m partial to the tights, and there\u2019s plenty of room. If you get cold, cover up with whatever you find, she doesn\u2019t care.\u201d Dan settled down, watching the other two follow suit. He had a feeling they\u2019d sleep deeply tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan cracked an eye open. The strange pounding came in sets of two, like\u2026 footsteps. Squinting in the darkness, he could just barely make out a human outline. Jack. He hadn\u2019t slept, instead spending the wee hours of the morning anxiously pacing across the floor and it sounded like he was holding in tears.</span></div></div>",

Dan uncurled from his sleeping position. \"<i>Jaaack!</i>\" he hissed. Jack stumbled to a stop, tripping over his own feet in surprise and landing hard on the ground. His only saving grace was the fact the floor underneath him was covered in clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>What?</i>\" Jack grumbled as he picked himself off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You <i>need</i> to go to bed! If you don't, she'll... I dunno, but nothing good, and I'd really rather not test her limits right now!\" Dan's whisper was harsh. \"Do you want me to give you the full fucking dossier on what she's done <i>to me?!</i>\" Jack reluctantly trudged towards Dan, landing heavily next to him. Jack took a deep breath and rested his arms on his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I just...\" Jack rubbed his eye with his hand, \"I can't sleep. Adrenaline and all that, y'know, fear response.\" He chuckled half-heartedly, a clearly piss-poor attempt at trying to make himself feel better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I <i>really</i> don't mean to freak you out, but you seem a lot less scared than you should be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am.\" Jack countered. \"But if I show it, I'll... I just d-don't want--\" Dan noticed a slight tremor in Jack's hands as he let his mask slip for a moment. \"One thing I learned in this shithole life is that if I show I'm afraid, things are only gonna get worse. Trust me, you'll see just how scared I am when she gives me a good reason to put a show on for her. Begging, screaming, crying, bargaining, whole nine yards. Just... promise you won't think any less of me for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wouldn't dream of it.\" Dan stifled a yawn. \"I'll tell you what to do when we wake up. I'm gonna do my best to make sure you and Mandy don't get hurt, okay? I... I don't want you to.\" He shot a longing glance at Mandy's curled up body nested under the first fold of tights, using it like a blanket. \"I-I'll try to take the fall for you whenever I can, and I'll teach you how to behave... I-It'll be fine.\" He swallowed, heart beating a little faster. \"Y-Yeah... It'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dan... Why...\" the words came to Jack slowly as he collected his thoughts, \"Why would you do this for two... complete strangers?\" Dan's head tilted slightly and his brow furrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because it's all my fault.\" Dan answered in a puzzled, innocent tone with no trace of guilt behind it, as if he had genuinely accepted it being his fault as an indisputable fact and not an internalized conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dan, I don't understand. How on earth is a psychotic giant kidnapping us your fault--<i>all</i> of us mind you, I don't think you're here because you wanna be, right?\" Dan shook his head frantically like there was a bee in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N... No, I don't want to be here. but--but I... I-I... I d-didn't want to be alone, and I let it slip, a-and she--she <i>brought</i> you here. For <i>me</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-Well, maybe she did.\" Jack mumbled, \"But that doesn't mean it's your fault! It was all her! She wanted to! ...to do this to us! She just used you as an excuse to drag more people into her sick little fantasy of keeping people as pets, don't you see?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"M-Maybe you're right.\" Dan responded, still reluctant to believe it. \"But... <i>god</i>,\" He put a hand on his forehead, \"that just makes it even worse, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"... What's done is done. Me and Mandy are here now. There's no point in dwelling on \"what if\" questions anymore, or her motives, or \"what might have been\". It would just make us all miserable.\" Jack laid on the ground. \"I'm gonna go to sleep like you told me, but in exchange you gotta do something for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Try to stop thinking about it. If we all just stick together like Mandy said, and do what we're told, we'll be fine... Right? Dan?\" Dan didn't respond, his eyes shut tight as he feigned sleep. \"Okay. Guess we'll talk in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good morning everyone!\" Sunlight met Dan's eyes along with the face of his giant captor. He reluctantly crawled out to meet her, noticing Mandy stirring under the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Jack...</i>\" Dan hissed, shaking him on the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mm...\" Jack groaned, covering his eyes with one hand and pulling the blanket over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jack, wake up.\" Dan shook him even harder. Jack cracked open an eye, a sudden clarity reminding him exactly where he was. He wasn't safe here. He couldn't afford to go back to sleep, as much as he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nnnhh... I'm up. I'm up.\" The blanket was cast off and every fiber of his being screamed at him to lay back down and sleep until he woke up from this nightmare. \"Wh-'s... Wha's goin' on?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good morning, Jack. Did you sleep okay?\" <i>Crap. That's what was going on.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mm... Y-Yeah, it was fine.\" He glanced at Dan, who maintained a somewhat nervous expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How about you, Mandy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh... fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good, good.\" Anna smiled a warm, genuine smile. \"Ready for a big day, sweeties?\" She put down the cover for a thermos. It contained a poached egg, broken open and letting the yolk drip out. A half a slice of toast with margarine and a thimble of water quickly followed. Dan's mouth began to water, and a more rational part of him silently cursed himself for responding like a damn dog. \"I hope you all eat enough. You're gonna need energy for what I have planned.\" </span></div></div>",

Jack and Mandy appeared somewhat unnerved, meanwhile Dan looked as though he were about to lose his breakfast all over his clean clothes. \"Don't puke, Dan. You've done this before, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Dan murmured, shaking his head in disbelief and desperately trying to keep his meal from coming back up. \"No. It's not... No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Dan. It's not that bad.\" She offered him a lopsided smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, SAYS YOU--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan...\" She held him precariously by an ankle. \"You remember how this went last time... Don't you?\" Despite the blood rushing to his head, Dan felt his heart start to pound a little faster every second. He swallowed uneasily, subconsciously beginning to feel all his airways closing. \"Mhmm. Yeah, of course you do. But y'know... It doesn't have to be like that this time around. Now everyone, take off your clothes.\" Jack and Mandy exchanged worried glances among themselves and Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what she says.\" Dan whispered hurriedly before he was lowered back into the drawer. He too took off his clothes before he could dwell on it. All her living toys had reluctantly stripped themselves bare, not wanting to escalate an already volatile situation. Mandy and Jack tried to cover themselves with their hands. Dan stood with no such modesty, his cheeks red and hot with shame. Being exposed in front of his friends was the least of his concerns now. She eagerly scooped them up in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh you all look so cute.\" Her grin couldn't possibly get any wider. \"And Mandy, you just look so...\" She chewed the inside of her lip, \"Haa.... Nnh....\" Mandy quivered in fear. \"L-Let's get started soon, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we're not people...\" Dan pondered, \"Does this mean what you're about to do is bestiality? You really are one<i> fucking depraved giant cunt</i>.\" He remarked dryly with a quiet laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bestiality would require an animal. There are no animals here. There are no people here, There's me and three objects. Three <i>things</i>.\" Anna sat on the mattress, placing them all between her legs. \"Now I'd shut your mouth before one of my things gets a particularly rough use.\" Dan quickly fell silent. She certainly had a way of striking terror into him. Jack and Mandy, meanwhile, seemed at a loss for what to do, occasionally shooting nervous glances at their owner's anatomy and letting out an infrequent cough from the overpowering scent. \"Do we have any volunteers?\" No one dared to meet her eyes. \"Fine. How about this, then?\" She snatched up the men, placing them atop her breasts. Mandy looked around in a sudden panic before finding herself trapped in a fist as well. \"You boys get the easy part, just lie back and let me massage you all over what I have. Not only that, you get to watch some girl-in-girl action. Some guys would consider you awfully fucking lucky. Do a good job, no one gets hurt, understand?\" The two men nodded robotically in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're joking, <i>right?</i>\" Mandy pleaded as she was positioned headfirst for another woman's drooling pussy. \"You're not actually going to--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>MANDY</i>!\" Dan and Jack screamed in horrified unison as the bombshell blonde disappeared from their sight completely, almost as if she had been consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, she'll be f-fiineee... I can feel her right n--\" A sudden stop came to her words. \"Hoo... Yeah... She's doing real well...\" She flattened Jack against her skin with her left hand, dragging him over her breast and down the solid bumps of her ribs. \"Ooh... You're doing well too, little man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan was transfixed in horror as Mandy's slime covered body was dragged out from between the giant's legs. The poor disoriented woman was given only a moment to catch her breath before being plunged deep into the smothering cave. Anna was lost in the pleasure of two new toys to play with. Dan wondered if she cared at all for the fact she could potentially kill Mandy by accident right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop!\" Dan shouted as he watched the situation unfold. \"You're going to kill her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I know what I'm doing.\" Anna squirmed a bit with Mandy fully inside, sliding Jack along her warm thighs and outer lips. Unfortunately for Mandy, her kicks and punches only served to stimulate her captor more. \"But if you're so fucking obsessed with her condition, why don't you go and check on her yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh--\" Dan managed to get out just as he was yanked off her breast with her free hand and shoved between her lower lips into close quarters with Mandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck, why have I never tried this before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey--Mandy--I'm--\" Talking was difficult, if not impossible. \"I-I'm here--for you--gh...\" Despite their size, it was a tight fit. \"I'm s-sorry this is--oh God, I'm so sorry! I-I--\" Dan huffed, cheeks obviously hot with embarrassment and shame despite the muggy conditions. Given the adequate lubrication and lack of personal space, Amanda and Dan inadvertently had intimate contact as well. \"I didn't mean to touch you like that, sorry! I swear I didn't mean it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know.\" Mandy fought her own blush. \"Distractions. We need distractions. You said you've done this before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh y-yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would get us out of here the fastest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry about this...\" He slammed himself against Mandy's back, wrapping his arms just beneath her breasts and propelled them both upward. Dan's hands faltered from the sudden movement, landing directly on her breasts. Mandy cried out in surprise. \"Fuck, sorry! This is the only way. I'm <i>so</i> sorry...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's... It's okay. Keep... Keep going, please.\" Mandy whimpered, overloaded with sensation. Dan thrust the both of them forward, sliding along the ribbed walls. Mandy giggled, dreamy euphoria beginning to swim in her head despite it all. Who cares where she was? She was warm, had a hottie grinding against her, her skin was tingling with pleasure, it's all she needed--all she wanted--right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you holding up okay?\" Dan asked in between thrusts, a bit out of breath as the walls around them had tightened. Unsurprisingly to herself, Mandy could barely get a word out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel <i>amazing</i>.\" Slurred from the back of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, good, we're almost done, <i>and...</i>\" The walls around them shuddered. \"I guess she finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo fingers clenched the pair's ankles and dragged the cum-covered bodies out of herself, allowing them to flop onto the mattress like rag dolls. The four of them stared at each other with half-focused eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They certainly taught you something at that place, didn't they Dan?\" Anna asked as Dan tried to snap the drooling, delirious Mandy back to reality. \"What did you do to her in there, huh?\" She noted with a small bit of bemused amusement that Mandy appeared to be masturbating. \"Whatever it was, it must have been really good.\" She laughed a bit to herself. \"Do you all want a bath or are you content with smelling like cunt for the next few days?\"</span></div></div>",

She had more room for error when torturing them by crushing or impalement. \"That's alright, though. I dunno where that spark of rebellion comes from, but I can <i>see</i> it!\" Anna's lips were parted wide, her eyes wild with revelry. She looked like she had completely forsaken her sanity. \"Every time that little spark comes, I crush it. Every time it comes back, it's a little dimmer.

I-I-I mean, you l-like me, right?\" Her eyes flickered with understanding, giving Dan a newfound surge of hope. \"Yeah...\" He let out a weak, breathless laugh. \"Yeah...

She rather callously dumped him into his temporary home. His new clothes and possessions followed, more gently. \"I'll bring you supper in a little bit, alright? Anything in particular you want to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nope...\" Dan trailed, waiting for her to leave. Anna turned and left soon after being shut down by him. Dan stared aimlessly at his pile of new clothes before grabbing a pair of boxers, socks, and jeans, quickly changing out of his humiliating piss-stained clothes. Something glimmered in the middle of the pile. Glassy. Rectangular. Electronic. It was a phone. Finding it had battery, a familiar background confronted him, with a password he managed on the first try. It was <i>his</i> phone. Maybe <i>they</i> had given it to her after she had claimed \"ownership\" of him, rather than just discarding it. Ultimately it didn't matter how she came to claim it, just that it was here now. His insides leapt for joy when he realized that against all odds, on what may as well be another planet, he received service.

I understand!\" He shouted, half-sobbing from the thought he was about to meet his own death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who did you call? Cops? Army? National Guard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-No! No, no! I--!\" Dan continued, breathless and strained from vertigo and trying to right himself, \"I called my parents!

I said--I... said, <i>There's no way in hell the police could figure out where I am, no matter how hard they tried.</i> I-I...\" Dan whimpered. \"<i>I just wanted to hear my mother's voice again...

Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I don't know, maybe?!\" Dan stammered. <i>He hadn't hung up before he screamed... Oh, his poor mother...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Great...\" Anna lowered Dan back into the drawer. He immediately sucked down as much air as he could. His diaphragm ached. His legs were painfully sore. \"Give me the phone.\" She commanded, laying her hand against the bottom of the drawer expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"B-But... I...\" Dan gripped the phone protectively in his hands. <i>This was his lifeline to the outside. He didn't want to give it away...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dan. Give. Me. The phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I...\" Dan reluctantly placed the phone in her hand. <i>He would make his inevitable punishment that much worse if he refused...</i> \"I'm sorry...\" Tears rolled down his cheeks. Anna flinched. Dan's eyes widened, but he diverted them to the floor, ultimately deciding it would be best to ignore what he just saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just... Never do this again.\" She lifted the phone out of the drawer, careful not to damage it in any way. \"...nd... If you behave, I might give the phone back later.\" Dan's mouth fell open, quickly curling into a smile of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"R-Really? You mean it?! Th-Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It would be monitored, of course. That's not a problem, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-No, not at all! Th-This is--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good. Don't think this means you've gotten out of a punishment, though. And <i>don't</i> make me regret allowing this. Because if you do, I <i>will</i> break this phone into a million pieces and I'll be the only person you'll ever hear or see <i>again</i>, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh. And one last thing. If anyone shows up here in some misguided rescue attempt, I'm holding you <i>personally</i> responsible.\" Dan jumped at that. Anna, meanwhile, gently slid Dan's phone into a small sparkly cardboard box which contained a few of his other belongings. \"What would be a suitable punishment for you? I could break your legs...\" Dan sat down, curling his legs tightly to his chest. \"I could make you stand outside in the snow and count to 10,000... You wouldn't run, snow's too deep for that. Hmm... Do tinies have sex toys?\" Dan was sweating bullets. He considered the least damaging thing he would be willing to do to appease her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I... I could eat you out again...\" He offered shakily. \"Y-You could get me off just like last time but not let me cum...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I have an idea...\" Anna walked out of Dan's sight and unzipped a tote bag, retrieving a long, black drawstring pouch. Inside the pouch was a ribbed wand made of pure glass. She roughly grabbed Dan, forcibly stripping his clothes as he whimpered and yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I could have done it myself...\" He quietly complained under his breath. He found himself slammed against the glass for that comment. \"Ow! That really--ugh!\" She contorted Dan's arms behind his back to the point they threatened to pop from the shoulder joint. After getting his wrists to touch around the circumference of the dildo, she secured him in place with a small rubber band. Dan screamed, only to have a mouthful of flesh quickly silence him. It felt like his shoulders were nearly torn off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please don't scream. I thought we had moved past this.\" She hushed him gently, affixing his ankles in the same manner. \"No one is going to hear you, so I'd rather you not give yourself a sore throat for no reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This really hurts...\" Dan mewled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well obviously. It wouldn't be much of a punishment if it didn't.\" She slid her legs open, leaving Dan staring up at the naked white ceiling. \"You're gonna fuck me good and hard, understand?\" Dan closed his eyes, silently resigning himself to his fate. \"Hm... <i>actually</i>, I've got a better idea.\" Anna dangled the glass wand upside down as she walked. Dan was still attached to the wand. \"Come on, we're going on a little trip.\" Picking up a plastic box just big enough to fit the dildo inside, she wandered out into the backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The yard was covered in a solid two feet of crunchy snow that barely yielded when Anna threw the box onto it. Dan was placed inside. The bright blue sky spread across the entire world only served to mock him. His ears perked up at an ear-grating sound that he could feel in his teeth, like someone was dragging a shovel across concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you doing?!\" The fear and trepidation was incredibly evident in his voice as he watched her shovel away piles of white powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...\" The shovel hit the nearly frozen ground with a thunk, picking up a solid mass of earth, \"As you can see, I'm digging a hole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Why?! What for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You'll see.\" The overturned dirt piled up quickly, soon leaving a two foot hole in the ground, not including the mountain of snow that would be piled on top of it. The box was pushed none-too-gently into the hole. \"If my math is right, you'll have eight hours of oxygen, max. I'd advise you don't panic, and try to take shallow breaths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I've heard a lot of people have a fear of being buried alive.\" She started to slid the box's cover over it. \"So, do you? Screaming but no one can hear you. Dirt bearing down on your chest. Feeling precious air slip away with every breath, the stifling carbon dioxide making you choke... Buried alive... Must be pretty awful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"D-Don't--Don't... Don't do this!\" Anna gave him a small smile and rubbed herself through her jeans, like she was getting off on his fear. Nausea pulsed through him, he knew that was exactly the case. She'd touch herself tonight to the thought of Dan alone, scared, and screaming. She clicked the top of the box into place. The top was clear, so Dan could be tormented with shovel after shovel of dirt taking his light away in his premature--possibly permanent--burial. His scream was tortured and ear-piercing. It was <i>so</i> loud, by the time she had covered the entire hole and was preparing to pack down the dirt, Anna could still hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"SHUT THE FUCK UP!\" She snapped, firmly stamping the hole. The scream broke down into silence. She piled the snow on top. It was freezing outside. With Dan successfully buried and silent, Anna dragged the shovel to the garage, anxious to get back in the house to relieve herself.</span></div></div>",

Dan couldn't get his wrists undone from the straps holding him down. Even if he could, he wouldn't be able to escape. Two feet of dirt on him may as well be closer to thirty. He was stuck. Dan screamed in frustration and fear, beginning to hyperventilate against his better judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"God... She's finally gotten bored of me and this is how I die...\" He wept, shivering violently. Dan's tears froze on his face. He could feel the subzero temperature in the cores of his teeth. His lips, fingertips, and toes had long gone numb. The glass, giving him no insulation, only made matters worse. \"Haha... Hahahaha... Gh... I really fucked up this time... But y'know what?\" Dan said, quietly to himself, \"I don't regret it. No, I... I'm glad I called. Sh-She would have done this anyway, I bet... Yeah... She wouldn't have stopped. Twisted fuck...\" Dan imagined her sprawled across her bed, fingering herself to orgasm as she imagined him trapped, alone, and afraid. He imagined his mother, sobbing in the arms of his father and gripping the phone white-knuckled while his father tried to convince her to call the police. Ice-cold air prickled his skin and Dan even began to imagine Anna's tights, where it was at least soft and warm. He could have stayed there, he could be wrapped up in fleece, comfortable and toasty. Instead, he had chosen wrong. <i>Yes. That was the truth.</i> Dan thought. I made a choice and I chose <i>wrong.</i> Dan struggled with the straps again, hoping to at least be able to soothe the cramps in his limbs and curl up to conserve body heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally with a <i>snap</i>, the rubber band broke against his skin, cutting into his wrists and leaving a thin trail of blood along the glass. His legs quickly followed. Dan sighed with near orgasmic relief as he let his arms go limp and let his muscles relax. Dan traced his tongue around his wrists, collecting up the blood and swallowing it. He curled into himself and his teeth chattered. Would he even make it until morning? How long had he been stuck in here? Dan suddenly had an extreme case of claustrophobia. Stale air weighed on his chest. <i>I can't breathe... I'm going to die, I can't breathe...</i> The darkness and weight started to smother him. It felt like he was breathing nothing but clots of the surrounding dirt directly into his lungs. Dan coughed up mud. The sound of worms crawling outside reminded him how deep down he really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There's no way she'd... actually do this... No. No, no, no....\" He ran his fingers through his hair. \"There's no way she'd actually... Leave me here to die, no. She's-She's too <i>obsessed</i> with me to <i>actually</i> let me die in here.\" Dan reassured himself. \"Yeah... Yeah. Just have to make it until morning and she'll come get me. Yeah. She'll come get me... He drifted off to sleep with the quiet notion that he may not wake up again. \"<i>Save me, Anna!!!</i> PLEASE! SAVE ME!\" Dan woke up screaming in the dark, unabashedly begging for comfort from the only person he'd had contact with in who knows how long. \"Anna! Save... S-s-save me... Anna... Please...\" His hands wouldn't stop shaking, not even as the light cracked through the box, nor when his frozen stiff form was rattled around. Anna tucked him under her arm and took Dan inside. \"Th-Thank you... Thank you <i>so much</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mornin', sleepyhead.\" She said in that same shy tone as always, placing Dan into a warm sinkful of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-Wait, what if I have hypo--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don't have hypothermia.\" Dan moaned quietly as her fingers ran over him, soothing his frost-covered body and aching muscles. \"You can't <i>get</i> hypothermia. Just trust me. And if you did? You'd already be dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...\" Dan rubbed his stiff shoulders. \"U-Um... It...\" <i>Don't say it. Don't say it. Don't you dare--</i> \"It felt really good when you sort of... massaged me like that... I-If you wanted to, you could--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's this all of a sudden?\" She cocked her head. \"Thought you said you hated me. \" <i>I do.</i> Dan meekly shrugged his shoulders. <i>Filthy traitor.</i> \"That time in the ground really freaked you out, huh?\" Before he could think, his head bobbed up and down and he started to daydream about Anna's home-cooked food and her soft, warm tights to sleep in... \"Well, we can fix that, okay?\" She carried Dan off into her room after drying and dressing him. She placed him sitting on top of the dresser. \"Okay. You ready? I've been planning this for a long time...\" She unwrapped a tiny 1/2 inch needle normally meant for a mouse. She hoped this size wouldn't kill him. A tiny clear drop of liquid sat in the base of the syringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What is that?!\" Anna pinched Dan's arm and forced him down. \"<i>What is that?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Stop squirming.\" She commanded firmly, jabbing the needle into soft tissue and depressing the plunger. \"Now sit still. What's done is done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wha... What is that? What're you doing to me?\" Dan sobbed and slumped over where he was sitting. There was no point in fighting back now. It was already inside him, pumping its way through his bloodstream and working its dirty magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wouldn't tell you, of course, but they'd hardly notice it's missing. For a tiny guy like you? It took a few drops for a regimen of a few weeks.\" Dan couldn't help but feel like she was bragging. \"Oh! Looks like we're almost there!\" Dan was finding it hard to keep his eyes open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wh-wh're...y'...gon'... d'..t'me...\" Dan slurred out before he collapsed. Anna propped him up against a book and wondered how she could hypnotize him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, if she was going to play the role of a goddess, she had at least look the part.  Her pale skin and under-eye shadows stared back at her in the mirror. <i>For all Dan knew, she was a goddess of death.</i> She slid a long sleeved maroon top over her head. The flared sleeves covered her hands. A grey skirt found its way up her thighs, its hem coming to rest at her knees. Then came the thigh-high black and grey striped socks. <i>He\u2019d be begging for the opportunity to watch her strip, his own private little peepshow of enormous proportions. He\u2019d kiss the fabric of her socks and cry for her to remove them so he could taste her flesh. </i> She briefly ran a mental note of a few songs she could strip to. Finally came the finishing touch: a pair of calf-high black leather hunting boots. Laces criss-crossed all the way to the top and the thick tread made the ground tremble beneath it. <i>Perfect</i> for crushing disobedient little boys\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She had placed Dan on the floor. It seemed appropriate that once he came back to lucidity, he would see her at her true size. Maybe that would really hammer in the \u201cgoddess\u201d aspect. She looked down at him, prone between her boots. <i>She could squash him right now\u2026 No. It wouldn\u2019t be any fun if he didn\u2019t know what was going on...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dDan?

You\u2019d squelch under my foot like the insolent little nothing you are. And yet you show me such disrespect? Is that all you\u2019re good for? Huh? Being crushed?\u201d She added a bit more pressure. It was so dangerous. His body could pop any second now\u2026 but it didn\u2019t. Instead, Dan found himself fully entombed in her boot\u2019s tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dPl---Forgive me!\u201d He choked out. She slowly lifted her foot.

I\u2026 How could I forget I\u2019m in the presence of a <i>goddess</i>? Thank you for not crushing me.\u201d Dan said rather eagerly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t blame you for wanting to.

Yes <i>of course!</i>\u201d Dan gasped. \u201cOf course I know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dGood. Show me. Show me how much you love me.\u201d She tentatively flexed her toes. \u201cLie down.\u201d Dan flatted himself on the ground without hesitation. His eyes traced up her legs and stared at her black panties under her skirt. <i>He wanted nothing more than to be in there...</i> His vision was quickly blocked by grey and black stripes. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Anna slowly settled her foot on top of Dan. Dan\u2019s senses were overloaded with sweat and grime, along with traces of a sweet lotion. Gently gripping Dan with her toes, she idly played with him. \"Hhh\u2026 is this really all you\u2019re good for?\u201d Dan swallowed a mouthful of sweat. His mouth burned with its acrid taste. Dan managed to keep it down out of sheer respect. It was a gift, and should be treated as such. The damp fabric stuck to his skin and fully soaked his clothes. He had no scent of his own. It was all hers. As Anna pulled her foot away, she took her body heat with it. The sweat on Dan\u2019s skin instantly evaporated, leaving him even colder than before. He shivered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dPlease\u2026 I\u2019m so cold, I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dYou think you\u2019re worthy of touching me again?\u201d Dan didn\u2019t respond. <i>He wasn\u2019t.</i> \u201cWell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dN-No, but--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dThen what made you think I\u2019d let you?\u201d Dan looked completely heartbroken. After a brief pause, she asked, \u201c\u2026 Who do you belong to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201d\u2026 Y-You?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dIs that a question?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dYou. I belong to you.\u201d Dan changed his tone to one more affirmative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re <i>mine.</i> Mine to play with. Mine to control.\u201d She raked her toes over him. Dan shuddered in ecstasy. <i>She was so above everything. He couldn\u2019t begin to comprehend what her life was like. He was truly nothing, just something to be kept underfoot as a momentary distraction or a toy for her enjoyment\u2026 He\u2019d even die by her, if that\u2019s what she really wanted...</i> \u201cDan?\u201d <i>She said my name...</i> Pure, undiluted euphoria spread from Dan\u2019s core to the tips of his fingers and toes. <i>She said my name...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dY-Yes?!\u201d Dan peeped. She lifted him into her hands. <i>She\u2019s touching me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dI need you to wait in here for a little bit, okay? I\u2019ll come back for you.\u201d Anna placed Dan inside his home. He took a look around himself, as if seeing it for the first time. <i>This place\u2026 Had he been blessed? Surrounded by her socks and panties, things that were up close and personal to her body, all day, every day\u2026 Taking in her scents\u2026 Her fragrance\u2026 Her love juices...</i> Dan found himself unable to stop staring, his lips parted in an exuberant grin. Suddenly feeling weak in the legs, Dan staggered over and allowed himself to collapse onto his bed. <i>This was the greatest...</i> He hastily peeled his shirt off and pressed it to his face. It smelled just like <i>her.</i></span></div></div>",

After all, you haven't heard it spoken in 26 years. You may take it back gradually. Begin to recognize it as I speak it, like a young child or a puppy. As far as you know, you were a human raised in the woods by dogs. You've never seen another human, much less something like me. The few words you had learned as a child you've never had to speak. I'll teach you to talk, okay? You walk on all fours like a dog, and make meaningless animal noises until I help you walk and speak properly. Your brain works on an infantile level, with the capabilities of a five year old child and a wild animal. And I've <i>just</i> found you. When I give the command, all of this will become the only reality you've ever known, okay? Dan's head rolled back. \"Now. Wake up. Embrace your new self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He fell forward, landing face-first with no attempt to catch himself. A low, quiet growl exited his throat as he picked himself up on all fours. He blinked a few times, taking in his new world with wonder. That is, until he saw her. His fingers scrabbled against the wood as he shrank back. <i>The fear in his eyes, it wasn't human fear. No, no... It was mindless animal fear, like the eyes of a doe confronted with the business end of a rifle.</i> She imagined if he had long ears and a tail, they'd be curled back and between his legs, respectively. Dan took a cautious step forward after so many minutes of her not moving. She reached out to test his limits. As her finger neared him, he reeled back, snapping and snarling. She stuck her fingers in her mouth and blew. The shrill whistle pierced Dan's ears, quieting him immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Stupid boy. <i>People</i> use their words.\" Dan's brow furrowed deep in concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"S-Ss...\" He sounded like a kindergartner attempting to read by sounding it out. \"Stu--pit boy.\" <i>Holy shit, it worked. All his intellect was gone. He can't even talk like a normal person anymore.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes. That's you, Danny. A stupid little boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dan...nee?\" He cocked his head. <i>Fucking with this little idiot was too much fun. I wonder how long this'll last.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's you! That's your name. Danny. At least, for now. You're my stupid boy, Danny. You did very good!\" Her excitement and happiness, not unlike a caretaker teaching a toddler to talk, was genuine, even if twisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...Good?\" He nodded, it seemed to be a word he recognized. Dan repeated softly to himself, \"I... good?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">January \u2588\u2588</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The scopolamine seems to have robbed him of nearly all higher functions. As it wears off, his intelligence may be given back to him in pieces. I'm not certain it will stay, given the vicious nausea and vomiting that come with it. A part of me wonders if he will recall this experience at all once the regimen is completed for my own curiosity. Perhaps if I enjoy it, I may keep him this way permanently. I predict, if he does remember the experience, I'll enjoy him begging to not be regressed in intelligence like that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-A</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She stroked Dan's head gently.

Dan smiled with pride, not picking up that she was laughing for all the wrong reasons. \"Mm... How about... \"Mother\"?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"M-Ma... Mater... Moder? M... Mo... Mother? Mother... MOTHER!\" He started to cry, viciously hitting his forehead with the heels of his hands. \"MOTHER!!! MOTHER!\" <i>He has some recollection of the importance of that word. It must hurt to not remember why...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey... Hey.\" Anna gently forced his arms to his sides. \"It's okay. You're okay...\" She rubbed his back and tried to calm him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mother... Mother...\" He hiccuped through sobs. He clung to her fingers for a modicum of comfort and let out a muffled wail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ssshhh... It'll be alright.\" When he had suitably settled down, Anna went back to the lesson. <i>Something less traumatizing. </i> \"Now say, \"I love you\". Tell me you love me, Danny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<i>15 days after initial injection</i>--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She hit \"record\", just in case she needed the emotional blackmail later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmm? Wha're these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"They're books, Danny. You turn the pages and the words make a story.\" He opened one, eyes carefully observing each word. \"I'm hoping you're able to pick up some words from this. I'm not sure you're able to fully take it in yet, it may look like a picture you don't understand. This reading may be a little advanced for you right now, but I'm sure--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Tell me about the rabbits, George.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wh-...

Or does his latent intelligence come back in small doses?</i> \"Do you know what it means?\" Dan shrugged his shoulders. \"Well, alright. You sit tight here, I'm gonna get you some juice, okay?\" Dan wandered over to a piece of paper. Not one of his \"journal entries\", but she had left those out as well, should he try to read them. She returned to Dan scrawling on the paper. \"Oh? What're you drawing?\" Dan gave her a lopsided smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look, look!\" he urged as he took his juice. On the page was a drawing of himself, simple. Balls for hands, rectangular body, blue dots for eyes. He was standing in a meadow. Blue sky, yellow sun, pink flowers dotting the grass. Next to him were three figures, a woman and man on the left and a woman on the right. Childish orange-crayon scrawl dictated who they were from left to right. \"FRANKIE\", a woman about Dan's age, with long dark hair and glasses. \"DAD\", an older man who resembled Dan but with white hair, \"ME\", Dan himself, and \"MUM\" an older woman with blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's very good, Danny. Mind if I keep it for later?\" Dan nodded enthusiastically, flattered. Anna slid it into the box with his other possessions.<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<i>\u2588\u2588 days after initial injection</i>--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why don't I ever see anyone else around here? Am I meant to be a secret or something?\" Dan looked up from his book. Dan's head cocked inquisitively. Her eyes went wide for a moment. Dan's stomach sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You really don't--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"S-Sorry, I'll...

It's a world where mothers can abandon their children in the woods. Filled with monsters who would take you away. So you stay in here. To keep you safe.\" She paused, waiting to see if he'd call her out on the lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your name.

His eyebrows furrowed in confusion. \"Mm...\" He hadn't heard her speak her name very often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My name is Anna.\" She pointed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Annie!\" He pointed to her, clapped his hands and beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure, that works.\" <i>Annie and Danny...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">February \u2588</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The drug seems to be wearing off. He now appears to have regained the intelligence of an 18 year old boy, though he is still lacking in some cases and fairly childlike. He also currently believes the false past I've imbued him with to be his \"real\" past. He doesn't appear to understand why we are radically different, though he accepts it as truth. It is not apparent whether such a regimen has any long lasting side effects, psychological or otherwise. He does not appear to suffer any apparent brain damage.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-A</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How did you find me?\" Dan looked up at her, putting down his pencil. A black-and-white rendition of an imposing forest of pine sat on the page. The trees were smudged slightly to give the area an ominous, storm cloud feel. A man, tiny in comparison to the trees, stood with his back to the viewer. He gazed up, up, up into the forest, as if it were going to swallow him whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You said that outside, a mother can abandon her child in the woods.

I was taking a walk one day, and I found you. You thought you were a dog. You acted like one, too.\" She rubbed his hair. You were like a little bastard wolf. But I brought you here.

Like you were supposed to be from the start.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you...\" Dan mumbled with seemingly genuine gratitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're very welcome.\" Anna patted his back and let a sly smile grace her lips. \"I love you so much, Danny.

He didn\u2019t remember drinking, though, or even going to bed. The light sent a surge of pounding pain through his skull as he cracked his eyes open. <i>Wait a second\u2026 These aren\u2019t the clothes I went to sleep in. At least... I don\u2019t think...</i> Dan cringed in disgust when the vomit began to seep through the fabric of his shirt. He hurriedly pulled off the dark grey zip hoodie and fumbled his way out of his black t-shirt. He prayed Anna wouldn\u2019t be too upset about his getting puke on the floor. Maybe he could mop it up before she noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With his chest now bare, he took a closer look. No, there was no way he had fallen asleep in this. He would remember if he did. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d even accidentally fall asleep in converse and jeans. The only logical explanation is that Anna had changed his clothes at some point. But why? At least he was back in the drawer with actual sources of heat and comfort instead of buried in the backyard. Dan briefly glanced upwards and caught sight of her coming. His eyes darted around in panic and he fought nausea as he frantically scrubbed up vomit with his already stained wolf-print shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dI-I\u2014I didn\u2019t mean to, I swear!\u201d Dan blurted. \u201cP-please don\u2019t be mad at me, I didn\u2019t mean to--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dI know, baby...\" She said with a perverted sweetness. \"So, how\u2019s the headache?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dH-How did you know I...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dI know lots of things, Danny.

Real-Dan covered his mouth as the exact picture he was holding came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dNo...\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re-You\u2019re lying, you have to be, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dFrankie\u2019s her name, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Dan nodded dumbly. \u201cSo what\u2019s it a nickname for?

I had made a deal with myself earlier. I think you\u2019ll want to hear it.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI can put you right back into that state whenever the fuck I want.

What if we dialed them up right now? I\u2019m sure they\u2019d <i>love</i> to meet me.\u201d Dan shuddered to think of how this monster cunt would break down his mother and father using words. \u201cLet\u2019s make it a game! You give me their number, and I\u2019ll call.  I\u2019m good at pretending, you\u2019ll see! You\u2019ll be getting me off, or under my ass. Your parents will never be the wiser! C\u2019mon it\u2019ll be funny, and\u2026 kinda sexy... having somebody on the phone have no idea you\u2019ve got their precious little boy buried under your ass...\u201d She scraped a fingernail under Dan\u2019s chin and pulled out her phone, \u201cNow...  Give me their number.\u201d Anna slipped off her jeans and reclined on the bed, pushing her panties to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dNo... I-I...

A faint ping came from Dan\u2019s mother\u2019s end. The horrific scream that followed was indescribable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dD-Dan, Daniel, Wh-what--\u201d She was having trouble forming words through tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"D-Don't listen to her, <i>please...</i> Don't listen...\" Dan wailed. \"Don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dI fuck Dan every day whether he wants it or not.\u201d Anna taunted, her voice unhinged and raspy, as though she had been taken over by a demon, \u201cHe does what I say, because if he doesn\u2019t, <i>he dies!</i> Even today, right now, he begged, <i>pleaded</i> with me to stop, but I didn\u2019t. You know what his calling you\u2014you know what that punishment was?! I buried him alive. He almost froze to death, alone and afraid. Ahaha! Another time I almost crushed him to death under my cunt! I almost cracked all his ribs and smushed him right into paste! Dan spends every single night in my underwear drawer wishing he were dead. Crying for you. <i>Begging</i> for you. \u201cMommy, mommy please save me!\u201d\u201d Anna mockingly sobbed. \u201cHah! Some man you raised... He\u2019s crying like a little bitch right now, as a matter of fact. He\u2019s gonna spend the rest of his pathetic excuse for a life as my slave, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it! And now? He\u2019s about to start worshiping the ground I walk on, because if he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll personally round up your entire family and have my fun with all of you. And the last time you ever see little Danny alive again is right before I send you squirming down my throat. Hey... hey\u2014If you think that first picture was bad, <i>just you wait... </i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dSomeone\u2019s going to find you.\u201d Dan\u2019s mother\u2019s voice shook with rage. \u201cI\u2019ll send them out myself.

He didn't care about how risky it was. He just <i>wanted, and wanted, and wanted</i>, and sucked all his loved ones down into a pit they couldn't escape from. Isn't that awful?\" Anna idly twisted the ball of her foot as she hung herself over the drawer. \"So that's why I'm going to do this. To prove a point. To both of you.\" A thin, wicked smile spread across Anna's lips as the air filled with the hysterical incoherent cries and Dan's maddening screams of impotent rage, helplessness, and terror.</span></div></div>",

God knows we're never gonna see them again...\" Dan moved his lips quietly, \"They probably think we're both dead. Losing both kids in the span of a couple months...\" His face twisted into a scowl of teeth-cracking rage, \"How could she do something like this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, wait. As much as he wanted to, he couldn't entirely place the blame on her. It was all of them. Their entire system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dan?\" That unforgettable voice, forever ingrained into his mind, asked from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A soft whimper of terror croaked from Dan's throat. Frankie began to scream, but quickly clamped her hand over her mouth before it reached fruition. She gripped Dan tightly and he reacted in kind, both attempting to cover the other's weaknesses. Dan had Frankie in a death grip, muscles trembling with its ferocity. His entire body locked into a rigid state, refusing to move in the slightest no matter how much he was poked or prodded. It seemed to be an involuntary action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The fabric of Frankie's jeans grew damp with tears dripping down the decline of Dan's face as he kept his eyes trained on the ground with fierce intensity. He refused to look up. No matter how their captor attempted to goad him into it, he resisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, no, no, no, not now, please, not now...\" Vivid recollection of an aching skull, bent ribs, unwanted sexual conduct, agony, anguish, terror, tore into him over and over and over and over in his head with every throb of his pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dan...\" Anna pouted rather theatrically, nearly mocking him, \"You said if I spared your sister, you'd love me as much as I wanted, remember? Or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan shuddered. Her tone twisted into something more hostile, her gaze more disgusted and accusatory as though she were looking at disease-ridden vermin, not her beloved pet boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Were you <i>lying</i> to me?\" She drew out the word \"lying\" in a choking hiss. \"Ooh... I don't like liars...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N... No! N-No, no! I wasn't lying! I wasn't lying!\" Dan rushed out with a trembling voice crack that left it out in the open how scared he really was. \"I wasn't lying! I...\" Dan struggled to catch his breath, \"I just--I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Spit it out. Or am I gonna have to turn you into a mindless dog again?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ijustwasn'tready!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You weren't ready? You weren't <i>ready</i> to love me?\" Anna snorted derisively, laying her palm down on the floor of the drawer. \"Well you had better be ready now. I don't like liars, and I especially don't like waiting for immediate promises to come to fruition. I'd think you'd be more diligent about your end of this, considering what's at stake...\" Her gaze shifted to Frankie for a split second, but it was all Dan needed to be spurred on. He hastily pushed her onto the giant hand. Dan clenched his fist so hard his knuckles popped. As he and his sister were slowly raised out of the drawer, Dan's hand uncurled. All his hate... Anger... Strife... He drew his arm back and slapped Anna with everything he had left in him. Its sharp sound resonated through the empty room while its sharp sensation stung the palm of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Keep away from my sister you f--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don't think before you act very often, do you?\" Anna placed a fingertip on Dan's head and shoved him backwards. \"You brought your sister here, became a liar who lies about lying... No wonder no one but her came to rescue you, you're garbage. You don't slap someone you swore to love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I... I'm... so sorry.\" Dan hesitated just a moment. \"I will love you. Forever, until the day I die. However you want. Th-that <i>is</i> what I promised, after all...\" He murmured under his breath, \"and I... I don't have much of a choice now, do I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, you don't!\" She grinned wide. \"I'm your source of food, water, entertainment, medical care, hygiene, and toilet privilege. So unless you want to live as a lice-ridden mangy toothless vermin, <i>stay in line.</i> We're gonna have some fun now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan's face blanched and he broke into a cold sweat as his memories of the last time they had \"fun\" came flooding back. He reached over and squeezed Frankie's hand protectively. Dan held her tight as they were carelessly dumped onto the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's she gonna do to us?\" Frankie whimpered. A strangled moan of discomfort exited Dan's throat as he bit his lip as hard as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm bored. Distract me.\" Anna laid on her stomach and kept her attention on the computer monitor in front of her. Dan and Frankie remained stranded on the other end of the bed near her feet. She paid them no mind, not like they could get very far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"... What do you want us to do?\" Dan mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I dunno. Figure something out.\" Anna idly flexed her toes. An electric bolt of pleasure shot up her leg into her pelvis as a pair of tiny hands pressed into her foot's sole. \"Nnh... the fuck are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dan didn't respond, giving Frankie a small nod to follow his lead. A sharp exhale came from above as their captor dug her fingers into the mattress and buried her face in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hh... It... f-feels... Hah... It... feels... so... nngh...\" Anna's toes squirmed and a small damp patch seeped through her panties. \"D-Don't... Don't stop...\" She bit her hand, attempting to keep it in. \"O-One of you is gonna... Nnh--have to come up here an...d--ahn--finish me off.\" Her fingers clawed the bedsheets in desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan and Frankie exchanged a worried glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-You can choose among yourselves but nnhh--hurry up or I'm doing it myself! I need it... so bad... I might just take both of you...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I remember you saying you'd definitely die at this height. Let's see about that, huh? Frankie, can you hear me? Are you still alive?\" A weak gurgle came from below. \"Hmm... That's strange. You'd think something as tiny as you would have a lower terminal velocity. Well...\" She nudged Frankie with her toe. \"I guess you can't win them all.\" Anna slid her big toe right on top of Frankie's chest. \"How should I do this, now...

The only reason he hadn't vomited was thanks to an empty stomach spanning how many days. He watched his sister's broken, bleeding body rise, high above his head, dangling by an ankle. Anna flicked out the tip of her tongue, allowing a long string of saliva to snap off and fall to the ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please...

She flicked her tongue out once, twice more, apparently very fond of an imitation of a cold-blooded snake. Dan buried his head in his knees as Frankie screamed so loud he'd never get it out of his head. Anna's soft slimy tongue molded around Frankie's upper body and sucked her into her mouth. With a slurp, a soft gargling of saliva, a steely expression, and a single hard swallow, Frankie's screaming, squirming form was finished. As she slid down Anna's throat, she thought only of her brother in her final, terror-stricken moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Grating silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"W-here's Frankie?\" Dan mewled, rising from his sunken posture. \"Where's Frankie?! <i>WHERE IS SHE?!</i>\" He screamed like a child too young to even comprehend death. Anna glanced up, snapped out of her stupefied demeanor. In a bone-chilling, smooth and even tone, she spoke what would be Dan's ultimate mental undoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She's gone.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The anxiety spread through his joints hadn\u2019t left yet, at this rate he was doubtful it ever would. Dan tentatively flexed his fingers, alternating between hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m still here\u2026\u201d Dan murmured pensively. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m still here.\u201d For all he knew, she had plans to rip his humanity apart and turn him into her living doll. A vision of himself desperately grasping her fingers, hanging a good hundred feet in the air as she stared at him longingly flashed through his mind\u2019s eye. He shuddered. He\u2019d be hers. Maybe weeks. Maybe months, maybe years, but the end was all the same. He\u2019d bend to her will because it would be all he had left. He would be broken down, bit by bit, until he was a hollow shell of who he used to be. Then she would take his form and shape him into something better suited for her needs. There wasn\u2019t a damned thing he could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSooo, is my little boy ready to get dressed?\u201d Anna giggled as she wrapped a towel around herself. Dan didn\u2019t reply. \u201cSure you are!\u201d She smiled, unscrewing a bottle and letting loose a torrent of foul smelling cream. Dan winced and resisted a coughing fit as the pungent chemicals invaded his senses. \u201cDo you want to do it yourself, or should I?\u201d Dan stared back catatonically. This was actually happening. Never, even in his wildest nightmares could he fathom something like this. \u201cSo that\u2019s a \u201cno\u201d, then? Alright.\u201d She dipped her pinkie finger into the cream and spread it liberally across Dan\u2019s body. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna look so <i>adorable</i>, you know?\u201d Her gushing, unfortunately, did little to ease his shame. She gathered a drop on her fingertip and offered it to Dan. \u201cHere.\u201d His brow wrinkled in confusion. \u201cI need you to get that cute little cock and balls for me. Well? Go on, take it!\u201d Anna urged. Dan did as he was told, silently applying the disgusting lotion to his most intimate body parts. His trembling lips parted ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy?\u201d He whimpered. It was a futile question, he already knew. But he wasn\u2019t satisfied. <i>He was her toy, and that was that.</i> But he wasn\u2019t. He was a person. He knew. He could walk and talk and love and hate just as well as she or any other assumed giant could. Yet he sat complacently in tepid water, waiting to be cleansed then dressed like a doll. And he hated it. Dan wouldn\u2019t dare to show it, though. If he did, she may double her efforts to break him or just throw him away like a forgotten piece of trash, then replace him with one who could be broken easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay, I think that\u2019s enough time.\u201d Anna brushed his question off with no hesitation, turning on the faucet so a stream of water was just barely flowing out. \u201cWash it off.\u201d Dan did as he was told, fighting back the nausea in his stomach. He observed the cream\u2019s removal with unease, watching hair fall off his body and into the sink in clumps. His legs were hairless. His arms, hairless. His crotch\u2026 hairless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cN-no\u2026 I\u2026\u201d tears slipped down Dan\u2019s cheeks as he ran his hands over his now smooth body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat worked really well!\u201d Anna commented. \u201cThere\u2019s not a hair on you!\u201d Dan felt himself blush as his humiliation crept into the marrow of his bones. She tossed a rag at him. \u201cDry off. You need to get dressed soon, before you catch a cold.\u201d Dan begrudgingly agreed. She shoved the outfit forward. \u201cI think you\u2019ll look <i>adorable</i>.\u201d Fighting back tears, Dan slid on the garter belt and stockings, clipping them together after a bit of difficulty. The lacy satin panties slid tantalizingly up his smooth thighs, cupping his cock and balls perfectly and conforming to his ass cheeks. He hated to admit it, but they felt amazing against his skin. Lastly came the dress. Dan pulled it over his head, shrouding himself in pink and white. He self consciously pulled down the skirt as far as it would go, which brought it to rest just above his thighs. The bottom of his panties and the tops of his garters were fully visible to everyone who would look at him. He blushed furiously and covered his face upon realizing this fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease\u2026 <i>no\u2026</i>\u201d he sobbed. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t wear <i>this\u2026</i> Wh-what if someone <i>sees</i>?\u201d His breathing grew raspy as he cried, anticipating the shame and embarrassment of being caught in such a state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCalm down. The only one who\u2019s going to see you is <i>me</i>.\u201d She callously disregarded his worries. \u201cNow finish dressing.\u201d His sobbing died down into a whimper while he fastened the white, ruffly pinafore around his waist with a bow. \u201cYou look great!\u201d Anna smiled. \u201cDo a little turn for me.\u201d Dan timidly twirled in place. \u201cCurtsy.\u201d she ordered, without missing a beat. He tucked his right foot behind his left, bent his knees a bit, and fanned out the skirt of the dress in his hands. \u201cGood~\u201d she purred. Dan detected something else in that word other than amusement in his humiliation. It was feral, a carnal desire,\u2026 lust. \u201cI think you\u2019ll make a sweet little maid, don\u2019t you?\u201d Dan trembled where he stood. \u201cWell, <i>I</i> think you will.\u201d She pinched Dan\u2019s ass gently, eliciting a yelp of surprise. \u201cSo <i>cute\u2026</i>\u201d she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease stop\u2026 I can\u2019t take it\u2026\u201d Dan hung his head and wished for it to all just go away. To his distress, he had no such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know\u2026\u201d she responded icily, chilling Dan to the bone from the sudden change in temperament, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it this way, <i>I\u2019ve got four nails with your name on them\u2026</i>\u201d Anna held them up. Although they were only about an inch long each, to someone of Dan\u2019s stature they appeared to be horrifying three foot long metal stakes. What she was planning to do with those\u2026 he didn\u2019t want to think about. Without so much as a twinge in his stomach, a half digested stream of bile, peanut butter, and sexual fluid cascaded from his parted lips as he gagged. Luckily for him it had missed his clothing completely, instead splashing against the once pristine rim of the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI-I\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry! Please, let me make it up to y-!\u201d Dan hastily apologized, fearing her wrath, only to be surprised when she cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s. Fine\u2026\u201d she trailed. Her face held little emotion. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have scared you.\u201d She scooped him up in her hand and gave him a piece of toilet paper. Dan wiped the vomit from his mouth as she walked back to her room, placing him on the night table. \u201cIf you want to sleep, I have other clothes to use as pajamas.\u201d Dan hoped it would be more masculine than what he was wearing. Hell, <i>anything</i> would be more masculine than what he was wearing. Something was hidden in her hands. They opened to reveal a pair of light grey leggings, a pink pullover hoodie, and rainbow socks. Dan sighed. At least they\u2019d be comfortable. \u201cDo you like them?\u201d Anna teased. Dan mumbled a reply. <i>When would this nightmare end?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I... I promise, I won't run...\" He whimpered as the gravity of his situation hit his brain full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good.\" She gave a half-hearted, unreassuring smile and continued her work as Dan laid motionless in terror. \"All done!\" she grinned, snapping Dan out of his stupor. All five toes on her right foot had a layer of peanut butter spread in between them. He crawled to her foot, his legs too shaky to support him. Anna placed her hands on her knees and leaned in, keeping her murky brown eyes trained on his tiny form. \"Well, go on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I... I can't, I...\" the thought was revolting to him, sucking dirty, linty peanut butter off sweaty, smelly toes that had been crammed in socks all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eat it.\" Anna's expression shifted to a neutral one, somehow more spine-chilling than if she were flat-out angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N... No! That's disgusting! You're disgusting!\" shouted Dan, revulsion overriding his fear. Her jaw tightened and she raised her foot in the air. Dan fell backwards and started hyperventilating, certain he was going to be crushed to death. Anna's foot came crashing down over Dan's body, pinning him beneath it and coming just short of killing him. The nauseating scent of peanut butter and foot stink filled Dan's sinuses when he found his head between her big and second toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lick. It. <i>Up</i>.\" Anna's teeth were clenched, her expression stern. Her lips curled into a perverted smile when she felt his tiny tongue lapping away like his life depended on it. \"Was that so hard?\" She asked sweetly. Dan was too busy trying to swallow without tasting to respond. Fetid sweat coated his entire tongue and made him gag. Dan constantly fought back vomit. He had a feeling that if he let it out, he wouldn't be set free to expel it properly and it would just find its way down his trachea, leading to him dying a painful, humiliating death by drowning in his own puke. So he choked it down. Through his own perseverance, the space between her big and second toes was finished. \"I'm letting you up now, so you can get to work on my other toes.\" She said, cautiously lifting her foot, \"Don't get any ideas. I'll crack your little skull wide open before you can even beg for mercy.\" Dan quivered as he crawled up her foot, deciding that taking the rest of the toes on from the top would be the best course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Anna observed her little footslave from above. He was one of the hottest men she'd ever laid eyes on, and seeing him splayed against and dwarfed by her feet was more than erotic to her. She would have never been able to snag a guy like him under normal circumstances, but he was hers now and she didn't care how she got him. He was totally at her mercy. She quickly did a calculation in her head. On his scale, Dan had to be at least 6 feet, maybe 6'1, but to her the difference was negligible given that to her he wasn't any taller than 2 1/2 inches. This meant, she thought, that were they on an equal playing field, he'd undoubtedly tower over her petite 5 foot frame. Her eyes wandered back down to the miniscule form trying in vain to pry her toes apart. <i> 6 feet tall...</i> A pleasant chill ran down her spine and that special something between her legs ached with need. She was snapped from her silent revelry when she realized the tickling sensation of his tongue had stopped. He had managed to get the space between her second and third toes pried apart and finished, but was now doubled over and heaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you need some help?\" She asked, not in a kindly manner, but rather a manner that suggested he was too stupid or weak to finish the task alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-No!\" He stated a little too quickly. \"N-No, no, I'm fine! I just need to--\" Dan was cut off by a heaving gag that he fought with all his might to swallow back down. Anna nodded in quiet understanding while her lips formed a soft, sadistic grin. The taste and stench of her feet had become too much for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don't like the way my feet taste?\" Anna dipped her first and middle fingers into the slit between her legs. \"Let me help you with that.\" Her fingers came out dripping with fluid that she quickly let dribble and splatter across her toes. \"There. They should taste better now. Get back to work.\" Dan took a deep breath and dragged his tongue across her flesh in slow strokes. It definitely tasted different now. Not better, but different. The salty, tangy taste of her fluid had overridden the disgusting sweat taste and changed the smell of the surrounding air enough that it was now at least somewhat bearable. He swallowed and tried to clear his throat. What Dan really wanted to do was cough, but he was afraid if he did, he'd throw up. Dan steeled his resolve. <i>One more left. Just one more...</i> He threw himself at it with reckless abandon and sucked down peanut butter as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm almost done...\" Dan murmured to himself. \"I'm almost done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay that's enough!\" Anna's fingers clamped around him. Dan frantically squirmed as he was plucked from her toes. \"You did a pretty good job, considering...\" she spread her toes apart and inspected in between each of them. \"You seem pretty upset to be parted from my feet, so I think maybe you should stay close. Hah! You little fucking freak...\" Dan's expression morphed into confused horror and he opened his mouth to protest, but it was already too late...</span></div></div>",

Dan shivered when she mentioned each potential fate. \"But you got somebody like me, who maybe, just maybe intends to keep you around a little longer... If I were you, I'd try to have a little more gratitude. In comparison to all that, this is basically a walk in the park, huh?\" His eyes closed tightly, Dan hugged himself in some futile self-comforting gesture.

Anna, getting no response, mentally shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I guess your life wasn't all that precious to you after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-no, I-I can... I can do it! I can do it...!\" He rambled in a panic. \"J-Just let me... Let me try... P-Please? Give me another chance, I can... I can be useful to you!\" Dan dropped to his knees, heaving. Beads of sweat and saliva dripped down onto the wrinkled flesh beneath him as his heart thrashed like an enraged animal in a cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm waiting...\" She added, annoyed. Dan, tears streaming down his cheeks in humiliation and disgust, slowly licked the salty orifice and took peanut butter mixed with his own tears, her ass sweat, and tiny smears of shit into his mouth. It took every fiber of his being to swallow it. He continued like that, slowly for a while, giving up another piece of his humanity with every drag of his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"G-g-god... I... I can't...\" he sputtered as he struggled to get the revolting taste out of his mouth. A massive fingertip careened down, crashing onto him. Dan cried out in terror as it tested the limits of his skull, shoving his face directly into her asshole. He squirmed frantically and grasped her finger in a hopeless attempt to have her let him go. Mucous coated his face while the stench of shit wormed its way into his head. Dan sobbed in terror. What if she didn't stop? What if he suffocated to death on her asshole? Or... Or even worse, what if she pushed him all the way in, using him as some sort of living dildo, and made him live the last minutes of his life smothering on methane in her rectum? \"Mmmph! <i>Mmmmmmmph!</i>\" He screamed in a panic as he struggled to get air. The only response it drew was her pushing deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god...</i>,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe farted quietly, sending a hot wave of rotten-smelling gas right into Dan's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan took a deep, swooping breath of oxygen when she pulled him from her hole. He swallowed, panting desperately for fresh air while she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you don't want me to do that again,\" she warned, \"you'll keep going. Understand? You don't stop until I tell you to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-Yes!\" He squeaked, still lightheaded from oxygen deprivation. Dan grit his teeth, determined to finish without hurling. Chances were if he did lose his lunch, she'd just make him clean it up with his tongue. As Dan entered a near dissociative state to finish his task, he briefly began to wonder just how fucked in the head a person had to be to enjoy having their most disgusting parts spit-shined by someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan lost control of his body, shaking violently, when he realized he was without a shred of doubt now in the possession of one of those people.  While he licked up rancid peanut butter mixed with traces of shit, Dan quietly wished he had the balls to mouth off to her. Maybe then at least he could be killed by her in a fit of rage.</span></div></div>",

Never blinking. And he was asleep, blissfully unaware in a state of incapacitation where she could have done whatever she had liked. Despite the fact that she could do so whether he was asleep or not, the idea that Dan would never see it coming unsettled him greatly. A body-encompassing shudder rattled his bones. \"<i>D-Don't</i>--!\" Dan pressed his fists firmly on his temples. \"Don't <i>do that</i>!\" He sucked in a deep breath through clenched teeth, a few hot tears running down his cheeks. \"Don't <i>fucking</i> do that!\" A single slender finger slid towards his body. Dan jerked violently away before it had the chance to make contact with his body. \"Don't <i>fucking</i> touch me, you freak monster cunt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe solid, unbreaking stare that followed chilled Dan to his core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Everything in my house belongs to me. You belong to me now. Do you <i>understand</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I--unh!\" Dan found himself being slammed to the table below, fully entombed by the fingers of her right hand. His trembling radiated slightly through the thin skin of her fingers. Dan's terror-stricken mind faintly registered in horror the similarity of his position to that of a disgusting bug right before someone slammed their hand down on it, putting an end to its pathetic existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you <i><b>understand</b></i>?\" Her eyes narrowed, jaw set into a scowl. Tears flowed freely down Dan's cheeks as he moved his lips in a silent prayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y... Yes.\" Dan swallowed with great difficulty. \"P-Please... Please don't kill me. I-I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm gonna let you up now, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"O... Okay.\" The fingers slowly lifted from his body, allowing Dan to cautiously sit up and take a much-needed deep breath of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't want to hurt you. You are my pet after all.\" She returned to a soft spoken demeanor before Dan lost his mind in terror. \"But. That doesn't mean I'm gonna put up with any of your crap. I'm the one in control here.\" Dan nodded obediently in complete, sheepish silence. \"For one, I'd appreciate if you didn't call me a cunt, get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay...\" Dan mumbled, slowly climbing to his feet. His eyes darted to the ground. \"I-I... I'm... sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Calling you a monster cunt.\" Dan continued sheepishly, staring at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good boy.\" She stroked his hair with her thumb. \"Oh!\" She giggled in satisfaction, \"You've already stopped resisting physical affection!\" Dan's face blanched before quickly turning into an intense blush. He had been so scared he hadn't put any thought into resisting her advances... \"I think that since you've been a very, <i>very</i> good boy so far, somebody deserves a treat...\"</span></div></div>",

You are at this time 17. Also, since I plan on continuing this story for a while, if a choice says reserved, <b>please do not add to it</b>, for I have many plans for this story</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the poorly lit room behind the counter of the slave auction, you could only watch as people came and went, taking all sorts of slaves for their own doings, however never choosing you. Like you could blame them; your perfect fur was all matted and dirty from the horrible conditions you were forced to live in, making you look like a worn mut compared to some of the newer slaves. However, from your spot you noticed a young woman, cape drawn over her as she entered the building. You had seen her once or twice before, taking a young rabbit and an older cat. As her eyes spied the backroom, you noticed a glisten in them, looking directly at you. She turned to the clerk, clearing her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...arctic fox is it? How long has she been here?\" she started, her voice calm and neutral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk snickered as he looked back at you. He was one of the worst there, having abused you multiple times, causing you to reflexively cower at the mere sight of him. \"Her? Pfff probably 17 or 18. Dirty old thing hasn't sold yet. Looking to buy her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman seemed to have noticed your movements, hearing her cough a few times as she returned herself, something being very off about her. \"Is that a problem? I could always go to the other auction in the next town, I'm sure they'd be happy to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa whoa, excuse me ma'am, I meant no disrespect to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not to me...anyway, yes I was looking to purchase her for my farm. May I...take a closer look?\" she mused, seeing her smirk a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why of course, come with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only watch as the clerk lifted the entrance to the back of the counter, watching her slowly approach. Her shadowed face looked up at you, a young hand reaching through the bars and gently petting your fur, causing you to twitch and move back a little bit. She gasped quietly beneath her breath, her hand pulling away as she looked at you, two blue eyes glowing from the hood. Her cape dragged across the floor as she turned to the clerk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will take her, name your price\" she announced firmly, catching the clerk off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Are you su-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I stutter sir?\" she said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stepped back, a cold sweat coming off his face. \"N-No of course mistress. Y-You can have her for two gold, d-does that seem fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw her reach into her pocket, tossing a few gold coins to the floor, the metallic ringing through the room. \"Keep the change, as a courtesy. Now, as for my slave....\" She turned back to you, unlatching the cage and taking your arm, looking quite forceful but in reality very gently gripping your chains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, you followed her out of the auction house, leaving a wordless clerk to collect his cash. As you came around to her carriage, she lifted you up into the back and joined you as it set off. Surprisingly, she undid your chains, the metal cuffs bouncing out of the wagon as she sat across from you, pulling back her hood to reveal her chestnut brown hair, flowing gently behind her as her soft face smiled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for taking you as crudely as I did, but I'd hate to have raised any suspicions with those slave traders. Now, my name is Jessica, but you may call me whatever you wish. What is your name my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely dumbfounded by the sudden shift in tone, you could only look back at the woman for a few moments before finally speaking.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wooden carriage bounced along the quiet woodland road as you looked as Jessica, her deep blue eyes looking at you with a warm wonder. You bit your lip for a moment, your cheeks turning rosy beneath the smudged dirt and grime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Celeste ma'am....\" is all you could say as your eyes dropped to the wooden floor. <i>Celeste</i>, a name you hadn't heard from yourself or anyone for so long, even before you were captured. It hurt to remember the past, all the torment you had gone through just to survive by your lonesome....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's hand came to your chin, raising your head gently as she rubbed your cheek, feeling yet another matted piece of fur. \"It's a beautiful name, perfect for such a beautiful fox like yourself. Please, if there is something you need to get off your chest, please say so. I will not hurt you, like those brutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel your fur go up on end as she finished, memories of your year with them flooding back. You almost cried as tears welled up in the corners of your eyes, wiping them away as you cleared your throat. \"I-I am sorry I...I just don't trust humans easily. It's been...very hard for me these last two years....\" that's when the tears really came out, your heart pounding in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celeste...\" she started again, taking your hands in her own, her tone becoming lighter and warmer. \"I understand...I've met many of your kind and I know what my kind have done to you poor things. Once we get you home, I hope you'll feel...well, at home\" she chuckled, rubbing the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the trip was rather quiet as you listened to Jessica talking, only replying when you could get yourself to. Looking out the window, you found yourself on a dirt road, much smoother than the woodland paths you had traveled, trees lining either side as fields opened up past them. The carriage stopped alongside an old stone cottage, decorated with a variety of flowers. It looked almost brand new thanks to how well kept it was. As you followed Jessica out, you heard the driver drop down, none other than the cat you had seen only a few months ago. A young calico in her mid 20's, she stood almost a foot taller than you, a hand on her hip as she wiped away a little sweat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, hope the trip wasn't too bumpy for you two\" she started. Quickly she noticed you, a little surprised. \"Eh I know you, don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I think so...Miss Jessica just purchased me\" you mumbled, blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I do know you! Well, Gen is the name. You're in good hands with Jess here\" she chuckled, turning to Jessica. \"I'll go get the horses back to their stables ma'am and I'll get started on dinner for the four of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good good Gen. Thank you\" she nodded, watching as Gen unhooked the horses and led them off toward the barn across the way. Jessica took your hand, leading you inside with a warm smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside was just as neatly decorated as she led you up the white stairs to the second floor, opening up the bathroom and leading you in. Two wooden stools sat off to the side inside the rather roomy bathroom, a large shower and bath and an assortment of cleaners and brushes all about. As you took a seat, she came over with a brush and scissors, sitting down behind you as she started to work your matted fur, humming gently to sooth you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Celeste, I am not like most slave owners. You and the everyone else here are my family, safe for as long as I'm here. I do have a farm, the slave dealers know that quite well, but I cannot ask of you to help just yet, not till you are more adjusted to our way of life\" she cooed gently, very careful not to pull on your fur too hard. \"I'm sorry if- oh dang, sorry , are you ok?\" she asked, having pulled a little too hard, causing you to tense up and groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes ma'am....just a little sensitive, but...I've been through worst\" you sigh, grabbing your arm, numb to the pain at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica didn't say anything more as she worked down your body, very careful now as to not hurt you. As the last knot was pulled out, she sighed, placing the tools away and coming around to you, helping you up. \"I am very sorry my dear. Get yourself cleaned up while I get you a new outfit, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, not saying a word as you held your arm, shy and very nervous. As she left, you took the old rags the slave owners had put you in, tossing them straight into the garbage, climbing into the large bath. Warm water poured from the faucet as you stepped in, falling back into the warm waters all the way up to your neck. It felt so luxurious, the warm water surrounding your aching body as you grabbed some soap, slowly working over your body with no rush at all. Bubbles formed on the surface of the water as you finished, taking another few more moments as you almost fell asleep. Just as you got yourself out and dried, you heard a knock at the door, Jessica peeking in before entering, folded clothes in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my Celeste, what beautiful fur you have. I think these should do you nicely, I'll just be outside when you're ready\" she said softly, handing you them and closing the door behind her. Indeed the sleeveless black dress with a small skirt fit your thin body quite well, your crystal white fur and tail highlighting it greatly. As you stepped out, Jessica was waiting, turning from the adjacent wall and looking at you, sparkles in her eyes. \"What do you think my dear, do you like it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am, very much so\" you replied softly, fixing the dress a bit as you looked yourself over, a small smile on your face for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica noticed this, beaming a little as she hugged you \"Come then, we can talk over some dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small, more confident nod, you followed her back down the stairs toward the dining room.</span></div></div>",

However, as Jessica sat down, you noticed someone else, a pair of long ears hanging off the side of their brown hair, wearing a dress much like yourself. A family full of girls? You could definitely get used to that, you thought to yourself as you sat next to Jessica, staying close to her and looking over at the bunny again. Their face...it didn't seem right to you, although you couldn't quite place it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were cut off as Gen, hands mittened as she carried platter in, set it down before the three of you, taking them off and sitting next to you, your long tails swishing into each other a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So everyone, as Celeste is a new member of the family, I would like to introduce ourselves\" Jessica announced, folding her hands neatly. \"As you know Celeste, I am Jessica, the human caretaker of this farm and, in a way, a mother of sorts for everyone here. Gen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat nodded, chuckling to herself \"And you've met me, twice now! I take care of most of the hard work around here, including the horses and the fields. I'm happy to have a new sister around here! Mentioning that... Jackie, would you care to introduce yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across from you, the rabbit's face blushed heavily, hiding behind their ears a bit as they drooped in front of their face. \"I-I'm Jackie, as Gen said. I take care of the smaller animals as well as cleaning and everything\" they said softly, peeking out from behind their ears before sighing, rubbing their sleeved arm shyly, looking at you with warm eyes. \"It's every nice to meet you Celeste. M-Miss Jessica, w-will she be staying with me then? I... I don't mind but...\" they drooped down a bit, flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy Jackie. I'm sure you'll be fine with Celeste, she's a very nice fox after all\" Jessica said gently, in the most motherly voice you had heard in forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around at the three, your heart pounding in your chest. This was going to be your family...\" T-Thank you all for having me! I.... I know I'm new around here but...I'll do my best as part of this great family!\" you said suddenly, covering your mouth as your face went bright red, overcome by the shock that you said all that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Gen's hand give you a firm pat on the back, hearing her laughing. \"That's the spirit Celeste! I knew you were my type of girl!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard your stomach growl, blushing a little. \"M-May we eat now Miss Jessica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human eyes beamed as she nodded encouragingly \"Of course! Please, let's all dig in to this feast Gen made us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jessica, I'm humbled\" Gen chuckled, rubbing the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith introductions over, first came the food. Cornbread, potatoes, ham, and eggs laid out among the vast varieties of food among the four of you, eager but polite hands taking some at a time, the glass dishes filling up quickly as the feast began. As you ate some of the cornbread and ham, you could feel your hungry belly filling slowly, a feeling you had not felt in forever. It was all so good, so fresh and filling. You could see everyone else at their meals too. Gen was rather ravenous with her dish, hungry from a long day of work outside. Jackie on the other hand only picked at the foods, eating slowly much like Jessica. In one day you went from being a caged animal to being a part of a family. It was almost a dream come true for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the platters slowly emptied and everyone finished the last of their food, you saw Gen coming around, collecting the plates and silverware and taking them all to the kitchen, Jackie joining her to help clean them. Jessica on the other hand moved closer to you, placing a hand on your lap. \"So Celeste, how was your meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It was quite good Miss Jessica. I've...never had something so good in such a long time. If I may ask...is there something I'm missing with Jackie? She doesn't seem that enthused about me staying with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Well... Jackie is a bit shy if you hadn't noticed and...just ask her tonight about themselves. You'll understand when she tells you.\" She gently leaned forward, patting your head gently. \"I'm glad you enjoyed your dinner. Tomorrow I'll show you around the farm, for now just head upstairs to the room. It's next to the bathroom, that's where you'll be staying. My room is at the end of the hall if you need me, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am. Thank you....ever so much!\" you leaned forward hugging her warmly, feeling her hands wrap around you as she nuzzled her head against your shoulder. \"Sleep good, I'll see you at dawn\" you purred, pulling away and nodding before heading up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you opened the door, it was quite obvious why you were staying in there, two beds on either side of the room across from each other. Each had identical dressers, desks, and closets on their respective sides, a look inside the closet revealing many more dresses and a nightgown, so perfectly hung for you. With Jackie busy, you were able to change into the nightgown and look around a bit more before you heard the creak of the door, the light brown haired rabbit coming in, blushing heavily. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the young bunny, probably a year or two younger than you, entered the room, their eyes looked everywhere except were you were on your side of the room. Their ears drooped as they headed toward their bed, seeing them peek over at you a few times before turning away, huddling away on their side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a little bit, you minded yourself, looking around in the drawers and occasionally take a second to look over at the bunny, sitting at their desk seeming to scribble notes or something in their book. As a naturally quiet hunter, you snuck your way across the room, peeking over their shoulder curiously. It was a diary of all things, their shaky hand writing about their day. Suddenly, the two bunny ears perked up, bouncing off your chin. Caught off guard, the bunny's head turned to look back, only to lose their balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Whoa wha-?\" they let out, very surprised as they wobbled in the chair, almost falling off. They brushed their hair back as they readjusted themselves, looking at you closely. \"C-C-Celeste?! W-What were you...d-doing behind me like that?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy blush covered your face, your eager tail now between your legs. \"W-Well....Miss Jessica told me to ask you about....yourself. I couldn't help but notice you were...a bit worried about sharing a room with me at dinner. I'd just like to know why\" you let out gently, sighing as you rubbed the back of your head. \"Sorry for scaring you, I just didn't want to interrupt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey blinked a few times, their eyes as wide as they could be in fear. Then, they sighed, their ears drooping even more as they lowered their chin. \"Celeste...I...I....\" they stuttered, their eyes tearing up in the corners of their face. Then, they felt your warm embrace as you came around, hugging them gently and keeping your head close as you listened, nodding firmly. They looked a little surprised, but nodded gently. \"Celeste...I'm not like you. I'm...a boy....\" he sighed, the tears in the corner of his eyes running down his face as the water works slowly opened, a gentle stream running down his face. He clung tightly to you, whimpering a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all made sense now, the odd look of his face and all of it. But...all you could do was think of this poor, crying boy hugging you tightly in your arms. You gently pet his head, humming with a gentle purr in your voice as you tried to sooth him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you felt his grip on you growing weaker, his crying turning into little sobs as he sat up, wiping the tears from his blurry eyes. His head still pointed downward, whimpering quietly. \"I...I didn't mean to lie to you but....while I am a boy I've always acted like a girl. I mean, this dress...\" he fluffed the bottom of it, sighing gently \"it just feels right to me...but when I let slip how I felt...many of my friends turned on me, beat me up and....one even tried to eat me....\" He whimpered some more, your gentle touch to his shoulder calming him down a little more. \"That friend...was a fox like you, so...it's a little hard not to remember it...but...you're different. You're so kind and...I don't know...Miss Jessica and Gen know but...I've never felt right talking to them all about...<i>this</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you listened to the boy's sad tale, you could only find yourself more and more taken aback by shock and yet also understanding his pain. While you didn't go through what he did, growing up as a girl wasn't easy for you either, having been bullied many times due to your size and perceived weakness. As he finished, your hand came up to his cheek, rubbing it gently as you looked at him warmly. \"I understand Jackie...I promise, I will never eat one of my family, especially you. If I may...I could help you. We are sharing the same room so...it's not exactly hard for us to have some privacy. But only if you want me to, I understand if you ca-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were suddenly cut off as you felt him practically leap into you, hugging you tightly. \"I...I...I'd really appreciate that. Thank you...for understanding. I think I can...put the past behind me...for you\" he said gently, his teary eyes clearing as he looked up to you, his amber eyes staring into yours. \"I...I think it's time we head to bed. We can talk about this more tomorrow....thank you.\" He slowly pulled back, nodding gently as he rested his arms atop his legs, smiling for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're more than welcome Jackie. Here let me just...\" you reached for his hair, curling it with your claw back into position \"there we go, can't have my new friend all messy before he goes to bed\" you winked, standing up with him. \"I hope you sleep better now that we....figured this all out. I'll just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" he cried out, grabbing your hand stop you. \"C-Can we...sleep together? Rabbits tend to sleep near each other and...\" he trailed off, blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. Of course Jackie\" you giggled, turning back to him and taking his hands in your own. As the young bunny crawled up in the bed, he watched you very closely as you followed. A heavy draft blew through the window, causing the bunny to shiver. With your usually warm body, an idea quickly formed in your head, laying beside him and hugging him against you, wrapping your tail over his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yelped a little, eyes opening wide before relaxing again, nuzzling closer to you. \"Thank you Celeste...you must be an angel to have come here\" he giggled. \"Goodnight sister...sleep...good...\" he yawned, his body naturally curling up against you as he quickly fell asleep. Poor thing, he was so tuckered out he barely said goodnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kiss his head gently, curling your body around his in your warmth. It was....rather soothing to be honest. You remembered how your mom would do this when you were younger. It seemed you had turned into a something similar, a caring sister that wanted to protect your little bunny brother. With a warm smile on your face, you slowly drifted to sleep, your first real slumber in forever.....</span></div></div>",

What is that thing...?\" Alia, the curvy leopard secretary asked as her gaze travelled up the behemoth's frame. It was... ugly, to say the least. Mostly hairless, save for a frazzled brown mane coming from its head. It bore a bit of a resemblance to an ape, though it did not share the prehensile thumb on its feet. Currently the beast was forced to kneel before its captors, its wrists locked in place by heavy cuffs attached to chains, both forged from titanium. It's head hung low, shrouding its face with its hair.  Its crazed  brown eyes glinted beneath its mane and its lips parted to bare its feral teeth. Alia rapidly stepped back in horror. Dr. Matthews, standing confidently beside it, was no taller than its middle finger.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't worry, Alia.\" Dr. Matthews reassured her. \"She can't hurt you.\" He flipped through a notebook filled with chickenscratch along with various diagrams, \"They seem to be called hu-mans... odd name...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A-Are you sure?\" Alia asked, nervously eyeing the strained metal chains.<i> They could snap at any moment...</i> she thought.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course I am.\" He replied. Alia jumped as the beast flexed its wrists, a horrible metallic creak echoing through the room. The thing laughed a bit as it flexed again, pulling the chains from their supports in the floor. She was free. Finally free. The chains swung wildly as an enormous hand came down, knocking Alia and Dr. Matthews backwards. Alia screamed in terror. Surely death was upon them, she thought, as the monster's gaze tracked the pair's every movement...</span></div></div>",

He was chosen from his size, a slender rattus (anthro rat) with some muscles, but nothing series, over four, but less than five feet tall, with big ears, a fair size snout, gray fur, and long rat tail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Roger was having a difficult days Unlike some of her slave, Roger knew what it meant to be free, and was resistant to her training methods at first.  However,  Alexia has a wield, and deviant ways of dealing with her difficult slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, Roger..\"  Kristy stated as she walk about the bound form of Roger.  \"Are you ready for your punishment?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristy was a slave like Roger, but as Alexia's favorite, Kristy had special advantages over the other. slave.  Advantages that she really like to use on Roger.  Roger was Alexia's least favorite, something that could have gotten him hurt, or worse, but Kristy enjoyed his company too much for that to happen.  Roger still didn't know if that was a good thing or not.  The busty female rabbit was nearly naked, wearing only a loincloth that cover the her private area.  Roger tried to look away from the rabbit's firm set of breasts as he laid flat on his back on the table.  Thick, long stripes of leather easily restrained him, while Kristy just stood there, enjoying all this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Onks alive!\"  Roger cursed as  attempted to get free out his bonds.\"  It's your fault that vase broke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Roger,\"  Kristy sighed. \"You saying that bumping into that precious vase was my fault, even through I was nowhere around.  I was attending Mistress' errands at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger had walk around that hallway a thousand times.  While he was carrying more  than he was used to, there was no way he could has knock down that pottery,...unless..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway..\"  Kristen continued.  \"  Mistress Alexia say I can decide your punishment.  \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristy have him a triumphed smile.  \"This little slave is going to be your mistress for the next 10 days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristy's grins got bigger as she   climb up on the table, and straddle the bound form of Roger.  She went over his body until she sat firmly on his legs.   Kristy pull down on Roger's loincloth, pulling it through his restraints.  His newly revealed rat cock was soon firmly in her hands.   Kristy move is her hands up and down, making more and more erect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kristy, come on, \"  Roger plead. \"You know that Mistress Alexia doesn't like hard ons\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mistress doesn't like you boy all hot and bothered.  \" Kristy giggled as she move her paws up and down his cock.  \"She said it's embarrassing to see the loincloth \"tents\" from all the males all the time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if you don't tease us all the time.\"   Roger grunted as he felt himself getting close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you male just can't control yourselves\"  Kristy teased as she move even faster.  \"but if you need any help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristy stopped cold, and then hit Roger's cock and balls at the same time. He tried to screamed, but Kristy quickly cover the rat's snout quickly, so all that come out as a muffed groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There\"  Kristy said as she raised her paws and made sure that Roger was not going to say anything else.  \"I think that's enough.\"  She hopped over the table, look first at Roger's pained face, and then to his lower half, where, somewhat to her surprise, he was still erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what to do now\"  she mused to herself.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After getting dressed, you paused in front of the mirror as usual, running your hands up and down your body to smooth the little clothing that Sarah usually let you wear. Your fingers paused momentarily at the collar encircling your neck, and again you thought about how much better this thinner and more ornate collar was compared to the original larger and bulkier version you wore through most of your childhood. The little bell ornament hanging from it brought a slight smile to your lips as you lightly flicked it; it was a little something that Sarah requested for your collar, likely as an attempt at a little wit. Moving along, you hefted your breasts \u2013the upper pair first followed by the equally sized lower set \u2013 to adjust them in the thin sheer material of your top, making sure to show plenty of the double cleavage. After that, your hands fell to rest atop the swell of your hips, dexterous fingers lightly fluffing the thick and luxurious fur found there as well as across the rest of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spied the time in the reflection, whirling around to confirm that it really was that time. You gritted your teeth upon realizing that you had taken so long that you were running more than a bit late. Dashing out of your room, you set out in a steady jog through the palatial halls of your mistress\u2019 home. Along the way, you came across some of Sarah\u2019s other servants, and greeted them without breaking stride. A couple of them gave sly little grins and such, knowing that you were running late. Stopping outside the door, you ran your hands around your body again, helping to resettle anything that had shifted due to your hurried pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, you knocked on the door and waited for just a moment \u2013 hearing two voices beyond the portal, both of them familiar to you \u2013 before you heard one of the voices call out, \u201cCome in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened soundlessly, but the little bell charm at your throat made enough noise that no one could miss you stepping inside the room. Sarah glanced back at you for just a moment, her blood-red hair framing her pale face and the slight curl at the corner of her lips, before she turned back to the video screen. On the display was a woman you recognized as Sarah\u2019s mother, a woman who looked extremely like a slightly older version of her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it\u2019s all right, mom, I understand,\u201d Sarah said, her normally melodious voice turned a bit brittle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry darling, we can get together another time,\u201d her mother replied, then looking somewhere out of the camera\u2019s view, \u201cAnd it looks like your father is waiting for me. He sends his love too, ta-ta.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen went dark as the call was ended, and Sarah continued to stare at the blank display. Even without being able to see her face, you could tell that she was lost in thought. So you remained standing there as silently as you could, before she seemed to come back to herself and turn around to face you with a wan smile on her face, you then took a few tentative steps closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, mistress, I take it that your parents aren\u2019t coming for the birthday dinner tonight in that case?\u201d you said, bowing low enough that you thought your breasts might slip free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the party tomorrow too, it seems,\u201d she replied with a nod of her head.\u201d Her smile grew a bit more as she stepped closer to you, her soft breasts squishing into your own, \u201cGuess I\u2019ll just have to have some fun with you girls tonight then,\u201d her voice going a little sultrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, she lightly ran a finger around the heart-shaped patch on your thigh, which combined with her words to send a little shiver of anticipation down your spine and cause a bit of heat to build in your nethers. You closed your eyes as she continued to run her hand across your curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and what do we have here?\u201d her voice snapped you out of your trance-like state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping your eyes open, you saw and felt that she was talking about\u2026</span></div></div>",

Long black hair, tannish skin, wears a raggedy dress made from trash that's ready to fall apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Melanie. 15 years old, skinny, small breasts, short brown hair. A little immature for her age, she hated her life in the Tiny villages and hopes she gets a nice master. she was bullied by the other girls and was glad to see most of the teenagers who bullied her get bought by someone else. Optimistic about being enslaved, she's naturally submissive and weak-willed. Wears ragged panties and tries in vain to cover her chest with her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Celine. 16 years old, long blonde hair, normal sized breasts and butt. Celine was a rather athletic girl from the village and was training to join a hunting team. she is used to working on teams and is strong for a young girl, so she would make a stupendous slave. Skilled with knives as well as bows and arrows, she can take down rats and small snakes, but is far too weak to harm anything larger, much less a full sized human. Wears a crude white loincloth. Used to own a bra but it was destroyed when she was captured.</span></div></div>",

You received Lyra as a gift on your eighteenth birthday, now just over three years ago, and she had been your constant companion throughout that time. Normally, you would have turned down the present due to your dislike of the thought of owning a sentient being, but you decided that it might not be advisable to turn down a gift from the Empress herself, especially when she was a relation to you; distant thought that relation it may be. You still thought that the gift of Lyra wasn\u2019t anything sincere, but rather just an overt way to show that her Highness wasn\u2019t discontented with your father\u2019s indiscretion with one of the family maids. She most likely had no real feelings towards you or perhaps even any actual knowledge of you past that supposed show of good faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the years, you had grown to enjoy Lyra\u2019s presence, though you often tried to treat her as more of an equal than most people treated the so-called \u201clesser anthros\u201d that weren\u2019t the offspring of a human father and were often relegated to menial or demeaning tasks. Your personal stance on the slavery of the genetically created beings made it all the more troublesome when your mind returned to the thought of your latent feelings towards Lyra. There was little denying your attraction to her, but a portion of your mind rebelled against the idea any time it came up, fearing that you might start treating her like your personal sex toy or something, as how some people treated their servants. All of the time that you spent with her only cemented your feelings towards the lighthearted and compassionate woman. She always seemed to laugh at your jokes, and it felt like she actually enjoyed your humor, rather than putting on an act just to please her mistress The fact that you found her so attractive helped; she was such a pleasantly\u2026</span></div></div>",

The bloated cow let out another small gasp, but nothing else following your command to not to speak until you said so. Drawing the crop back, you flicked it forward again, a fraction harder this time. Eve shuddered from head to toe, causing her bare flesh to jiggle for several moments. You started to hit her with a regular rhythm, though you varied the strength of each blow. She occasionally let out a hiss or a small cry, but never a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally stopped, your arm was sore from the shock traveling back up the leather tool, but it was worth it. Moving around in front of your pet, you saw that she was blushing furiously with a grin dimpling her flesh cheeks. You could smell her arousal mixing with your own as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you enjoy that as well, my pet?\u201d you asked, though you knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to open her mouth but quickly stopped and instead nodded her head vigorously. You returned her smile before reaching up and digging your fingers into one of her mountainous breasts. Your small but effective claws jabbed into the supple blubber causing another hiss that shifted into a moo. The mooing became stronger as you shifted your grasp to the turgid nipple atop the mound, rolling the bud of flesh between your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you; you\u2019re getting so incredibly fat. Are you sure you don\u2019t have some pig in your family, maybe even some whale?\u201d Eve\u2019s blush deepened as she nodded again, repeating a game that the two of you had played many a time before in this situation. \u201cHmm\u2026I don\u2019t believe you, not completely. You do have to have a majority of cow blood though to have udders like these. There\u2019s just so much here.\u201d You continued as you dug your other hand her matching breast causing her to let out another low moo. \u201cMy mother was blessed in the bust department, and I ended up even better still, but they look downright tiny compared to these massive things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lifted her breasts before letting them fall with a slap atop her even larger stomach. The shock caused another wave of wiggling to travel around her myriad curves. You turned your attention to that temple of gluttony that dominated her form, grabbing double handfuls of the lowest and largest roll of fat. Deep beneath, you could feel the hardness of a huge amount of food packed within her stomach, but the thick layers of lard that you had packed onto her body meant that her belly remained soft looking no matter how much you fed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd as for <i>this</i>\u2026!\u201d you started sharply. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re getting so fat, you ate so much today, more than most people eat in a week. And you still won\u2019t more, don\u2019t you?\u201d Eve nodded again. \u201cYou want to feel your gut stretching around even more food?\u201d to which she responded with another forceful nod. The head bobbing was even more forceful when you asked \u201cYou want to push yourself till it feels like you might burst at any moment?\u201d The strongest confirmation yet came when you asked \u201cEven knowing that you\u2019re only going to get fatter and fatter?\u201d You grabbed the crop again and struck her stomach hard near the cavernous crater where her belly button should have been, before saying \u201cGood, because that is exactly what I want for you too and we\u2019re going to get started right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned on your heel \u2013 the leather corset creaking slightly around your busty frame \u2013 and marched to the winch on the wall. You turned it several clicks further, drawing up what little slack remained in the chain holding Eve\u2019s fleshy arms over her head and forcing her to nearly get on tip toes. She moaned slightly as her weight pulled on her joints, but as you expected of her, she didn\u2019t resist or speak. She instead stared at the mirrored wall in front of her, showing her every inch of her immense body. You instead turned your attention to the meal you were soon going to stuff your bovine pet with.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You typically wear a white sun dress with flowers in your hair, and a small loincloth underneath, something all Wood Elves wore as a reminder f their tribal heritage. Even though you're more than 100 years old, you're just a kid (you're barely more than 3 feet tall) since Elves age much slower than humans. You live with your loving Mother and Father in a tree house, and your village has been at peace with the neighboring Human Kingdom for centuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day you were playing out in the woods when you heard hundreds of footsteps echoing through the trees. You climbed a tree and gasped, seeing an army of human knights in the distance, marching toward you and the village! You had never seen war or knights before, but your instincts told you this was bad, very bad. Hurriedly, you rushed home to tell someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the first person you found was Maya Leater, a powerful Spellblade and Captain of the Village Defense Force.<br>\r\n\"Maya! Maya!\" You shouted.<br>\r\n\"Little Lydia, what's wrong?\" Maya said.<br>\r\n\"There... There are humans coming, ones wearing armor and... and carrying swords!\" You stammered.<br>\r\nA concerned look crossed Maya's face.<br>\r\n\"Lydia, go home to your parents. I'll gather the Defense Force and see what they want.\" Maya said.<br>\r\nYou ran back home as fast as your little legs could carry you. Your father was out, probably at work, but your mother was tidying up the house. She saw you looking scared and instantly bent down to give you a hug. Mom was a tall, <br>\r\n\"Lydia, what's wrong?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n\"There are men coming, scary ones with armor and swords.\" You said.<br>\r\nMom stroked your hair. She wanted to comfort you, but fear crossed her face as well.<br>\r\n\"I'll go find your father.\" Mom said.<br>\r\nShe took you inside the tree and took you down to the basement. Mom then handed you a small silver dagger.<br>\r\n\"This is a mythril dagger, Lydia. It's a special weapon that can cut through any armor. It's a weapon passed down from my Father, and his Mother, and her Mother too. Listen, if anyone tries to hurt you, I want you to give 'em a good stabbing, got it?\" Mom said.<br>\r\nYou were very scared now. You felt like you might cry.<br>\r\n\"Mom... please don't leave me alone.\" You whimpered.<br>\r\nMom gave you a small kiss.<br>\r\n\"Lydia, I'll only be gone for a few minutes. I need you to be strong right now, all right? You can do that for me? I know you're a strong girl\" Mom said.<br>\r\nYou nodded and took the mythril dagger in your hand.<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back, I promise.\" Mom said.<br>\r\nShe rushed upstairs and went to find your father.</span></div></div>",

Right?\" You told yourself, wishing, praying that everything would turn out fine and you would be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom quickly came back with your father. He was holding a sword now. You instantly ran to give him a hug.<br>\r\n\"Daddy! Daddy!\" You said.<br>\r\nYour father was a huntsman, so he was skilled with knives and bows. You felt safer just having him around.<br>\r\n\"Lydia! Hey!\" Your father said, smiling.<br>\r\n\"Daddy, what's going on? The humans... they're not here for war, right?\" You said, wide-eyed with fear.<br>\r\nYour father sighed.<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to sugar-coat it, Lydia, they might want to fight us. However, we're Elves. One of us is as skilled a fighter as ten of them! Even if they are here to fight, we have the Defense Force to protect us!\" Daddy said.<br>\r\nHis words sounded enthusiastic, but somehow he lacked conviction in his voice. He knew you could all be in great danger. You wanted to believe him, though. You wanted to think you were in no danger at all, that tomorrow everything would be back to normal and you'd be back to playing in the forest like nothing had ever happened.<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do?\" Your mother asked, placing a hand on Daddy's shoulder.<br>\r\n\"We wait. The Defense Force should be meeting up with the Humans soon, they might find out if they're peaceful or not.\" Daddy said.<br>\r\nThe three of you sat down together. Long minutes passed, which soon became hours. The tension was almost unbearable for all three of you. Your father kept looking up the stairs at the doorway, and back at the passage to the back door. Your mother nervously twitched. You fiddled with your hair, trying to distract yourself from the fear that was slowly overtaking your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a knock at the door. You nearly jumped out of your seat. Daddy grabbed a sword and answered. It was Maya Leater. Her arm was bloodied and her clothes were ripped.<br>\r\n\"Evacuate! We're being invaded! Get out while you can!\" Maya said.<br>\r\nShe rushed away to another house to go warn more people.<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Your father cursed.<br>\r\nYou didn't hear him curse very often, so you knew this was real trouble. He ran back to you and your mother.<br>\r\n\"Come on, out through the passage. We have to go. Now!\" Your father said.<br>\r\nMom took your hand and led you through the underground tunnel out the back door, with Daddy close behind. You exited behind the tree house and rushed into the woods.<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n\"Fort Elfhame. It should be a couple hours of running north. We need to get moving.\" Daddy said.<br>\r\nJust then, you heard a whirring sound from behind you. You father screamed in pain and collapsed.<br>\r\n\"Aiee!\" Your mother screamed, kneeling to his side.<br>\r\n\"Daddy!\" You shouted.<br>\r\nYour father had a crossbow bolt lodged in his ankle. He couldn't stand anymore. Your mother was weeping now. Slowly, a small squad of knights approached from behind, one of them carrying a large crossbow and the others with swords and war hammers.<br>\r\n\"Well, well. Trying to get tricky and escape us, are we?\" One of them said.<br>\r\nYour mother grabbed your father's sword.<br>\r\n\"Stay back! I mean it!\" Your mother said, trying to sound tough.<br>\r\nShe was trembling, though. It was obvious she was ready to crack. The knights laughed at her.<br>\r\nI'd bet you don't even know how to use that thing!\" One of them jeered.<br>\r\nHe swung his war hammer and bashed your mother in her ribs. She screamed, dropped the sword, and fell down.<br>\r\n\"Lydia... Run!\" Your father said.<br>\r\nYou went to dash away, but one of the knights grabbed you by the end of your sun dress. He pulled you close and clutched you in his arms. You took out the mythril dagger your mother had given you, but the knight casually knocked it out of your hand. it lay useless on the ground, having failed to protect you in the slightest.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're a little cutie! I'd bet you'd be worth a pretty penny at the slave market.\" He said.<br>\r\nAnother pair of knights restrained your mother.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the Mom would be great too. Nice big tits on this one, eh?\" Another knight laughed.<br>\r\nThey took a knife and sliced open your mother's blouse, exposing her large breasts to the world. Your mother squirmed, and a knight punched her in the stomach.<br>\r\n\"Quit moving around, bitch!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n\"How about the kid? Let's see what she's like.\" Another knight said.<br>\r\nYour father groaned.<br>\r\n\"Don't... don't you dare touch my daughter!\" He said.<br>\r\nOne of the knights laughed at him.<br>\r\n\"Can it, elven scum!\" He shouted.<br>\r\nHe took his war hammer and smashed your father's hand. You father screamed out and his hand was smashed into a bloody, useless mess. You began crying.<br>\r\n\"Aw, the kid's starting to cry! that's so cute.\" Another knight said.<br>\r\nHe took a knife and sliced off your sun dress, leaving you standing in nothing but your traditional loincloth. Your flat, undeveloped chest was fully visible now.<br>\r\n\"Aw, too small to have tits! What a bummer!\" The knight said.<br>\r\nAnother knight pushed him aside and took a look. He caressed your nipple. You let out a fearful moan.<br>\r\n\"I think she's pretty cute. Come on, let's get these two back to the slave market. I wanna make some money!\" He said.<br>\r\n\"What about the man?\" Another knight asked.<br>\r\n\"He's broken. We don't need him. nobody wants to buy a crippled slave. you know what to do with him.\" The first knight said.<br>\r\nOne of the knights approached your wounded father. With a single slice of the sword, they cut of his head, right in front of you.<br>\r\n\"Daddy!\" You screamed out.<br>\r\nYour mother said nothing. She only cried. You were weeping too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knights tied you and your mother's hands together and drove you forward, out of the woods into the Human Kingdom. in the distance, you saw dozens of other squads of knights just like the one that captured you. All of them had captives, and all of them were from your village. You could see your people in binds and shackles, most of them with their clothing ripped and shredded, sometimes with battle wounds too. In a single, horrible day, your entire village was taken captive and enslaved.</span></div></div>",

The humans all laughed at you and threw garbage at you, even the children. You narrowly avoided getting hit in the head with a tin can and your mother was hit on her butt with an old potato. You shamefully looked at the ground as they took you to the auctioning block, unable to look your tormentors in the face. When you were almost there, am an jumped out from the crowd and tried to fondle your mother's bare breasts. She jumped back and one of the knights that captured you pushed him away.<br>\r\n\"Easy on the merchandise! You wanna fuck her, you'll have to buy her!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your mother were shackled together and put in a cage, where you would wait until your auction started. You buried your head in your mother's arms and cried. she cried as well.<br>\r\n\"Lydia... Lydia... We're going to make it through this, all right?\" Mom said.<br>\r\nYou couldn't speak. Only despaired moans escaped your lips. She held you tight, not wanting to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, it was time. A couple of goons pulled you and Mom out of the cage and walked you to the auctioning block. Your shackled clinked as you walked, and they felt so heavy. You were put on stage in front of a massive crowd of humans. The barker introduced you.<br>\r\n\"Next up, we have a special treat! This is a young elf girl and her gorgeous mother!\" He said.<br>\r\nThe barker approached your mother and put his hands on her bare breasts. Mom closed her eyes and cringed.<br>\r\n\"And what a mother she is! Just look at the tits she's got! What a catch! And check out her ass!\" The barker said.<br>\r\nHe turned Mom around and grabbed her loincloth. He lifted the back and gave the audience a view of her butt.<br>\r\n\"Whew! If little girly over here grows up to be half as hot as her mother... but that would take many years... Whatever! Mommy's a hot one, no doubt about it!\" The barker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barker turned his attention to you. You felt so vulnerable being up like this, nearly naked with only your small loincloth to cover you, and with your hands and feet in shackles. The barker grabbed you by the hair and pulled your head up to face the crowd. You yelped, and Mom gasped.<br>\r\n\"Please... don't hurt my daughter...\" Mom quietly begged.<br>\r\nThe barker ignored her plea. You hair was still being pulled and it hurt.<br>\r\n\"Little girly over here's a real cutie! The short blonde hair, those cute little legs... Don't you just want to break her?!?\" The barker laughed.<br>\r\nThe crowd laughed too. The barker's hands moved lower, down to your loincloth. You started crying. You didn't like where this was going. The barker lifted it and showed everyone your... private area. You blushed and cried both at once, utterly humiliated beyond anything you had felt before.<br>\r\n\"Look at this virgin pussy! She's not grown yet, but when she's there you're going to have a good fuck, if you're into elves, I guess.\" The barker said.<br>\r\nHe turned you around and showed everyone your butt.<br>\r\n\"And this lovely little butt! Perfect for spanking when you're in a cruddy mood and want to hit someone! The possibilities with this little girly are endless! So, how about we start the sale? Bidding starts at 5 pieces of gold, 4 for the mother and 1 for the child!\" The barker said. He gave your <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flurry of bids came about. People really wanted to buy your mother; she was one of the hot items today. You never really thought of her as being particularly beautiful, since Elves thought a slender body and smaller chest were attractive, so it shocked you how much she was going for. In the end, You were sold for 3 gold and 2 silver, while your mother went for a whopping11 gold and 9 silver. You wept the whole time as your mother occasionally helped wipe your tears. This was truly the worst day of your life.</span></div></div>",

Your Majesty.\" Ashlyn said, nearly forgetting Misty's title again.<br>\r\nMisty went and examined the chair. Ashlyn kneeled, her head only reaching Misty's waist. Even as an adult Fae elf, she was slightly smaller than a human child.<br>\r\n\"Well, I think Daddy should take over this project, he'd do a much better job that <i>you</i>, Elfy.\" Misty said.<br>\r\nAshlyn bowed her head and closed her eyes. Misty punctuated her disapproval by giving Ashlyn a slap across her face. This sort of shame was normal for her. She often felt she couldn't do anything right.<br>\r\nMisty then skipped off toward the furnace. Ashlyn began to put away her tools. Soon, Misty returned, wearing her yellow magical heat-proof gloves, holding a red-hot coal in her hands. She had a sadistic smile on her face and gazed at Ashlyn. The elf girl's eyes went wide with horror. It wasn't unusual to be tormented by the kids. Misty especially, was a tyrannical little bully.<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna get ya, elfy!\" Misty said, running at Ashlyn, hot coal in hand.<br>\r\n\"Eek!\" The slave girl shrieked.<br>\r\nShe tried to run, but Misty was too fast. Ashlyn was tackled to the ground with ease, seeing as how she was a weak little elf and Misty was a strong little girl.<br>\r\n\"Burn, elfy burn!\" Misty laughed.<br>\r\nAshlyn struggled and screamed but it was no use. Misty rubbed the burning coal all over the elf girl's thighs, leaving dark burns all over. Misty was having the time of her life, and smiled the entire time, each of Ashlyn's screams a new reason to laugh. Then, she moved the coal higher, approaching Ashlyn's butt.<br>\r\n\"P... Please, Your Majesty! Not there!\" Ashlyn cried, her eyes welling up with tears.<br>\r\nShe'd been scorched before, and Master Arthur always healed her wounds, but she hated when she was burnt around her butt and her genitals, which the kids were unfortunately quite good at harming.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're gonna get it, you stupid elfy slave!\" Misty laughed.<br>\r\nThat kid was seriously fucked up in the head.</span></div></div>",

If was a hot, unpleasant, and dirty job, the dirtiest there ever was. Ashlyn bravely faced the challenge. She got her cleaning supplies together and approached the filthy fireplace. Not wanting to ruin her dress (it was raggedy and ugly, but it was one of the few articles of clothing she owned, so se didn't want it ruined) Ashlyn removed it from her body, leaving herself totally naked (most of the slaves didn't get to wear underwear)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlyn took to scrubbing the stone fireplace and soon began coughing. Her little lungs filled with soot from simply from entering the fireplace. Fearlessly, she scrubbed and coughed through the grime until the bottom part was sparkling clean. Ashlyn smiled at seeing how well she did, but then she felt something light falling on her head, like snowflakes.<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" The Elf girl said.<br>\r\nShe looked up and saw thick crusts of burnt residue built up in the chimney.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I thought I was so close...\" Ashlyn said, hanging her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she had to clean that chimney as best she could. Ashlyn took her scraper and sponge and wedged herself into the chimney. Carefully, the naked little elf girl pushed herself up, balancing only by the force of her legs pushing against the walls. Ashlyn scraped and wiped at the burnt residue, but she was beginning to grow weak and tired already. A nervous sweat formed on her forehead. She was nearly done with the top of one of the walls, but she knew she couldn't hold on much longer. She glanced down at the stone fireplace below and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlyn lost her footing and fell to the ground. Large amounts of burnt cinders fell with her getting in her hair, in her eyes, all over her back. Her whole body hurt after falling like that. Ashlyn let out a low, pained moan. Quickly, Master Arthur came in to see what happened.<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness! Ashlyn, are you okay? What happened?\" Master Arthur said.<br>\r\nLucky for Ashyln, he was probably the nicest and most caring of her owners. The elf girl tried to get up, but she was hurt pretty bad. Master Arthur took her hand and helped her to her feet.<br>\r\n\"I... I was cleaning the fireplace and... I went to go clean the chimney a little bit too... and then I fell.\" Ashlyn said, out of breath.<br>\r\n\"Wow, well that explains how you got so filthy.\" Master Arthur said.<br>\r\nHe looked around his slave girls body, and seeing that she didn't seem to have any broken bones and wasn't bleeding, decided she was all right.<br>\r\n\"Well, you seem fine, just shook up and dirty.\" Master Arthur said.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir! Just a bit shook up, that's all!\" Ashlyn said.<br>\r\nShe didn't want to seem useless or broken.

Then, He handed Ashlyn her loincloth. It consisted of a white belt-like piece of cloth that tied around her waist and two small white squares that hung over her crotch and butt. It did almost nothing to cover her, and her small breasts were fully exposed. Ashlyn felt like she was being stared at, and a little bit cold.<br>\r\n\"Comfortable?\" Master Arthur asked, pressing his hand onto the soft material of the loincloth against Ashyln's butt.<br>\r\n\"I...

She figured good slave whores were safe and bad slave whore would probably get whipped or beaten.

Nindy is owned by a wealthy teenage Human Princess named Princess Sally, although to Nindy she is often referred to simply as \"Your Majesty\". Princess Sally has long black hair and typically wears a pink dress and a tiara. She keeps him as her personal plaything and delights in tormenting and humiliating the poor little elf boy. She owns other Fae Elf slaves, both boys and girls, which she also enjoys tormenting and humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___________________________________________________<br>\r\nNindir was in the hallway cleaning some dust with a damp rag. He was wearing a raggedy blue tunic a bit too large for him and a white loincloth underneath. He was just outside Princess Sally's room and could hear the young princess inside with a female Elf Slave.<br>\r\n\"Mitz, you idiot! How many times have I told you not to leave your cleaning supplies in my room?!?\" Princess Sally raged.<br>\r\nNindir peeked inside and saw Sally screaming at Mitz, one of the cuter elf girls in Sally's Castle. Mitz was short, even for a Fae Elf, and very delicate and slender, with pretty orange hair. Mitz reminded Nindir of a Tulip in Elf form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Sally angrily threw a cleaning sponge at Mitz's face as the little elf girl cowered in fear.<br>\r\n\"I... I apologize, Your Majesty! I just left it there for a moment while I went to go get more soap to clean your floors, honest!\" Mitz fearfully said.<br>\r\nNindir felt sorry for the little Mitz. He knew Princess Sally wouldn't go easy on her. He continued cleaning the walls and listened intently.<br>\r\n\"Your apologies mean nothing, you little worm! Come here!\" Princess Sally said, with an evil smile on her face.<br>\r\nShe grabbed Mitz and pulled off the Elf Girl's dress, leaving her naked since she didn't have any underwear on. The Princess then bent Mitz over her knees and took out a little paddle.<br>\r\n\"Please, Princess, I'm sorry! It'll never happen again!\" Mitz cried.<br>\r\nNindir had to keep from laughing. Even though Mitz was a real cutie and he liked her it was fun to see someone else getting spanked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Sally began rapidly smacking Mitz's bare bottom, over and over again. Mitz screamed and cried like a child as Princess Sally laughed sadistically... and Nindir felt a funny sensation in his loins, seeing Mitz beaten like this. He was deeply ashamed of it but it felt so good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Sally soon finished spanking little Mitz and tossed the Elf girl to the ground.<br>\r\n\"You screw up again today and you get The Whip, understand?\" Princess Sally said, threateningly.<br>\r\nThe sadistic princess smiled an evil smile. She actually hoped Mitz would screw up as she loved to use The Whip on her slaves. The blood-curdling crack, their scream of pain, their blood, their fear, their humiliation, it made her wet in the panties just thinking about it.<br>\r\n\"Ye... Yes ,Your Highness! Understood, your Highness!\" Mitz said, fearfully.<br>\r\nShe ran out into the hallway where Nindir was waiting, still nude and carrying her dress in her arms. Princess Sally slammed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Nindir do?</span></div></div>",

Even fully engorged, Nindir's cock was embarrassingly small by human standards, as all Elf cocks were, although compared to other elves he was average. He squeezed himself and moved his hands, harder and faster, harder and faster. Involuntarily, he panted and softly grunted, jerking off in the small dark broom closet like some kind of horny teenager, it felt so wrong but felt so good.. Just as he was about to climax, he heard a voice outside.<br>\r\n\"What's all this grunting in the broom closet? Who's voice...

Your majesty, I was...\" Nindir stammered.<br>\r\n\"You were masturbating in my broom closet, weren't you? You filthy, filthy, little Elf! Ha ha, you're getting a special punishment for this!\" Princess Sally said.<br>\r\nShe grabbed Nindir by the arm and dragged him down to her dungeon in the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dungeon was a dark and scary place. Elves who misbehaved, and some who hadn't done anything wrong at all, were taken here to be punished by their tyrannical princess. It was guarded by a pair of magical Golems, creatures of clay and stone that protected key parts of Princess Sally's Castle. Though silent, their faces suggested they were just as cruel and sadistic as their master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Sally took a pair of scissors and cut Nindir's tunic and loincloth from his body, leaving the elf boy nude. She often loved taking away her slaves' clothing for extra laughs. Nindir only quivered, glad she was taking the scissors to his clothing and not his balls.<br>\r\n\"Nindy, we can't have you going around jerking off in my castle. You're too horny for your own good, you little pervert! And what if you lost control and impregnated one of the elf girls, hm?\" Princess Sally said, resting her arms on Nindir's shoulders. The elf boy was in a cold, fearful sweat now.<br>\r\n\"I think we need to put you in a chastity cage, just to be safe.\" Princess Sally said.<br>\r\nShe got out a small metal cage designed to go around male elf genitals. Not only did it prevent anyone from really touching his cock, it also had a magical aura around it that prevented him from ever reaching orgasm,  but did not prevent the ability to become aroused. Princess Sally locked Nindir's cock up and slipped the key in a small pocket in her purse. She giggled and tapped her fingers on the small cage.<br>\r\n\"Looks like you won't be using that for a while, huh, Nindy?\" She said.<br>\r\nNindir only shamefully stood there, silent as could be, his face looking downwards at the floor.<br>\r\n\"Now go on, go clean your icky little elf sperm out before it stains. Now!\" Princess Sally commanded.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Your Majesty!\" Nindir said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Nindir rushed to the closet to clean up his mess, even though most of it was on his loincloth which was in the trash now. Wearing only the chastity cage, he got back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to him next?</span></div></div>",

Mitz stood with her mouth hanging wide, hardly able to believe what she was seeing.<br>\r\n\"Ew...\" She gasped.<br>\r\n\"P... Please, Mitz, you weren't meant to see this!
