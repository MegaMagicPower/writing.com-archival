Outside was the sound of birds chirping and Yoshis playing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the small wooden hut nestled in the woods, with the large \"Mario\" sign hanging over the door, it's two occupants were slowly waking. Mario, the short Italian plumber with blue eyes and chocolate colored hair, and Peach, the lovely princess of the Mushroom Kingdom. They were sharing a bed, cuddled up to each other nice and close, dressed in only their underwear. Luigi had traveled to Sarasaland to visit Daisy, so they had the whole place to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...heh - <b>hahahahah</b>, s-stop tickling me princess!\" Mario suddenly protested, the calm ambiance broken by a sudden giggle fit. Peach smiled mischievously, under the covers her delicate hands carefully played with and prodded Mario's most sensitive areas, namely his cute tum. With both hands she explored Mario's body, pinching at his small love handles and rubbing at his chest and soft belly with her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see someone's woken up in a good mood today, eh?\" Mario pointed out, a slight smugness creeping into his voice. Mario was always happy to be the center of attention, especially if it was from beautiful ladies. \"Mmmm, Mario I'm in a great mood. Just you and me, no Toads, no Bowser, no responsibility... and after <i>last night</i>... how could anybody wake up in a bad mood.\" Peach responded, and Mario let out a chuckle, which turned into a gasp as the princess' fingers got a little more frisky and her pinky finger hooked into his red underwear, giving it a snap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach leaned in, giving Mario a tender kiss on the cheek, then collapsing on top of him and pushing Mario back into the mattress. \"A-ah, Princess? Didn't we have other plans this morning? Mama Mia!\" Mario hesitantly reminded his lover, though he made no move to escape her embrace. The lucky man was a good deal shorter than the Princess, so presently with her on top of him like this he had his large nose wedged betwixt her amble bosom. Peach paid no heed to Mario's words and went back to caressing his pudgy frame, tracing a finger up his treasure trail and into his belly button, giving it a curious poke to see how deep her finger would go. Her other hand grabbed a handful of Mario's soft little tush, afterwards giving it a satisfying slap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario blushed, always slightly embarrassed about being teased over his weight. It didn't help that he was almost sure he was a bit more paunchy than usual, the lull in kidnapping activity meant he'd gotten less exercise lately. Plus, being around Peach so often was taking a toll on his figure, it seemed like she always had a fresh baked cake or pie ready for him to consume. She'd invite him over for massive dinners at the castle and make him take home far too much leftovers. She was practically always fostering food onto him, and Mario couldn't understand why she didn't realize it was making her squeeze... more squishy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't even stop in bed, lately Peach had developed a nasty habit of bringing food into their love making. It was rather awkward the first time she had him cuffed to the bed posts and suddenly produced a large cake from seemingly thin air. But there was no arguing with her in bed, she was incredibly dominant, so he ate every slice that the princess hand fed him. She said it was food-play, to spice up their love life, and granted it made for some of the most amazing sex the couple had ever had, but it was still weird to feel bloated after lovemaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least whenever Mario worried to himself about his weight, he knew he could easily work off these excess pounds the next time he went on an adventure. And at least Peach still seemed attracted to his body, in fact it almost seemed like she was more amorous than usual, what a weird coincidence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Peach had discarded her frilly brassiere and was gently fondling herself, if Peach had gained any weight over the last few months it had gone straight to her breasts which were large and curvacious and bounced slightly anytime she did something active. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario groaned, feeling his member stir in his now too tight briefs. For a short guy Mario was packing, like <b>really</b> packing. His over-sized salami and meatballs looked practically out of place on his tubby body, not that Peach was complaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little difficulty he shimmied out of his underwear and grabbed a-hold of the princess' hips, his turgid member springing up skyward, the smell of arousal was in the air as the two drank each other in with their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Peach reached over to the dresser-draws beside the bed. Mario was confused for a moment, until he saw what she was retrieving, a box of donuts. Had she hidden them there the entire time? Was this her plan all along?! Mario had no time to think it over because already Peach was pulling out a large pastry with pink frosting and sprinkles, waving it enticingly at the plumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario loved food, but sweet stuff wasn't exactly his favorite food group, he liked savory, meaty, salty and fatty things most. It looked like there was at least a dozen full sized donuts in the container, one of every flavor. The prospect of eating all that before breakfast wasn't very enticing, but from past experience he knew by the end of this he'd have finished the whole box. The princess would reward him for every bit he consumed, so without complaint he opened his mouth for her to put it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, good boy, my little hero is learning.\" Peach complimented, and without hesitation shoved the sugar laden treat into Mario's maw, a bit too forceful for Mario's liking as he struggled to swallow it down, getting icing on his cheeks and a few sprinkles in his carefully maintained mustache. But before he could complain Peach was already reaching for another, chocolate this time, and Mario just had time to catch his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for a while, mixed in-between with heated moments of hip grinding, neck kissing, belly rubbing and lip licking. The room was hot and muggy by the time the ordeal was over, the two laying next to each other both thoroughly spent. They were both red faced and breathing heavily, though Mario was a bit worse for wear, having to also contend with his distended stuffed stomach, which rose like a small taut dome over his midsection. He had to have consumed enough calories in that session to add a few more pounds to his already overweight gut, but thoughts like that were the furthest thing from his mind as he just laid right there with his partner, fully contented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stayed there for about half an hour until Peach suddenly sat up in bed, something on her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mario looked her directly in the face and noticed that her eyes seemed to reflect that laugh back at him. It hit Mario what it was about. She was going to bring back even more food. Mario did like the electric feeling that the food brought to their sex, but for him enough was enough. He just couldn't handle it anymore. <br>\r\n\"No.\" Mario said firmly, but almost regretted it afterwards when he saw the look of hurt on Peach's face. However, he was committed at this point and he couldn't stop now. \"Peach,\" Mario began somewhat timidly, voice wobbling sightly, but gaining strength as he began to speak more. \"It needs to stop. I know that you know what I'm talking about, and I'm just going to day that I'm tired of it. This is starting to get unhealthy and we need to stop.\" Mario finished speaking and saw the hurt in her eyes, but knew he had done the right thing. Little did Mario notice, was the burning fire of revenge behind Peach's eyes. She was going to get her tubby plumber one way or another. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Mario,\" her ice blue eyes softening \"I shouldn't of acted this way towards you. I think maybe it would be best if we took a short break from each other. Not breaking up, but a short time to ourselves.\" Peach then got out of the bed and started dressing again, her beautiful pink dress sparking in the early morning sun that shone brightly through a small chink in the window blinds. <br>\r\nMario salivated slightly at his girl friend's form, but he knew that the break was for the best. Mario got dressed too, his now even more round belly protruding far enough to where he couldn't button his overalls. Mario didn't care and gently showed Peach to the door and said a polite goodbye. As Peach left, she couldn't help but let out a small smirk at her plans for Mario. She was going to get her rotund boyfriend that she wanted.<br>\r\nXxX<br>\r\nAbout a half a month had passed since the start of the break and Mario wasted no time getting his body back to its previous state and replaced his boxers with elastic ones, so to measure his progress in a way. It wasn't long before he had achieved getting his body back and he rejoiced. Luigi was still gone with Daisy and the stay was prolonged due to a ghost incident that it only took one man to handle (but that's a story for another time).<br>\r\nMario woke up to the doorbell. Something told him it was Peach, and his suspicions were confirmed when he opened the front door to her standing there, holding what seemed like a small Tupperware container filled with a mysterious green substance. \"Hey, I'd like you to know again that I'm sorry, so here is some salad to help you with the weight loss. Peach almost shoved the container into Mario's hands and left hastily with a \"I need to take care of something!\" shouted over her shoulder. Mario stared at the container in his hands and opened it up and examined it. It was indeed salad without a trace of sweets in sight. Mario looked up, happy, and marched into the kitchen and brought out a fork and started to eat. It was delicious! Mario continued to eat the salad, not noticing Peach peering into the window undetected, excited to see the fruits of her labour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach had done it! She created the perfect trap for Mario by combing her cooking and science knowledge. Sure it took longer than she wanted to in order to create it, but she felt satisfied. She had created the perfect salad; her kind of salad! After fusing a p-balloon and super mushroom together, she created a salad that would cause massive weight gain in the person who eats it. Peach couldn't wait to see what happens when Mario eats it and couldn't restrain herself from peaking in on her boyfriend finishing the salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario finished what he had considered the best salad he had ever tasted. If this was Peach's new trend of bringing health food that tasted good into bed, he could get behind that. Mario looked down at his now flatter stomach, patting it and happy that Peach was respecting his wishes. Mario continued sitting on the stool in his kitchen, savoring the nice after taste of the salad, when Mario got a weird feeling in his gut. It felt as if he was slowly getting fuller, even though he had already finished the salad. Mario looked down at his gut, finding it looking normal to his relief, and he got up, just as a tingling sensation began in his stomach. Mario's hand was still on his belly when he felt the most curious sensation as if his gut was getting bigger. Mario shrugged this off and walked off to the TV to see what was on. The tingling sensation suddenly got stronger, making Mario stop in his tracks and looked down. To his horror he noticed his gut was in fact larger! Mario stared at this new growth and noticed it was still growing. Mario stared at his now swelling belly, at a loss of what to do, unsure of if it was even real. A sudden pop inside Mario's body shifted him back into reality. He had spaced long enough to give his gut time to grow even larger, to where it popped out a good one solid foot in front of him, setting off his balance somewhat, while his gut continued to grow larger. Mario gave his belly a tentative poke, finding the growth soft and squishy like fat. Mario had to do something fast and he started walking, his swelling belly making it hard to move as it got even bigger. Two loud pings interrupted Mario's walk as he found his belly had gotten so big that his overalls couldn't take the pressure. Mario slowly made his way to his room, his gut now drooping over his upper legs and hanging out of his red shirt. Mario quickly sat on his bed, not sure what good that would do, and looked at his ever expanding tummy. He was scared and unsure why this was happening to him. The tingling feeling got stronger once more and his belly growth got faster, Mario feeling fuller and fuller as his gut continued to bloat up like a balloon. A ripping noise rang out through the tiny house as Mario's shirt hit it's capacity limit and started to rip as his belly pushed it out further. His gut protruded a good 5 feet in front of him, touching the floor and hiding his legs effectively from view, when all of a sudden, the tingling stopped and his gut seemed to have stop swelling. Mario stared down at his mysterious massive belly in terror, unsure of what to do, when suddenly the tingling feeling began in his upper torso and arms. Mario watched on in horror as his chest started to puff up with fat to try and aspire to be like his ridiculously large belly. Mario tried to feel the chest area when he noticed that he could barely move his arms at all. Mario looked to his sides and saw his arms slowly inflating from the fat to where they were stuck sticking out to the sides. Upon closer inspection, Mario realized that his arms were being absorbed into his now bloated and almost spherical body. The tingling feeling then began on Mario's face and he saw his cheeks puff out and felt it harder to move his head. Then the tingling feeling began in Mario's legs as they started to slowly puff up. It wasn't long before a loud rip was heard and what remained of his overalls fell off. Mario tried to get up so he could find a mirror, but as he plopped down to the floor, his legs never touched the ground. His legs had been absorbed too! Mario's nether regions had inflated enough to where only they touched the floor, leaving Mario to awkwardly crotch waddle over to the nearby full body mirror to look at himself, fat jiggling profusely as he went. Mario was almost completely spherical and his elastic underwear and shoes and socks and gloves being all that covered him. Suddenly his entire body tingled more and underwent one final growth. Mario watched as his viewpoint got slightly higher due to his nether regions expanding more. Mario watched on in a strange fascination as his body first absorbed his feet, popping his shoes and socks off and tiny little stubs of toes sticking out of his spherical body, being the only thing that remained of his feet. Next went his hands, slipping off his gloves as his hands and palms were absorbed, leaving only nubs sticking out as fingers, much like his toes. Mario expanded slightly more, his fingers toes and head making indents in his body as they refused to be completely absorbed. All at once, the tingling stopped, leaving the now impossibly fat Mario, sitting there (as if that's the proper expression), unsure of what to do with all that just happened to him. All of a sudden, Peach came in, clearly impressed and happy with how Mario looked and she was carrying......</span></div></div>",

Really, all he wanted to do was find a guest room and get some sleep. His brother had been making so much noise with the Princess in the next room, he was forced to find a quieter corner of the castle. What were they doing in there that was so loud? Mario had mentioned something about cake before blushing as brightly as the cap on his head. He decided he didn't really want to know anyway if Mario was so embarrassed about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A faint ethereal cry froze Luigi mid-step. Something was hiding around the corner. Or maybe it was nothing. He listened closely, steadying his quickening breaths. No, the sound seemed less like a cackle and more like a sob. Straining his neck, he tiptoed nearly to the corner and just barely caught sight of a small, trembling boo. He broke out in a cold sweat. Nope, he wash not dealing with any boos tonight!

Smokey tears trickled down its face, dissipating before they reached the ground, and its tiny arms covered its black eyes.

Frozen in terror, unable to anything but to return its gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are you my mom?\" It asked in a girl's voice. Luigi slowly shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" She looked down, on the verge of tears. \" It's just... I've been searching for my mom for as long as I can remember.\" Ghostly tears began to leak out of her eyes once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I-Its-a okay.\" He couldn't stand to see the poor thing cry. \"Maybe I can help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where I am!

Now Bowser was trying to think of a way to get revenge on Mario and his friends but how would he do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curse that Princess Peach!

The channel that Bowser turned to was the sumo wrestling channel. Little did his minions know is that he secretly liked the sport despite insisting that he wants to lose weight. Yet most of Bowser's minions knew when it came to weight loss that Bowser was a complete hypocrite. Bowser liked the fact that People larger than himself get paid for eating all they want and that they were strong too. Then an idea formed in Bowser's head. Why not become a sumo wrestler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser pondered the idea and thought it was good. It also made sense since he needed to pay for repairs and pay his overdue child support that he owes his ex. Yet shouldn't she be paying him for Jr. It didn't matter for Bowser was determined to defeat the Mario Bros. and friends and sue his ex-wife for his children back, except Jr. Unbeknownst to Bowser his ex was making plans to force him into another marriage. But to do that she needed the right bait and what better bait than the Mario Bros. The Koopa Queen then smirks evilly as she watches Bowser through her crystal ball. Later...</span></div></div>",

Yoshi\u2019s main plan was to get mainly apples or berries he found in the forest, he had a knack for telling how fresh or ripe any fruit he came across, like most Yoshis do. Yoshi made his way through his forest while humming a Happy Yoshi tune to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough unknown to him, in another part of the forest, Kamek was there with some Mushrooms, though not to use them, but to put a curse on them, as he became aware of Yoshi coming through the forest on occasion to get some more fruit to eat, both he and Bowser had hatched a plan together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs whenever they attacked the Mushroom Kingdom, Yoshi was the thorn in their side, as he\u2019s the one who helps Mario or Luigi the most to fight off any of Bowers Minions or help them get to Bowser, as well as the one who give the Bros any Power-ups they would require with some assistance with some toads as well for watching his back/keeping the power-ups safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their recent defeat, in which they nearly won but lost due to Yoshis quick thinking and getting the Life-up Mushroom to the bros when they were down and with help of a toad, giving them both the Invincibility star and super leaf while Yoshi dealt with the ground enemies then Kamek. After the battle was won, Mario and Luigi were both thanking Yoshi for giving it all and being of great help for them during the battle against Bowser, as Bowser, Kamek and any others retreated away back to Bowser\u2019s Castle, Kamek happened to hear that Yoshi would have considered using a Super Mushroom or even a Mega Mushroom to send them packing if he was too late to give them the items needed to restore their health and needed to retreat to the castle temperamentally, with both bros saying that maybe the next time or another time Bowser attempts to attack the kingdom or steal peach, he can use one if he desires, with Yoshi saying he would love to do anytime personally but rather do it if is a last resort but acknowledged the offer as hes been helpful a lot for the Mushroom Kingdom and how he is given a choice to have one when they got extras anytime or whenever he feels like it due to his extreme helpfulness in being there when Bowser attacks the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on that day, Kamek told Bowser about How Yoshi seems to have an interest in using the Power-up mushrooms the Mario Bros are known to use from time to time, Bowser responded questioning what that even means to them, with Kamek replying how he could put a curse on the mushrooms that could potentially make him evil and work for them instead of helping the Mario Bros. In which Bowser considered it to be a great idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamek as well as some of Bowser\u2019s minions spent the next few days looking for some Power-up Mushrooms around the Mushroom Kingdom without being caught to lower any suspicions on their plan or even cause any at all. Once they had a good amount of the mushrooms they picked for Yoshi to go for, they planned at night to plant them hidden in the forest in an area where Yoshi would travel during his walk for his fruit, with Kamek returning early in the morning to place the curse onto them once they have been placed ready for their plan. Once the Mushrooms were ready, Kamek then placed the curse onto the Mushrooms one at a time, eventually getting to the last one done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he finished the last one, Kamek snickered to himself, thinking their plan would be full proof and also put an end to the Mushroom Kingdom and have Bowser take over the Kingdom and eventually the world. It wasn\u2019t long until Kamek heard in the distance what sounded like Yoshi humming to himself, in which Kamek knew he had to get out of there before he showed up. Kamek jumped onto his broomstick and flew away back to Bowser\u2019s castle before Yoshi could reach the area he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshi continued on his way until he reached the area where Kamek was with the mushrooms, as Yoshi was looking around the area ready to take a short break from all the walking he has been doing, something caught his attention behind a bush. \u201cHmm..What that over there?\u201d, said Yoshi as he made his way to what he saw, when he got close enough he gasped at what he saw with his own eyes left in a big pile together a load off\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What Yoshi saw in front of him were Super Mushrooms, which surprised him since he never sees any at all whenever he goes through the forest. There were quite a lot of them in a pile, in which it took Yoshi by surprise, he was taken aback by the fact he found some just lying there in a forest, waiting for someone to get. All Yoshi knew was that the Power-up Mushrooms they have for whenever Bowser attacks the Kingdom are found outside the forest around the Mushroom kingdom or kept in a garden around the castle grounds. However despite this, Yoshi felt suspicious about this, something felt fishy about him finding Super Mushrooms in the forest, especially the area where he goes by for his fruit picking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething doesn\u2019t quite add up here\u201d Yoshi said, scratching the back of his head, \u201cHow come I never see these in the area at all despite all the time I come here for fruit collecting. This doesn\u2019t make any sense at all\u201d. Yoshi spent some time looking at the pile of the Mushrooms still pondering how he never saw them or even anyone else who would go for a walk in the forest from time to time. Yoshi grabbed one and looked at it thoroughly, Yoshi then sniffed the mushroom to see if there\u2019s anything off about them, in which there wasn\u2019t, afterwards he squeezed it to see if he could see if sense what kind of energy it gave off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon giving it a squeeze, he felt the exact kind of energy coming from the mushroom that would of a normal super mushroom. He knew this as there were a few times he needed to carry two of them to the Mario Bros he gripped them tight and felt the power of them on him, however they didn\u2019t affect him in anyway but the feeling from it did make him like it, in which has made him willing to want to have one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems these are the real deal\u201d Yoshi said as he placed the Super Mushroom down, \u201cBut there\u2019s still something that doesn\u2019t seem right about these being here\u201d Yoshi said, still pondering on whether he should eat one still. He had to think it over if he should risk it and eat one to see if they were Super Mushrooms or not. He Looked at the pile again and saw that there a lot, he considered if he should take them all so in the event Bowser found them he would take them or even use them, which he or even his friends didn\u2019t even want to happen at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshi decided to take them all, though it would take more than one trip as his sack wouldn\u2019t be able to carry them all, he did have some extra ones back at his home. He grabbed a few, doing his checks like he did for the first one and stuffed them in his sack; he made a mental note on how many were left. Afterwards he clutched the end of the sack tight as he could and bolted back home with them, despite his physique, Yoshi was one fast runner so he could get home &amp; back quickly. As Yoshi returned back to his home, he opened up his storage and placed the Mushrooms inside there, as well as the fruits he had collected before hand, thankfully he had enough fruit for a few days, in which he assumes Bowser won\u2019t attack for a while after his last attack. Yoshi grabbed another sack with him and made his way back to where they were. He hurried back to where they were to see if they were still there, in which to his luck, they were there still, all intact and didn\u2019t look any different when he looked at them. He once again checked them again one by one and placed them into the sacks. He continued with this until he had collected them all, it took him a little over three hours to do this, even with any short breaks to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Yoshi returned home, he placed the last set of mushrooms into storage with some of them outside, in the event he decides to eat one or a few. Yoshi sat down on the ground looking at the mushrooms that he left out, pondering if he should eat them or not, on one hand, if they were super mushrooms, that would be good and he had an easy supply of them for whenever he wants, but on the other hand if they were tainted or anything bad, it would be horrible for him, even if he did quickly regurgitate it out of his body. If it did end up being that, he knew that if it did end up being something Bowser or even Kamek did, they would pay hard, he would make them wish they never considered doing it, even he did have his limits for when Bowser and co attacked them or even harmed any fellow Yoshi for no reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much thinking, Yoshi decided to risk it and eat one, he noticed there were super mushrooms nearby his house so if it did end up being a poison mushroom, he could spit it out instantly and eat the super mushroom to counteract it. Yoshi walked towards one of the mushrooms, he picked one up and looked at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshi took a deep breath and kept reinsuring himself that nothing bad would happen, he moved it towards his mouth and had his tongue go around the mushroom and pull it into his mouth. The first test went well, it didn\u2019t make him sick, all he knew about poison mushrooms from what he has been told is that they tasted disgusting and were pretty bad for a Yoshi especially. \u201cEverything go alright so far\u201d Yoshi thought to himself as he swallowed the mushroom whole. Yoshi didn\u2019t feel anything happen to him, but did make his way towards the super mushroom that was located near his house, but then it happened\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshi started growing in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshi was stunned at what is happening to him as he felt his whole body start to slowly increase in size slowly feeling such thrill as he grew bigger. In a short time he grew by 3ft in size, with more in size to grow from it. As Yoshi continued to grow in size he looked at the other mushrooms he left out and was thinking what would happen if he had another one right now or soon. Yoshi\u2019s growth continued at a slow pace as it slowly came to a stop at a size of around 20ft tall. He felt that the Mushroom must have a stronger effect on him or even other Yoshi\u2019s as opposed to the Mario Bros., but it didn\u2019t matter, Yoshi found a stash of Mushrooms and has them for himself. Yoshi sat down and looked around the area of his house, admiring his new size, he believes he could get use to this; he actually liked the idea of being large, only downside being he would need to eat more. Yoshi pondered to himself if he should eat another mushroom, would it stack on top of his size as of now, or nothing at all, given that the later happens with the Mario Bros, he wondered this since the mushroom seemed to have a stronger effect on him, if it did stack, his main priority would be make sure he gets somewhere safe and doesn\u2019t destroy anything during his growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshi got up and grabbed another mushroom from the pile and then crammed it into his mouth. After swallowing it, he waited for a bit, only for the growth to happen again, in which Yoshi became ecstatic with it. Yoshis height expanded and got bigger, which lead to Yoshi just loving the sense of him growing even bigger. Yoshi\u2019s body was expanding faster than it was last time, which lead to Yoshi just anticipating on how much more hes going to grow in size. Yoshi was starting to get taller than some of the trees around his house which made Yoshi wonder how much more hes going to grow by. He considered if he isn\u2019t going to return to normal size, he would probably will eat another one or two and leave the rest for whenever and become a new hero of the Mushroom kingdom or even the world or maybe beyond, so Mario and co. can rest easy and he can put an end to Bowsers constant attacks. Even if this was the case, he would still be who he is known for, a friendly, happy dino rather than be a egotistical showoff hero thinking hes better than everyone. Eventually Yoshi stopped growing and reached the size of 50ft tall, Yoshi would easily tower over Bowser at this size now, not only that, if he did a sneak attack and kidnapped peach, he could take the Mario Bros. to Bowsers castle quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshi didn\u2019t hesitate on eating another Mushroom, he didn\u2019t know why he ever had some before, all those wasted years of never having one or any at all. Yoshi grabbed another Mushroom and chucked it into his mouth ready for another growth session; he sat back down upon swallowing it and got ready to feel his whole body expand once again. He tilted his head back and felt the power of the mushroom going though his body as he started to grow once again, all Yoshi did during this was just make a joyful Yoshi noise to himself, which sounded much deeper due to his size. His height edged towards 65ft tall without any signs of it stopping anytime soon. Yoshi\u2019s size continued to increase as he looked around the area, he could see quite a fair bit into the distance. Yoshi\u2019s size was still expanding as he started to daydream about him being a beloved hero who still had time for his own activities. Yoshi slowly reached the size of 90ft tall, as the effect was starting to slow down, he felt contempt with how big he is for now, with his height ending up just going over 100ft tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshi decided to leave the other Mushrooms later in the event he decides to get bigger, or they wear off eventually for him. Yoshi got up and proceeded to stretch his body feeling how big he has became now. Afterwards he decided to take a small walk around the area in the forest, as he made his way back to the forest, he stopped for a moment, as he started to feel something going on inside him, which started to worry him. Unknown to him, the curse started to take an effect on him. The curse that Kamek put on the mushrooms\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tired footsteps followed suit of the light. Repeating one after another until the turn at the end of the corridor to repeat the process anew. A quick yawn floated from Princess Peach's mouth as she continued down the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaintings of Peach, Toadsworth, Mario, and Luigi all illuminated and darkened when she walked through. Dressed in her rarely seen peachy pink nightgown, Peach\u2019s pursuit for a late night snack was an uncommon event for the royalty, yet tonight was an exception. Before she had a chance to enjoy a slice of cake right after dinner, Toadsworth interrupted with an impromptu need for her to complete a few royal duties. That Toadsworth. Always such a worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Peach rounding the corner and stopped in the kitchen door frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBathed in the moonlight, Peach witness a cilantro herb levitating in the air and landing on a warm, well done steak. She slowly set down the lantern to see two Boos become visible from the surrounding darkness. One gasped and the other stopped in its non-existent tracks. Peach too stood motionless. Quite possibly bewildered by the sight of two ghosts prepared a dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bring the lantern any closer! Please! We're peaceful!\", Peach stopped her advance and looked closer at the spiritual pair. From the looks of it, they didn\u2019t seem to mean any harm.  \"Just who are you anyways? And why are you in my castle?\" Peach asked. The Boos exchanged panicked looks as to indicate which one should start speaking. The one holding the herb cleared his throat. \"We enjoy cooking plenty. Day in and Day out its all we really do. Also, it helps set us apart from the other Boos. We don\u2019t like scaring people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Peach rubbed her smooth chin, \u201cWhy the kitchen here? I\u2019m sure there are plenty of kitchens in town.\u201d One Boo shook its head, \u201cWe would go elsewhere, but none of the kitchens in the kingdom are as good as this one. This kitchen comes really close to the old one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to the old one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt got destroyed along with Bowser\u2019s castle in his last attempt to capture you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach folded her arms and tapped her foot, \u201cAre you trying to say Bowser had a better kitchen than mine? Do you really expect me to believe you? I\u2019ve seen it before and wasn\u2019t impressed.\u201d Peach began to raise the lantern again until one of the Boos threw their arms up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. If you\u2019d have a seat! We'll prove to you that we can cook well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the cautionary part of her knocking on her common sense, the aroma of whatever delicious morsels they cooked has been tickling her nose for the past few minutes. Peach set the lantern down, took a seat, and grabbed the fork. In front of her presented beautifully on a plate is a 36oz, a line of three bread rolls covered in butter, a large mound of mash potatoes, and a side plate of seven eclairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments passed by with Peach doing nothing, but looking at the meal before her, she turned to the Boos who urged her to chow down. \u201cThis sure is a lot of food. It would be rude to not finish it all.\u201d She stabbed into the steak and cut herself a sizable piece and popped it into her mouth. Her taste buds picked up the marinated, smoky flavor of the meat. It was chewy, but not too far as to not be savory as well. As soon as she swallowed she went for another cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 36oz steak diminished slowly, but surely with sensible slices taken from it every few seconds. Periodically, she left the steak alone to eat a roll and take apart the mound of mashed potatoes. All of which complimented each other in taste and texture. Only a short amount of time passed before the only thing left on the plate were the juices from the steak. Peach reclined while she lazily bit on the last eclair. The filling drooped onto her lip which she lethargically licked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach patted her stomach in satisfaction. The meal was as delicious as it was filling, \"Simply impressive! You may stay here as long as you like!\" The Boos smiled, delighted, flashing their big white fangs, \u201cThank you so much, Princess! We love that you liked our meal so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a satisfying meal in her stomach, Princess Peach prepared to get herself to bed as soon as possible. Before she could leave the table\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>      Princess Toadstool had always been revered by her people, not only for her expertise in running the Mushroom Kingdom, but also her very princess-like figure. Nobody, not even the princess herself, knew how she maintained such a svelte hourglass shape, with an almost miniature waist, large yet perky DD cup breasts and a proportionate rear end to accompany them. Although, again, nobody had the foggiest clue of how she kept such a perfect body, Peach figured that whatever she was doing was working, and right now the objective was a midnight snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As the princess made her way through her castle\u2019s halls, the high ceilings of which causing each step of her pink slippers to reverberate distantly yet quietly down the dark walkway, illuminated only by a faint full moon shrouded by storm clouds and the candlelight surrounding the pajama-clad princess. The quiet pitter patter of the rain on the grand windows nearly lulled the princess back to sleep as she made her way to her royal kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The princess was well acquainted with this kitchen, not due to any sort of cooking experience, no that\u2019s what servants are for, but more specifically she was well acquainted with the gargantuan walk-in freezer that may as well have been called a sub-zero warehouse. Her midnight snacking was practically a nightly tradition at this point and this massive repository of almost cryogenically preserved food was the perfect place to grab a bite of virtually anything her royal heart desires, that is so long as she was willing to wait for it to thaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Peach selected a quaint vine of grapes from the fruit section of the well organized food library, running on some kind of culinary equivalent of the Dewey Decimal System. This selection however was not a carefully calculated one, rather a somewhat hasty decision. There was a certain chill in the air of the kitchen, and not just that of the absurdly low temperatures emanating from the still open freezer door, no this was an almost ghastly chill. The kitchen was further inward than the hall she traveled through to get to it, and as such the sprawling tiled floor covered in cooking station after cooking station, designed for maximum efficiency to get out as much food as needed for large-scale banquets, may as well have not been there at all, as the whole room was consumed by darkness, save for the pale moonlit doorway Peach entered through and the dim orange light of her candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As the sleepy Princess watched and waited for the candle-warmed bundle of ice cubes she hoped would be grapes after some thorough melting, she heard what sounded like the clanging of metal across the absurdly long room, coming from the dark abyss barely staved off by her candle. Too frightened to even turn and look, she focused on the almost unchanged over-frozen grapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     A few moments passed in shocked silence as Peach braced for assassination, or something equally terrible. Before long she heard more clattering, and movement in the freezer. The princess could only imagine what horrific creature was making so many sounds. Regaining the ability to move out of sheerly fight or flight responses, Peach made a break for the exit to the kitchen, candle in hand. Just as she reached the square of light casted through the doorway by the moon, the door slammed itself shut. Peach was stuck, stuck with whatever horrible being wanted to keep her there. With nothing left to lose, the princess opened her eyes and turned around, only to find her suspicions had been incorrect. The kitchen was not occupied by an eldritch horror, rather it was buzzing with at least 200 Boos, having a joyous romp with the pots and pans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     A relieved yet still slightly traumatized Peach managed to stop quivering in the corner and watched the Boos toss various meats and spices to one another, boil water using nothing but ectoplasmic energy, and generally make a chaotic mess of things, while still somehow looking organized in the chaos. In truth, the Boos\u2019 choice to make themselves visible filled the room with a pleasant blue glow, illuminating almost every square inch, albeit a bit dimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After about a minute of watching the parade of specters, things seemed to turn south. First one Boo spotted the princess, and of course they told their friend, and so on until at least 50 of them all came together into a much more threatening and much larger version of themselves, cornering the princess while the rest continued cooking. The Big Boo spoke in a surprisingly smooth accent, \u201cAhh, mistress Toadstool! How pleasant that you\u2019re already here! We were worried we may have had to awaken you ourselves, and at such a late hour.\u201d The large spirit knew that it meant no harm... at least not yet, but as if by nature, it\u2019s voice had a hint of an ominous tone. The princess was at a loss for words, however the Boo carried on as if she had responded with the exact words it had expected. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not proper for the receiver of such a glorious feast as the one we are preparing to have to sit and watch the cooks! Please, let my companion escort you to the dining hall. Entertainment awaits!\u201d Peach\u2019s brief confusion was immediately answered by the hypothetical \u201ccompanion\u201d creating itself simply by splitting from the larger ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The Boo was only half as big as the previous yet still far larger than anything Peach could hope to fight, so still somewhat shocked, the princess somewhat absentmindedly allowed the spectral escort to lead her to the dining hall, as if the princess was in the Boos\u2019 castle now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Once Peach entered the dining hall, the thought popped into her head that maybe she <i>was</i> in the Boos\u2019 castle. As she was seated, her own castle looked unfamiliar. Her usually bright chandelier was lit by a couple of dim Peepas stuffed into the lanterns, which illuminated the room surprisingly well. The dinnerware was all hovering around the room with a glowing aura and the \u201centertainment\u201d that was promised was a bunch of haunted instruments shooting through the air playing some sort of off-key concerto. Despite the ghastly nature of it all, Peach actually found it quite pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After a couple of distorted songs, a chorus of screechy voices erupted from the kitchen, \u201cDinner is served!\u201d Just after those three fateful words, hoards of Boos came flying through the back wall dozens at a time, each one carrying at least 5, most of them holding upwards of 7, platters chock full of all sorts of delightful meals. Suddenly Peach remembered what got her swept up in this in the first place, a midnight snack. It had been delayed so much that she was ready to scarf down just about anything, and an expertly cooked smorgasbord was more than enough to fill that criteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Once every last platter had been delivered to the gargantuan table, meant for over 100 people, the whole thing was covered 10 layers high with food. All at once, the Boos howled, \u201cEat up!\u201d similarly to their previous ghastly choir. Immediately, Peach grabbed whatever was at eye level, in this case, a massive roasted turkey. She shoveled meal after meal into her face, without concern for her figure, little did she know that she would be quite happy with the distribution of all those calories anyways. As she ate, each bite seemed to plump her breasts, and strangely not the rest of her body, more and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     By the time Peach had finished the turkey she initially grabbed, her DD cup breasts had already grown to F cups, and her cleavage began spilling over the top of the baggy shirt she wore to bed, and all the while she remained oblivious, as she had already started on her next course.This time a hefty plate of steak and potatoes, she ate ravenously, with it again, drastically increasing her cup size. In less than a minute Peach finished the dish, her F cups now looking like GG cups, her shirt hardly covering her still very thin waist, hardly draping over her belly button, and despite being completely natural her huge breasts were absurdly perky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After 2 meals Peach had had enough, and just as she was about to get out of her chair and thank the Boos for their meal, 2 of them grabbed her by the arms and pulled her back into the chair. \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d \u201c We didn\u2019t make all of this just so you could eat 2 of them!\u201d \u201cCome on, we\u2019ll just feed you!\u201d Each of the Boos chimed in to the conversation, and although Peach couldn\u2019t make out any one particular statement, the general consensus was clear. She was eating this buffet.</span></div></div>",

She pulled it from the shelf and attempted to read the cover, however the book seemed very old and worn out, as all she could make out was \"body\". Rosalina stared at the book, trying to remember where it came from, she took the book to her bedroom, to look for the answer in a more comfortable environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Rosalina said to herself \"nice and cozy, now to see what lies within this book.\" She opened time cover to find an encyclopedia of spells.

She looked down at herself, seeing a round orange ball where her body was. Wendy, seeing her belly poke out further than normal, was filled with shock. Within seconds of wondering how it could've happened, she remembered the spell that Ludwig cast, realizing what it actually meant to 'become part of your greatness'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!

The guard became the hardest shaker that ever existed, with buckets of sweat pouring down his face. Wendy approached him while extending her finger to him, making him lean away to shake and sweat harder than ever. Her claw grazed his beak, absorbing him into the very point. The guard struggled to escape but his entirety was soon sucked through her claw, into the young lady's already increased bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her body took in the mass, Wendy hugged her belly with pride and giggled a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, look at me, </i> she thought. <i>I'm already becoming quite the queen.

She went over to her full length mirror and admired herself- trying out a few poses as she flaunted her pudgy body. \"I look as perfect as ever!\" she declared, winking and blowing a kiss to her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The spoiled koopaling was so steeped in her own vanity, that she refused to acknowledge the bloated belly she now sported. She'd been in denial about her weight for a while now without even realizing it, from her plump chest to her thick thighs and doughy oversized rump, the effects of her indulgence had made her quite chubby over time. That combined with how few calories she burned, since she absolutely despised exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Still, eating an entire double decker cake by herself in one sitting was new for her. Far more than a box of chocolates or a few cookies here and there. If anything was going to make her realize that she was getting fat, it would've been this. But- no. She still viewed her figure as ideal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I shouldn't be afraid to treat myself more,\" she mused, licking her plump lips, \"that cake was really delicious- and I almost didn't let myself have all of it! It didn't even mess up my figure!\" she said, suddenly not feeling so full anymore. \"In fact...\" she started to say, grinning, \"I think I'll treat myself again right now!\" And with that, Wendy headed back to the kitchen- to order herself another snack or two!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Wendy arrived back at the kitchen, the first worker she spotted was...</span></div></div>",

Also, I've been told I do fried chicken well- same with burgers and fries, a nice diner style meal! Oh, and hot dogs- if any of that sounds appealing to you?\" It asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy grinned, clapping her hands. \"That's perfect! I'd like some of all of that right away!\" She decided, \"bring it all up to my room as soon as you're done cooking it, along with a milkshake and some soda to wash it down!\" She said, licking her plump lips in anticipation, before turning her back on the surprised boo, allowing it to see her oversized doughy butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ok!

Everything you asked for.\" The boo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was surprised- it was a lot of food!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peach, Daisy and Rosalina were hanging out in Peach's room at the castle. Since it was getting late everyone was getting ready to go to bed and had changed into their pajamas, t-shirts and comfy pants. Just as the girls were going to say goodnight and head back to their own rooms Toadette bursts into the room holding a large sac slung across her shoulder. Before she could even speak, the other girls noticed something different about the toad. Where she once had a generally petite frame, she now had 2 massive DD tits on her chest and a bulging stomach just poking out from under her shirt. \"Oh my, what happened to you Toadette? You seem... bigger.\" Peach asked, concerned about her friend. \"Oh, these\" Toadette pushed her shoulders together to accentuate her new found bust. \"These came from these new mushrooms I was given by a magikoopa at the market today. They're supposed to be a mix of a 1-up and a super mushroom but after I ate one all I found is that it makes your boobs grow a ton. I figured you girls might want to try 'em out\". \"Thanks 'n all but I don't think Peach was just talking about your titties. Your gut's also looking pretty fat\" Daisy said as she poked Toadette's swollen middle, finding it abnormally hard. Toadette brushed this off \"The magikoopa just said that was a side effect of the mushrooms. Eventually the stomach goes down but the boobs stay forever. It's really not that bad, it does feel a little tingly though and I occasionally feel like I'm going to throw up but it's short term pain for long term gain\" Toadette jiggled her boobs again as she took another pink mushroom out of the bag and ate it. \"Alright, can't be that bad.\" Said Daisy, \"Let's give it a shot!\". \"Oh... ok.\" Peach responded hesitantly. \"I'm really not so sure about this.\" Rosalina spoke for the first time since Toadette came in. \"Magikoopas normally work with Bowser and aren't to be trusted.\" \"Don't be such a drag.\" replied Daisy, \"You of all people could use a boost in the boobs department anyway\" Daisy squeezed Rosalina's tiny breasts making her blush. \"WE'RE DOING THIS!\" Daisy exclaimed. </span></div></div>",
