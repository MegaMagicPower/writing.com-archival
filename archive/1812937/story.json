His red hair was kept shaven and his facial hair neatly cleaned which added to the blandness of the black and white suit all students were expected to wear. The only noticeable difference between him and another male student was the pale yellow neck tie, students were permitted to wear their own neckties and not the plain uniform black ones given to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, man, I can't talk about it. Especially not in school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Is it illegal?\" I smirked, eyeing the robotic teacher at the front of the class that was programmed to monitor everyone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what's the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Attention male students: Eric Vandervale, Aaron Shywater.

I just rolled my eyes. We knew we both could afford another two demerits on our student records, but I decided to drop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince last week, when Aaron had gotten his supposed job, he had been extremely quiet around me. Normally we would always hang with each other after class and find some way to cause trouble to entertain ourselves. After he had been hired though, he rarely even had time to speak. He always said he was \"busy working\", though he never did go into much detail after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had made it my mission to discover where it was he was working so I could hang out with him more, Aaron seemed to think I was doing it to pester him though. But really it was because I was concerned about the line of work he might be doing. He was the only guy I had as a friend, most of the other \"male students\" as the robotic faculty called us hated my guts because I was a womanizer and was the crush of many girls in our class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should probably have given a brief introduction to myself though. My name is Eric Vandervale. I'm currently in my sixteenth year of schooling here in 0028 Institute, meaning I'd be a junior in high school if I translated it to pre-jump times. 0028 isn't a random number, it's a ranking. The school is the twenty eighth best institute for high learning, according to the government. It's pretty high up there, considering the numbers go into four digits. My family was part of the more influence members in the corporations when the technology jump happened, so we're very well off and were able to get me into this school. Though I'm considered somewhat on the thick side by my parents, both my brothers had gone to 0002 and 0004 schools respectively while I never cared much for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" whispered Aaron. \"Eric, can you spare a pen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited for the robotic teacher to scan in another direction before tossing Aaron one of my spare pens. Aaron was a good guy, if shy. He was certainly a lot smarter than me, but he'd never admit it. His biggest fault was that he was always a perfectionist, meaning he'd spend hours working on one math problem until he got it spot on even if he'd never get to the others in time to complete a test. Unlike my family, Aaron came from a generally poor family that struggled to even keep him here which was why I was somewhat relieved to hear he had found a job after school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I fiddled around with my other pens while Aaron continued to take notes, what sounded like an air raid alarm rang out in the halls outside the classroom. The usual mechanical voice of the robot teacher blared out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Time period 'Study Hall' concluded. Students are required to vacant the room. The Board of Education seeks to remind students that any illegal activity after school hours that may deface the reputation of the Institute will-</span></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the poor robot was quickly overwhelmed by the sudden rush of students trying to push their way to the door to escape the dank dark cell of a room. I tried to keep my eye on Aaron as we made our way to our lockers. It was usually during this after school rush that I lost him while he made his way to work. This time I tried my best to keep an eye on his shaven red head but eventually lost it under the crowd of similarly shaven heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit...\" I muttered, kicking my locker when I came to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't think Aaron would have the guts to do something really illegal for a job, no matter how desperate his family was for money. He knew he could always ask me for help after all. But he certainly was hiding something and his behavior was only getting more awkward by the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I threw my bag into the locker, I slammed it shut not caring if it locked or not. I then headed outside to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the bus was still there and loading up with other students, I figured spending a few hours cramped in a flying metal tin can would not be the best thing to improve my mood. The weather seemed to be reflecting my attitude, clouds and darkness matched the unvarying skyscrapers as flying cars buzzed around the tops like a swarm of bees. A walk through the lower city might help clear my anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I saw...</span></div></div>",

I almost started to run towards it before thinking about the flying cars screeching past at every altitude, including ground level. If I hadn't glanced behind me at exactly the right moment, I would never have seen him. Aaron must have gone out the front of the institute with the crowd and doubled around to the back. I had thought he was acting suspicious before, but now I was convinced. He knows nobody goes out of the school that way - everybody knows that. There's a no-fly zone around most of the school, and even then, most flying cars are up so high that they're not a danger to anyone. The 0028 institute, though, is pushed right up against the access flyway of the industrial zone next door, and flying cars are crammed in it at every level all day until the zone shuts down at night. I was getting very confused as I put two and two together. It was already evening, and the zone was shutting down soon - so what business did Aaron in there? On top of that, he's still a student, so I know he's not certified to do any industrial labor at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all these things were running through my head, the elevator he was in began moving... down? No building has basements anymore. The radiation levels only go up the further you go down. Now I was really worried - and Aaron was getting away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me - Sorry, I-\" I immediately turned around and pushed against the crowd still pouring out of the Institute's imposing, featureless facade. Shaved heads passed on every side as I moved towards the speeding wall of flying cars, moving almost as fast as my racing thoughts. How was I going to get past that? It didn't look like there was a crosswalk tunnel anywhere. How did Aaron get through? Aaron! All I could see now is his head moving down with the elevator!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Attention male student: Eric Vandervale.

I should have realized that moving against the crowd would have drawn it's attention to me, even without running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! I'm slowing down!\" I yelled, raising my arms. \"I'm going slowly now. Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the flyway, I groaned in frustration: the lift was back in it's spot, devoid of Aaron. I walked, well below the campus speed limit I might add, to the edge of the flyway. Cars were still flying by at breakneck speed. Running might work if I could time it right, but if I didn't... I swallowed with a dry throat. It might be best just to walk home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to...</span></div></div>",

Up close, the traffic definitely had gaps in it large enough to run through as long as I timed them right. Aaron's behavior had been bugging me all week. I glanced up and down the flyway, shifting back and forth and getting in position to dash across. A gap was coming up soon. I pushed forward on one foot, and almost put my other foot in front - I saw the cars whiz by in my peripheral vision, and choked myself back. The wind rushed  by over my scalp as the cars barreled past. I eyed the elevator across the road, and steeled myself again. I could see another gap in the traffic, bigger than the last one, and I wasn't going to miss it. Three... two... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One!\" I shouted as I lunged forward and squeezed my eyes shut - If I was going to die, I didn't want to see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could taste the polluted air filling my lungs as I ran across, feel the scrunch of the hard flyway tarmac, until I could feel the ground was plain concrete again. I let myself collapse on the smooth ground, and I started to laugh a little at the crazy thing I had just done. That was not normal, and that was not something I should have done, but I felt exhilarated. It must be Aaron's behavior getting to me... something about Aaron lately had been different. Even though he wouldn't talk to me, he just seemed more... alive. Well, now, I though to myself as I looked purposefully at the elevator, I was going to find out. I got up and walked purposefully to the standard sliding glass door to the elevator. Strange... especially in an industrial zone like this, I would have expected it to have some form of biological identifier to keep unwanted visitors out. But, hey - If I wasn't unwanted, I was wanted! As I got closer, the door slid open for me, and I stepped inside. There was nothing unusual about the elevator so far; standard single light, blank gunmetal walls. The button panel, though, had only one button, with a symbol I didn't recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2615<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A... bowl? No, an... antique cup. One from the old days: a curved cup, with a round handle on the side - imagine - and three squiggly line coming from out from the top. Snakes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged and pushed my finger firmly on the button, and the elevator began to move down. I watched quietly through the glass panel as the ground moved up, taking everything I knew with it. I was starting to think this wasn't a good idea. Who knew what was down here? The sidewalk ground was quickly replaced with the layer of radiation shields under the walk - metal, probably 20 feet thick this far into the ground. It would need to be, to protect everyone up top, at least from what I knew from history class. I shivered a bit. I hope the shields cover this underground structure, as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the elevator stopped, and the metal in front of the glass slid open. My first look at Aaron's place of work: brick walls? A wooden counter top for a front desk? I unconsciously let my mouth drop a little. I had only seen these things in the school datacentre's digital encyclopaedia. And behind the counter... My jaw finally dropped all the way open. There was a woman standing there with shoulder length hair - that is, much longer than the standard shaved heads I had seen all my life. It was dark, blackish, almost dark enough to be blue, with a gloss reflecting the warm light from the antique filament lightbulb. Then the glass separating me from this strange apparition slid open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Eric.\" She spoke with a voice that was easily comfortable and commanding at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snapped my mouth shut. She gave a little sigh and shake of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron said to look out for someone of your description, in case he was followed...\" She narrowed her eyes by only a centimeter, and it was still terrifying. \"You <i>are</i> Eric, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded my head, maybe too quickly: \"Yes - Vandervale. Eric... Vandervale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" She nodded her head slowly, relaxedly, and I watched as the steely menace smoothed out of her face in an instant, replaced with a calm, slight smile. She walked around the counter, and right up to the elevator, which made me very conscious of the fact that I hadn't moved an inch since I saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ann, by the way.\" She held out her hand with the fingers outstretched in a friendly manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached out and wrapped my hand around mine - and she unexpectedly pulled me closer, leaning in to speak in a low voice into my ear:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to decide, right now. If you go right back up that elevator, and <i>never, ever come back,</i> that'll be it. But if you decide to come see what we sell in here, you are...\" She chuckled a bit to herself, and I couldn't tell whether to feel excited or afraid. \"You are going to find yourself doing something here that you spend a large amount of your time doing. And when you're not here, you will be thinking about being here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned back, and stood with her piercing, strangely comforting eyes looking straight at mine. That small smile was back on her face, but her dress shoe was tapping slowly on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What'll it be?\"</span></div></div>",

When we got to the main counter, Ann turned back towards me.<br>\r\n\"Now, normally this kind of thing would cost some money, but I'm willing to make an exception for you, <i>forever</i>, if you decide to work here with your friend.\"<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Aaron walked out, carrying what appeared to be a bag of black shells. He stopped dead in his tracks once he set it down and turned to face me.<br>\r\n\"Eric! What... are you doing here... isn't there still school?\" He stated rather meekly.<br>\r\n\"Relax, Aaron, I was just offering your friend a job here, and all that entails. You know that we need the manpower to keep money rolling in. Besides, I sense a rebellious streak in this one, which is perfect for an establishment like this.\"<br>\r\n\"Very well, I accept. So, tell me how this place works?\"<br>\r\n\"That,\" Ann replied, \"would take too long, but let me just say that if you take a drink, you can become practically anyone you wish, and live for a bit in their shoes. You can get free coffee after hours, and serve drinks and keep order during operational hours. Don't worry about your parents, by the way, I will personally make sure that are fine with you being here. Other than that, your pay is determined by how much you sell. Also, I would like for you to start today. Is all of that clear?\"<br>\r\n\"yes, of course. So what would you have me do?\" I responded, both stunned and impressed with how this business operated.

Howrever, the human beings being chosen to be slaves didn't belong to a single race, but rather a single social class: <br>\r\nFirst:the less fortunate ones.In the last ten years, raises of prices and taxes and the  basic salary dropping drove the middle class to extinction,leaving a gap between the rich and poor. The less fortunate ones, lost their homes and didn't have enought money to buy food. To gain food and shelter people of the less fortunate class have to be assigned to people of the rich class and work for them until the end of their lives.<br>\r\nTabbitha was one of those new age slaves. The 20 year old young woman was in the service of a rich familly who threated her like she was trash.No matter how hard and how well she did her job,they always found an excuse to say she didn't do her job well and insult her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut little did she know that her life would soon change.<br>\r\nOne day, as Tabby came back from the market with the food she bought for her master, she got lost.<br>\r\nIn an alley she found something on the wall of a nearby building: A button with the image of a coffee mug on it. Curious,she pressed on the button.<br>\r\nThe wall opened,revealing  an elevator.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The nightly news programs on CNN, Fox, and other networks, have shown the more normal population what others have chosen to become to fancy their lusts or grant them a new vocation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysaila was a call-girl, a dancer, as well she had sold her soul to Professor Haun, a renown scientist. The Professor was well known for his Reformation process, he able to cause minor or drastic changes to a person and their body. Many at the shop had read about Professor Haun and his partner, a Professor Beaker, their original claims of fame came via the Dartmoor Pony society. Professor Haun had some eight to ten years hence procured various people, those down on their luck, divorcees, orphans, and government criminals, the evil people that equally evil governments wished to be rid of, but not leaving any stray bodies for human right groups to dig up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany customers in the shop if asked would remember the story told In major magazines, of a college student named Daniel, and his being the primary test subject in an experiment sponsored in part by the Dartmoor Society. Reformation serum, Professor Haun, and Daniel worked together, as caused a young man human to become a prime, pedigree, stallion, Dartmoor breed pony animal. The story was a blockbuster, giving views about Daniel when he was as all a pony animal, he became the herd-sire stud to a pony farm based in Great Britain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysaila was not that important of a personage, although due to her letting Professor Beaker apply the Reformation serum to her body, she became a rare breed of Anthropic design, she as part Sheep, and in part still a beautiful face she being a voluptuous woman. Scantly dressed, her sheep wool used by her to cover various body parts, while wearing moderate clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig blue eyes took a checked look around the shop before Lysaila dared to smile.</font></span></div></div>",

Well, allow me to explain. It's the year 2042. Technology has advanced exponentially in the last thirty years but as we grew scientifically, we lost some important things along the way. Art, democracy, freedoms...Since the new government took over ten years ago we've been forced to live bland lives. Everyone works without a smile; there's no joy in anyone's life, no hidden pleasure, no fantasies, no life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's where I came up with a fun little idea. Since everyone seems to think the grass is always greener on the other side, I established an underground caf\u00e9 that let's anyone live a day in someone else's shoes! Thus Someone Else's Shoes became the trade name, using a special blend of coffee you can become anyone you desire. Of course, such activities are illegal in the eyes of the law (identity theft and such) and since I had no desire to harbor crime in my coffeehouse, there are several rules that remain in effect at all times. These rules also protect people's identities and encourage friendships plus communication!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><b><i>Someone Else's Shoes House Rules:</i></b></span><br>\r\n<i>1. No one may leave the house while transformed.</i><br>\r\n<i>2. You may not ask who someone's true identity is while in the house.</i><br>\r\n<i>3. Helping someone will earn you a free coffee.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from that...Sit back and enjoy your stay. Socialize and use your time as someone else wisely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Ann, Proprietor of Someone Else's Shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey guys, this is a serious/fun story I decided to work on. Please, feel free to have fun with it and take it places. Just be sure to keep the story within the house rules listed beforehand at all times. That's the point of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, thanks for reading and I hope you add some interesting chapters.</td>",
