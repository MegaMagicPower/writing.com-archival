The end of the War, the Royal Wedding and the unification of Zofia and Rigel. Of course this was simply a smaller version of the original but it wasn't the event Alm wanted to recall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at himself in that image. Merely a few months ago, he was smiling and posing with his friends and new wife, hot of the heels of war. His trained physique that got them through without casualties, honed and steeled by Mycen, left him with almost a six pack of abs and muscular arms and legs. That armour fit him like a glove. Not anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it's true people can outgrow clothes, especially armour, in very short time spans but that growth is usually upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlm was always a big eater. He was never allowed outside Ram village so food was one of the few ways he could experience the world. Every taste was a new adventure. Even when full, he would crave just a bit more. He needed it then, to keep us his strength when training and when fighting in the War. Celica often teased him of this habit claiming he, \"Could put away more than their friends combined.\" or, \"He should leave some for other people.\" At the time, he simply chuckled...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs King, Alm had many duties, a lot of which just involved sitting around saying yes or no. It wasn't the most strenuous of activities but he had to do it. Even when he decided to help clear out some bandits, he was returned to the castle for his safety and other boring jobs. He never got to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the food was good. At his first banquet as King, rumours have it he was silent the majority of the night. Well, mostly silent. Sounds of chewing and swallowing could be found in his direction all night and, as the night progressed, pained groans from an abused stomach. Things hadn't quite been the same since then. He was offered more food than usual and those same pained moans were heard more often. He couldn't help it. So many new foods, his mouth watered even simply thinking back. He restrained himself to address the problems these combined had on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>But how fat was he?</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He stared into the mirror. Who was that fat man in briefs? Him. It was always him. He hoped everyday that it might just go away but it never did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlm recalled a boat trip with Gray and Tobin a while back. Just the three of them, like old times. A boat in the middle of a lake, no land or other people in sight. They had gone fishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them quite anticipated the heat. Any warmer and the fish may have been cooked for them. Gray and Tobin removed their shirts to cool off but Alm was reluctant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobin's body hosted finely sculpted abs with muscular arms. It was clear he'd been training to join the military since the end of the war. Gray, while not at the level of Tobin, also had abs made in keeping up with his new wife Clair who, unexpectedly, was more fit than he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You not too warm in that?\" Gray asked Alm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, don't worry.\" Alm lied. In reality, he was incredibly hot but dared not remove his shirt. He didn't know why, he just didn't want to. Despite this, the sweat pouring from his face told his friends otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon. Nobody out here but us. You'll overheat.\" Tobin tried to reason with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, honesty.\" He lied once more, fixated on fishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two nodded to each other and smirked, knowing the other's thought. Together, Gray and Tobin yanked Alm's shirt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Alm was startled at the sudden movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friends couldn't help but stifle laughter. Unlike both of them, Alm's abs had vanished. Instead, a small, pudgy belly rested on his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess being King isn't all that healthy.\" Alm looked at his torso and for the first time realised he wasn't working off his weight. He poked it to make sure it was real and it was. He regretted it shortly after as his friends began doing the same, prodding and patting his poor belly. Alm felt every jiggle, every finger sink in slightly and every wave each pat sent along his chub. It was almost as if his friends were mesmerised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the way it... jiggles...\" Tobin wobbled it with his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you stop that?\" Alm grabbed his shirt from the fascinated duo who promptly snapped back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah. Sorry.\" Gray apologised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip was very silent after that but that day Alm realised he was getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at himself, he placed his palm on his belly and shook it. Each day, he was juxtaposing himself more and more with Celica's father, King Lima, before his death. While Lima looked skinny and almost sickly, Alm was approaching large in boxers getting too tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms and legs had softened and thickened slightly and his behind filled out his underwear almost too well. His pectorals, while not quite moobs, had softened. While mercy was taken on his face, no expense was spared for his belly. It wasn't too large but for Alm it felt massive. It was soft and jiggled slightly when moved but retaining an almost inflated shape. It was awful.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I've never read most of these myself. Looks to be dark magic. The fabled Goetia, perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tobin and I have been looking for this for ages.\" Gray replied, grasping the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll remind you,\" Kliff climbed down the ladder he was on, \"Anyone can use dark magic but without the proper training, it can have catastrophic results when done wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. I know.\" Gray responded, leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want that back, don't forget, so don't lose it like all the other things you've borrowed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I won't lose this one.\" He left to join Tobin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you said about my staff. Seriously, why do I keep trusting them?\" Kliff grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!

We're meeting at the dock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you'll be fine on your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alm, I didn't cover half of the continent just to be foiled by Queen-ly duties.\" Celica assured her husband. \"Everything will be fine here. Mae and Boey will be here and I hear they're expecting their first child. Exciting, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe, for all their bickering, they wound up together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica giggled, \"Oh well. You just enjoy your weekend with Gray and Tobin. I've heard they've been looking forward to it for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So have I. It's a chance to finally do something different without being hounded by servants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alm arrived at the dock, he found his friends waiting for him. He had organised one of Valentia's finer vessels. Not too grand as to make themselves targets for pirates but large enough to house all of them. It was Tobin's idea to sail out somewhere into the ocean and float there for a while. Relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys ready?\" Alm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boarded the ship and sailed out to sea. Tobin sailed the ship while Gray dropped off their stuff in their rooms. He made sure to grab the book and brought it to Tobin on the deck, both knowing what the weekend would hold for them and Alm's body.</span></div></div>",

The sea around Valentia was blessed by Mila while she ruled over the land and was known for how calm it became. You could sail for nearly a week and boats would still sit gently. Picking a random spot, they anchored the ship into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first. It's going to get late soon so let's just enjoy our first day. Wait for Alm to go to bed and then the main event starts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sun was already departing over the horizon but it wasn't nearly night yet. It was warm and the sky glowed orange. The two got changed into a pair of shorts and sat on the main deck, watching the Sun go down. To their surprise, Alm decided to join them. More surprising still, in shorts like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat on one of the chairs in between them where both got a view of his marvellous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for this, guys. I really needed to get away for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTobin wondered how much he could eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being King is harder work than I thought but this helps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray considered when the button on his shorts would pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And thanks for not commenting on my weight. I've been thinking about it a lot recently but it's nice to finally relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sun finally set over the horizon and the day slowly fell into night, as did Alm into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this Tobin got up and wobbled his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? You're going to wake him up!\" Gray whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. He sleeps like a rock. I made sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cast a spell without me! No fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares? Besides, you gotta try this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray, while still a bit angry, also got up and poked Alm's belly. His finger sunk in a fair amount.

Only his belly pressed forward, leaving his relatively skinny body behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray laughed and gripped the inflating belly, kneading the flesh pushing around his hand,  \"Someone's let themselves go.\" Tobin went to strike him but was halted by a sharp pain.

When first crowned exalt, he was swarmed by people who wanted to meet him, usually shooed away by his younger sister Lissa who just wanted some breathing room, Chrom had made sure since that the people treat him as an equal, not a superior, as he did not believe in people being treated differently due to where they came from, a mind-set proven with Robin and, as he later learned, shared by a Valmese noble hundreds of years ago named Lady Clair. Now the people simply let him be but still recognised him as exalt which admittedly caused some business to give him freebies, most of which he would have turned down but didn't really have a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets were quiet today. Usually, they'd be busy with vendors and other shop keeps trying to sell their wares to the mass of crowds but not today. Many people were probably spending time relaxing at home and the children would be at school. Even the Shepherds who, due to the lack of brigands and the reigning peace, were reduced to the local police force, weren't anywhere to be seen, a fact that Chrom could only chalk up to Frederick's training which he insisted, \"would be vital to maintain physical condition should the peace ever be broken!\" The exalt chuckled at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom once again placed a hand on his stomach. What was that weird wave that came over him? He didn't feel any different now. Maybe it was just the cold sending a shiver down him. No, the sun was shining bright and it wasn't a very cold day. Perhaps a breeze? Unlikely. Robin's study didn't have any windows and the door was closed. What about the spell? Could Robin have accidently cast it on him? What did it say, something about being fulfilled and events resetting? The details of the spell seemed to unravel every time he tried to remember it. No, no, no... Robin was a skilled magician, he wouldn't haphazardly cast spells. Still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in his thoughts, Chrom realised he had forgotten to look for a restaurant. That was the whole reason he was here. It was odd though, he wasn't hungry he just fancied something to eat. No, he wanted to eat. No, he was compelled to eat. While before his thoughts wandered, he could now only think of food. Chicken, bread, cakes. His mouth watered and he rubbed his stomach in anticipation, an action he was completely unaware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spotted two restaurants down the street and hurried inside one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich restaurant did he go in?</span></div></div>",

The restaurant was empty, much like the streets outside. A waiter came up to greet the exalt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, your Highness. It's such an honour to have you dine here. Let me show you to your table.\" The waiter showed Chrom to a table near the buffet, \"Please grab a plate and help yourself whenever you are ready. Don't worry about paying afterwards, it's on the house. I will leave you to eat in peace.\" And with that, he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom went over to the buffet and grabbed a plate. The food along the counter looked as good as it smelled. He began piling his plate with all sorts of foods. Chicken, beef, roast potatoes, it all got added to the mountain of food. When he finally set it down upon the table and sat down, it almost obscured his view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started shovelling food into his mouth like a man on a mission. It was all so good, he couldn't help himself. Every morsel was emptied into his mouth. He didn't bother with knives or forks, instead opting to throw it in his mouth with his bare hands. Before long, all was consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he wanted more. He stood back up and returned to the buffet. An idea struck him. He grabbed a second plate. He piled it up as well, returning to his table and repeating the ritual, cramming as much food into his mouth as possible. One hand tore through the first plate while the other demolished the second. It didn't take him long to finish his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned back and belched. Done. He placed one of his hand on his full belly. Wait, belly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Chrom now had a rather sizeable gut. It was large and heavy. It had forced his shirt up to the point where a tiny line of flesh stared out into the unknown world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he wanted to simply lie there and sleep off his meal, he couldn't let the people know what a glutton he had been. He quietly got up and made his way through the empty streets to the castle, using back alleys to avoid public gaze.</span></div></div>",

She was most certainly his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut since, Ophelia had decided to wander the world on her own, seeking new adventures and promising to write often. There were even rumours spread back to the capital that an eccentric beauty would appear like a flash in dire times and disappear just as quickly. He couldn't be more proud of his little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina, having been appointed Exalt, was leading the reconstruction of the country. A new memorial was constructed outside the castle, listing all the names of those lost in the war. Reports say she'd sneak away at some point everyday to pay her respects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, he was busy, so she appreciated the moments she could sit down and have a delightful chat with her cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut those moments were few and far between recently, leaving Owain bored if naught else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had tried to be of help but all positions that Lucina needed had already been appointed and, while she was thankful for it in her downtime, Owain's dramatics weren't so useful when she was trying to concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Lucina busy and Ophelia elsewhere, it felt as if life had come to a halt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so bored. So, he'd decided to go on a little adventure of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA disguise unbeknownst to the people of the world in a dense jungle, ripe with danger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wore his \"Odin\" outfit and was exploring a forest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twig snapped. He was being followed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt, Villain! Or prepare to feel the wrath of Odin Dark!\" He turned and assumed a battle stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange fluffly bandit was startled and hopped away, nutty bounty in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squirrel. He knew that, of course...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But a loud, threatening announcement was sure to scare off any <i>potential</i> attackers. Yeah, sure, that was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before he came across an small hut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls were weak and the woodwork was crumbling. The paint on the walls had gone yellow and was peeling off slightly. The windows were littered with cobwebs and the door was only hung by a single hinge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't look like anyone had been living here for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old, abandoned cottage, just the place to spark a daring adventure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside didn't look any better off than the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was furnished but most of it was broken and covered in webs. None of the books on the bookshelf had legible titles, all masked in dust. Even the bugs, that you might think had the run of this place, seemed to have been long dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing caught his eye, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wooden pedestal in the centre of the room, holding up a book, also dusty beyond belief. It was already open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain blew the dust away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the veil was an assortment of spells; some good, some bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were ones that made hair longer, others that killed a man by thrusting his legs through their mouth, and others that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain frantically flicked through, barely stopping to read any of the pages. He was like a kid in a candy store. But he didn't notice the door open behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you! Brat! What are you doing in my home?\" An incredibly elderly lady stood hunched in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain turned, surprised. The turning pages gently settled a bit further ahead in the book. \"O-Oh, sorry ma'am, I di-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my baby!\" She interrupted him and hobbled to the pedestal, shoving Owain out of the way, \"The bad man didn't hurt you did he?\" She cradled the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-uh... I'll be going then...\" Owain slowly shuffled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!\" She snapped her fingers and Owain was thrown upside down and dangled from the ceiling by his ankles, \"You barge into my home, make a mess of my belongings and assault my poor, little baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a book.\" Owain merely responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHE'S MY PRECIOUS ANGEL! Now, how to punish you...\" She surveyed the room but stopped when she gazed back upon her 'baby', \"Yes, yes...\" She picked the book up and glanced down the page with a devilish grin, it made Owain feel uncomfortable, well, more uncomfortable. \"If this is truly what you desire, who am I to say to can't have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mumbled something in a language Owain didn't understand and pressed her long, spindly finger against Owain's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sent a strange wave through his body, but it felt different in his stomach, where the feeling began. He couldn't help but giggle a little. It tickl... tic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes felt incredibly heavy and his thoughts went hazy. It wasn't long before he found himself lulled into sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lucina was hunched over him, concern panned across her face. She smiled once he came to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you quite alright?\" She offered him a hand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\" He was still struggling to piece together a concrete thought, \"What are you doing out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Out here'?\" She seemed confused, \"If you were on another adventure, you didn't go very far. The castle's just over that hill.\" It would explain why the forest looked pretty familiar, \"The better question is why were you on the floor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you won't believe it.\" He started, \"I found this old cottage and then there was this book with these really cool spells and then this crazy lady came in and she got mad at me and then she-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down, Owain.\" She gestured for emphasis, \"A cottage. In these woods?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! C'mon, I'll show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I've got a few minutes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I'm telling you, it was right here!\" The cottage Owain had found earlier was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you didn't hit your head and dream the whole thing up?\" Lucina asked, \"I can get Brady to look at it for you if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it was here. This isn't just some story, I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina could see the despair in his face. Owain's confidence was fragile, it'd been that way since... since <b>she</b> died, \"I-I believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Now why don't you come back to the castle? I've got a meeting to attend shortly but we can talk again later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina wasn't a very good liar. It was nice of her to spare his feelings but Owain could tell she didn't truly believe him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was there, wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwain sat in his room. Lucina had insisted he and Ophelia stay with her at the castle when he came back from that other world. It was probably pretty lonely since it was just her beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat on his bed with a stack of spell books beside him. He'd been trying to see if he could find a spell similar to the one that was cast on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet he had no such luck. He couldn't even find any records on the language she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was all a dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he remembered the feeling of the spell so vividly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt as if his body was limp and relaxed and his mind was hazy and clouded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his stomach felt different entirely. It felt as if her finger pressed deep into him despite only lightly resting on the surface. And it felt so empty and sensitive. So sensitive it even caused him to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough perhaps that was all due to his outfit. His suit didn't exactly cover up his stomach very well, enabling her to touch his skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poked his flat stomach considering this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response, his stomach gurgled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, of course, he'd be hungry. It was past lunch and he hadn't had anything to eat today yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the books, he got up and stretched, prompting another moan from his middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, be patient, buddy. We'll get you nice and filled up.\" He patted his stomach for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle's chefs would always be willing to make him something. It was their job after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only choice was whether to eat it in the hall or bring it back to his room.</span></div></div>",

Was he dreaming?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belt felt a little snug, perhaps put on a tad too tight this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands moved to adjust it to something more comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, getting to his belt, his hands slid past a weird object and it startled him upon looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly was forcing its way outwards from his form. His previous physique was already gone in favour of a small gut, continually expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his stomach with his palms, as if trying to keep it contained. But it was working as well as his outfit's efforts, for which the gap down the middle of his torso had forced the two sides of the outfit further and further back, forming tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack!\" Owain yelped in pain as his belt began to really dig into him. He attempted to fumble with the constrictor, to relieve himself of the pressure but it was too late, as his now sizeable gut cast an impassable shade over his lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, SNAP! Oh, what a relief. The belt, designed for Owain's skinnier frame, had split and landed on the floor beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth slowed and then stopped. Leaving Owain with a sigh of relief and a very large and heavy gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was if someone had chained him and fed him relentlessly for hours on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A nice start, but shouldn't we make it bigger?\" A strange voice cam from nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...?\" Owain looked about to see another man, one who looked eerily similar to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm you, an inner you, an inner you awoken by the spell.\" He came over and began to caress Owain's belly, \"And we're going to make this bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? But I thought you liked this feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like...\" His words trailed off as he looked at his inner self and then back to your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you like this feeling?\" He grinned deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I like this feeling...\" The bloated original slurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't it be great to have a large belly all of our own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Owain's personality began to shine back through, but with a noticeable change, \"Yes, I, Owain Dark, will have the largest, heaviest, most breath-taking belly in Ylisse! I shall devote myself, day and night, not to the sword but to the belly, forcing delicious morsels down my throat in hopes to be so big I cannot even move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy.

No name. No further information. Just a note and some pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the pie. He knew better than to eat strange food. It smelled good though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cut a slice from the pie. Cherry, or at least it looked like it. No signs of poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe just a tiny bit. To check for poison. If it was, then he wouldn't eat anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, maybe it wasn't the most fool proof plan but it looked and smelled so nice he just had to try at least a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a small bite from the slice he picked. It was nice. So nice in fact that he finished off the rest of the slice as quickly as he could. Maybe it was just made by some kind person and he was just being silly. He chuckled to himself about his own paranoia before finishing the piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll put it away for later and share the rest with Lilina.\" Roy thought before noticing he was halfway through a second slice. He must have just been a bit hungrier than he thought. Oh well, he'll just put the remaining four sli- no wait, three slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking about that second slice, he had finished it and absent-mindedly picked up a third before chewing on it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the last one, he thought. He was starting to get a bit full. Finishing that slice, he sat down before his hand once again crept up to the basket the pie was in and reached for another slice. He hadn't meant to but it was so nice he couldn't help himself. He downed it too before leaning back and sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more. That's it. Full. He couldn't eat anoth- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe he could. He had picked up both remaining slices and was in the process of stuffing himself with one. He didn't particularly want to eat anymore but there was something about this pie he just couldn't resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finishing both slices, Roy noticed something odd...</span></div></div>",

A position of great power, though...not what Ephraim wanted. He had a dream, an immature one however. He wasn't content in his role. Eirika was far more suited for it. He wanted to be a travelling mercenary, living from fight to fight. He adored combat, his lance piercing the foe, felling the opponent. And when he received a strange letter that entailed doing just that...it did intrigue him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe letter asked him to come to a remote location with his lance, in casual armor. It was easy. Eirika could take over in his stead. It was an attractive offer. He could quietly disappear...but that was a little selfish, wasn\u2019t it? Leaving his sister without a trace, leaving the kingdom without a ruler...Hmm. It was also a very odd offer. While Ephraim's love for violence was a known thing, this was the first time anyone ever reached out to him about it. It was rather suspicious as well. Remote location alone? Ah, but he truly wished to pursue his dream...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Most people would recognize his face, so he decided to lay low and take some back routes to get to this location, located in a quiet village. The people there tended to their own things, hardly noticing Ephraim passing through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEphraim had left a note and the location of the meeting in the case he didn\u2019t return in a timely fashion. It was only the responsible thing to do after all- and it would help if something bad happened to him. He didn\u2019t need to disappear without a trace after all. This was just a meeting- a preliminary to the potential dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe letter had told Ephraim to go to the building on the far end of the town. A large, if not a little ramshackle, house awaited him. A small crop of flowers and other arranged plants decorated a plot of land next to it. Some sort of farmer? Strange. Well, the letter told him just to go on in. Ephraim did as he recalled- entered the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark. The windows were covered with black curtains, or perhaps boarded up. Ephraim took a few steps inside. \u201c...Hello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got clobbered in the back of his head, and the world went black\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke some time later, slowly coming to. Groggily, he looked around. He was still in the same house, though a few candles were lit now, dimly lighting the room. And Ephraim spotted someone in a bent over something corner, shrouded in a cloak. \u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloaked figure looked up immediately, revealing what they were over- an alchemy table. \u201cAh, King of Renais, you awaken! You must forgive me for your...restraints. Something told me you wouldn\u2019t be...cooperative otherwise.\u201d He grasped something from the table, and then moved towards Ephraim like an excited child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell? You let me go you das- Mmf!\u201d Ephraim was silenced as a bottle was jammed in his mouth. It was very unexpected, usually they would threaten him with a weapon, but to straight up shove something in one\u2019s mouth, that was bizarre. Though one thing was clear to Ephraim now- this <i>was</i> a trap, and <i>this was not good</i>. This man had nothing good planned for the young king. The liquid in the bottle rushed into Ephraim\u2019s gullet, grazing his taste buds. It tasted overly sweet yet rotten at the same time, and if it were not being forced into his mouth he would\u2019ve clearly spat it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must apologize for interrupting you, but I just wanted to get it out of the way. Now is a good a time as any to introduce myself- I am Perry Lot Convenient, though I prefer to be called P. Lot Convenient.\u201d He pulled the bottle from Ephraim\u2019s mouth and retreated to the Alchemy table yet again. \u201cDid you enjoy the drink? It\u2019s a nasty serum I made myself. It\u2019s a bit of an acquired taste as well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEphraim spat out what remained of the mad man\u2019s concoction. It really did taste horrible. Though he wasn\u2019t done talking. \u201cYou dastard, what do you plan to do to me?\u201d The cloaked man did not answer, hard at work. \u201cAnswer me- Ugh!\u201d His stomach cramped and churned as the potion was digested. It was painful for a moment, before feeling numb and tingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since your so insistent on learning, I\u2019ll make this simple: Your death. Though I was never one for an uncreative death...I\u2019m going to tell you this much. It\u2019ll take three more of those doses to kill you, and it won\u2019t be instant. That being said, you won\u2019t suffer...until riiiiight at the end.\u201d Perry cackled as he finished talking, and Ephraim was hoping someone had found his note and was coming to help. \u201cAnd thankfully for us both, it\u2019ll be a bit till the next dose is done. So get comfortable while you still can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly gurgled under his armor. It felt...tighter? That wasn't possible. The armor fit perfectly that morning, not tight at all. So if it was tight, did that mean...he was getting bigger? His stomach bubbled and gurgled...He pulled on the restraints, though for a mad man he was pretty good at tying tight knots. As he struggled, watching the man continue his brewing, Ephraim felt tingling spread towards...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Enjoy!]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefinition - A form of competitive full-contact wrestling where a rikishi (wrestler) attempts to force his opponent out of a circular ring (dohyo) or into touching the ground with any other body part other than the soles of his feet (Usually by throwing, shoving, or pushing him down).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, at least... That was what could be defined in Hoshidan society in it's days of yore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, over the decades, the sport had slowly died off throughout the nation, save for a few sprawling cities who hold tradition in high value.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...That is, until recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the events that led to the demise of the dragon, Anankos, peace was finally realized between the kingdoms of Nohr and Hoshido, as well as the reborn kingdom of Valla. And yet, during the quest to rid of the foul beast, love blossomed between the two most unlikely of individuals:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoma, High Prince of Hoshido...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And Camilla, Princess of Nohr. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their differing personalities, the two royals eventually became smitten with one another. And with peace finally obtained, Camilla resigned from being a member of Nohrian royalty, and was welcomed as the newly-crowned King Ryoma's betrothed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, not everyone was...<i>delighted</i>, to have such as bewitching beauty as their beloved Ryoma's bride, which left Camilla wanting to prove to the people of Hoshido that she was worthy in their eyes, hearts, and minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow...as to how this would relate to the centuries-old Hoshidan sport of Sumo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne would thank the former Nohrian Princess for such a resurgence in the sport. Despite her coy and fawning demeanor, those who truly knew Camilla would be aware that once she concentrated on a certain endeavor, she fully commits to it, hell or high water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's what has occurred, as the purple-haired woman was currently tended to by her personal retainers. Though, one wouldn't initially recognize her upon seeing what has become of the once svelte vixen of Nohr, as Camilla's retainers assisted their mistress in getting her purple mawashi properly secured on her now rotund frame, which smooshed a little against her tucked-in mammoth apron of a belly, which was propped up by a set of widened hips and a burgeoning waistline, held aloft by adipose-filled thighs, cankles, and adorable chubby feet, which deceptively hid some surprisingly strong muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once they properly fastened their mistress's mawashi, which was comfortably snug around her equally plump buttocks, the retainers soon refocused onto their lady's upper attire, which could only be described as <i>\"an elegantly large tube-top\"</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please hold up your hair for me, Lady Camilla?\" The retainer politely asked, to which the corpulent purple-haired betrothed of Ryoma nodded in compliance and coyly flirted, \"<b>*sexy giggle*</b> Why of course, my dear!\" And with that, despite the initial blushing from one of her retainers, Camilla complied with the request, calmly holding her voluminous locks of violet purple hair aloft with a pair of rather chubby arms and hands, obviously a side effect from a drastic change in diet to acquire such a humongous physique she now possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Camilla was internally quivering with lustful anticipation, as the retainers fastened her tube-top around her hefty breasts, which had only increased greatly in volume and circumference with each succulent feast. And what warranted such eagerness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the retainers then promptly coordinated to style up their lady's abundant locks into a functional yet eye-catching <i>Chonmage</i>, or topknot (as part of Hoshidan Sumo tradition), Camilla...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With peace already achieved between the kingdoms of Nohr and Hoshido (along with Camilla becoming Ryoma's betrothed), the three women were able to spend more time together, now that there was no longer any brewing conflict for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, both Hinoka and Sakura were quite curious as to what their eldest brother saw within Camilla to make her his bride, so they both voluntarily agreed to see if they can spend some <i>\"Quality Time\"</i> with their new sister-in-law, just to make sure the purple-haired woman wasn't bewitching their beloved Ryoma into marriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, much to their surprise, Camilla was actually much nicer than they initially expected, especially the way that she coddled and fawn over them from time to time throughout their little trip. Eventually, they soon discovered her compassionate motivations to attempt to be fond of in the peoples' hearts and minds, which seemed to make them have a twinge of guilt towards Camilla's plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...That is, until the purple-haired vixen spotted a certain market kiosk that were selling old Sumo memorabilia. Almost on the spot, it sparked an idea in the woman's mind when Hinoka explained a little as to what Sumo actually was. Suffice to say, both Hinoka and Sakura were thoroughly surprised when Camilla then proclaimed to revitalize the sport of Sumo as Queen of Hoshido the very next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, it surprised even Ryoma a little when she then stated that she'll be actively pursuing a career in the sport as well. Though, he was willing to support her endeavors when seeing his betrothed becoming quite committed to becoming a Sumo Rikishi (wrestler).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, just to be on the safe side, he traveled to a nearby monastery to recruit the aid of a sagely master of Sumo, Saguchi Takahona. At first, the middle-aged master turned away the Hoshidan King on several occasions. That is, until Camilla came along with Ryoma on the next visit to the monastery. And for some unexplained reason, Saguchi quickly accepted the offer to train Camilla in the art of Sumo, on the condition that when the time came, she would prove herself in the dohyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast forward to present day, and the day of such a trial had arrived. Camilla soon mentally prepared herself for the coming bout today, psyching herself up somewhat for the initiation. After all, according to the Royal Physician, as of today she now weighed in at almost 600 pounds, with a good portion of said weight being comprised of built-up body muscle in order to perform the feats necessary in a Sumo match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as for her chonmage, the retainers were rather fortunate that their mistress had an exuberant amount of hair to work with, to which they had to improvise a little, since Camilla had enough hair on her head to make two chonmage. So to compensate, the retainers fashioned a good portion of her hair into a proper topknot, with enough leftover hair to then weave into quite a substantial hairbun, despite how wavy their mistress's hair was known to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is done, Lady Camilla.\" The first retainer said, to which Camilla promptly stood up from the reinforced stool she sat upon, where she then calmly waddled over to her full-body mirror for a proper examination of herself. She pulled off a few sexy poses to see how everything fits upon her hefty form, which was holding up quite nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, this excited Camilla just a tad, as the second retainer then appeared before her, holding what appeared to be a traditional Sumo yukata robe in her hands, presenting it to Ryoma's betrothed as if it was an offering and said, \"...Your yukata, Lady Camilla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, my dear. It looks wonderful.\" Camilla fawned, gently grabbing the yukata from the retainer's clutches, to which she unfolded the garment, thus revealing these exquisitely intricate designs upon the silken fabric, akin to a beautiful Hoshidan painting. The rotund purple-haired woman gave a coyote almost gleeful smile at her new garment, to which the two retainers then presumed to don the yukata upon their massive mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes afterwards, Camilla made her way to the newly-built Hoshidan arena, waddling her way through the neatly maintained wooden and mortar tunnels leading out into the open air, escorted by her two retainers, who walked close behind their large lady should anything happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could already hear the echoes of the crowds roaring with cheers and applause from where they stood, which got Camilla just a bit eager to make an impression upon her people. After all, she was responsible for reviving the sport itself, so it was only fair that she'd become one of the sport's newest participants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, she was already aware of who her very first opponent would be, which was none other than...</span></div></div>",

However, Takumi was joined by Camilla's own sister, the youthful and spry Elise, who was dressed up in a fancy kimono, which left little to the imagination as to her overly pampered physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, they watched as a formal announcer walked onto the center of the circular ring, to which the crowd grew silent to heed the announcer's words, as the man threw his voice aloud so everyone can hear him as he exclaimed, \"...Ladies and Gentlemen!! Nobles and Commoners alike!! We are gathered here today, for the rebirth...of SUMO!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if akin to fireworks, everyone save for the Royal Family, roared with cheers and applause, whilst Ryoma and his siblings firmly applauded with several hefty hand claps, to which the announcer ceased their emotional onslaught with a raise of both hands. From there, he spoke up once more and continued, \"However, this illustrious sport was not reborn by Hoshidan hands!! As if fate itself transpired before us all, a foreigner...No! A Princess! Was able to give new life into such a tradition that spans through countless generations!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beloved Sons and Daughters of Hoshido!! Lend us your ears and cheers!! Allow us to present you the one responsible for the rebirth of Sumo... Hailing from the Kingdom of Nohr, lend your applause for Our Highness's betrothed, Lady Camilla!!\" The announcer howled, directing the audience's eyes toward the archway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, silence echoed throughout the arena, but once Camilla slowly stepped into the daylight, a chain reaction occurred with the crowd. One by one, as they witnessed what had become of their new queen, they began to howl in applause and cheer out her name, with Ryoma showing his appraisal the most, a broad smile upon his chiseled face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as if on cue, Hinoka soon began to audibly chant, \"Ca-mil-la! Ca-mil-la! Ca-mil-la!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like a series of dominos, the crowd followed their Princess's example, adding their voices to Hinoka's, cheering, \"CA-MIL-LA!! CA-MIL-LA!! CA-MIL-LA!! CA-MIL-LA!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Camilla felt cathartic yet relieved that her contributions to the sport have been very fruitful, as she then put on a bit of showmanship,  waving at her people with a meaty arm while she made her way into the ring. Once there, she then blew a faux kiss towards her beloved Ryoma, just in time for the announcer to settle down the crowd, to which they willingly comply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And now, her opponent!! Hailing from a long lineage of legends in Sumo, he now returns to the crowds and cheers of the people of Hoshido!! Ladies and Gentlemen, Youth and Elder!! Please, give all your cheers and applause for the Ebony Boulder himself: SAGUCHI TAKAHONA!!\" The announcer roared, as Saguchi entered the arena, as the entire audience instantly roared to life with applause, chanting with enthusiasm as they cheered, \"SA-GU-CHI!! SA-GU-CHI!! SA-GU-CHI!! SA-GU-CHI!! SA-GU-CHI!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Camilla can clearly see that Saguchi clearly had quite a monumental following, as the announcer had to put in some more effort to quell the crowd's applause. From there, Saguchi then took his turn to speak, to which the audience keenly listened, as the legendary champion then said, \"...People of Hoshido!! I am deeply humbled by your cheers and praise!! It feels good to return to the dohyo once more!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However!! I did not just come here for all of you!!\" Saguchi explained, to which he then gestured a hand towards Camilla,  then posthumously continued, \"...For you see, this young lady before us, whom to many of you had doubts, was willing to give new life into what was once a withering custom to our beloved nation!! She even went as far as to take on the mantle of a Sumo, as you can clearly see!! To me and my fellow Rikishi...That is no miniscule task!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on instinct, the crowd roared to life once more from Saguchi's words, to which he calmed the audience with a simple wave of the hand, where he then continued, \"...Even though she is indeed a foreigner by birth, she has proven today that she has the body--\" He then promptly gave Camilla an affirmative pat upon her monumental stomach, then proceeded, \"--And the mind to accept our very way of life!! One that she never truly experienced till these last few weeks!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But today....Today we shall see if her spirit is indeed worthy of Sumo!!\" Saguchi roared, to which the crowd did so as well, as both him and Camilla went over to their respective sides of the circular ring, with Camilla getting a clear view of her beloved and his family from where she stood, as both she and Saguchi got themselves into the traditional Sumo squat position, both feet firmly planted on the ring floor, with Saguchi resting his right fist on the floor, while Camilla had to put both fists upon the floor due to her breasts making her slightly top-heavy, despite putting half of her training into strengthening her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, according to what she had learned about the etiquette of the sport, she had to get into this deep-squat position in order to commence a proper charge against her opponent, as her thoughts centralize on winning this bout as she mentally noted, <i>\"...Okay, Camilla. This is it. Time to prove your worth.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly, her eyes looked up at Ryoma, who leaned forward a little in his seat, obviously a little worried for her sake, to which Camilla found to be somewhat adorable on the stoic samurai's part. <i>\"Don't worry, my dear. I won't lose.\"</i> She thought to herself, as if to reassure Ryoma of his worries, to which the rotund woman then gave Saguchi quite the stern expression, with an upward curve of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the competitors now in position, a referee came up to begin the bout. He moved his fingers, counting down in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a quick downward swipe of a firm hand, the bout had begun, as both Camilla and Saguchi charged into one another at full sprint, instinctively grabbing each other's mawashi to gain a foothold over one another!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The crowd roared with vivid applause and cheers as the two rikishi clashed, with both combatants not budging even once! Meanwhile, back in the Royal Stands, Ryoma leaned forward in his chair, both out of concern and curiosity, while Princess Sakura and the rotund Elise proceeded to cheer for Camilla in moral support, yelling in unison, \"Come on, Camilla! You can do it!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Saguchi was slowly gaining a foothold against the purple-haired woman due to years of well-built experience, as the crowd chanted his name aloud, \"SA-GU-CHI!! SA-GU-CHI!! SA-GU-CHI!!\" However, at the moment, Camilla's thoughts were only focused on the cheers of her <i>\"Family\"</i>, ever so thankful for their support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...Thank you for your cheers, little sisters. Time I own up to what I've been training for!\"</i> She thought, as she suddenly pulled off a daring maneuver! Although Saguchi was an elite veteran of the sport, Camilla stood a good head taller than him, as she suddenly pulled up on the veteran's mawashi, swiftly turning her body around enough to send Saguchi off his feet, letting go of the man's garment in the process!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, this sent Saguchi briefly flying out of the dohyo with one clean counter! Initially, the crowd was simply speechless, as well as Ryoma and the others. But then, as if acting on impulse, Ryoma cheered loudly for Camilla's triumph, which caused a chain reaction from the crowd, as they applauded for the up-and-coming Sumo rikishi! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Camilla gave a grateful bow towards her loyal subjects, then blew another kiss toward her beloved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the announcer came back up onto the ring, raising Camilla's plump arm as he proclaimed, \"First round goes to...Lady Camilla!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd uproared with cheers and applause at the newcomer, which made Camilla all the more content. Meanwhile, Saguchi calmly stood back up for the second round, cracking his neck and stretching his shoulders due to how a little rustic he was, as he mentally noted, <i>\"...She certainly has improved her technique. Impressive. Very impressive, Lady Camilla.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, as the two combatants returned to the center of the ring, they bowed before one another, then proceeded to return to a Sumo squat position as before. The referee returned once more to countdown the beginning of the next bout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with another downward swing of the hand, the second round began, almost as similar as before. This time, Camilla was the one who was gaining ground against sagely Sumo master, using her obvious larger size and height to her advantage! However, Saguchi had much more technique behind his attacks and grapples, which was putting Camilla on the backpedal by only a slight margin.</span></div></div>",

No character death unless you're adapting a scene that has it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Straight and gay pairings are allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Sex is sorta allowed but don't make it non-consensual or have it happen constantly. Everyone is here for the weight gain not for the sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Keep everyone in-character unless their is a (good) reason given for the change in personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. The only fetishes that are allowed are weight gain, its sub-genres, and minor slob behavior (like belching and messiness.) though don't get carried away with the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Weight gain via magic and other sources are allowed but try not to have the characters gain too quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that now onwards!!!</td>",
