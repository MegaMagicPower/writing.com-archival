Are you sure this is a good idea, Sly?\" Penelope asked, discreetly hacking into the security system from her laptop, along with subtly showing her concerns regarding their current heist. Meanwhile, Sly was stretching his legs a little to distract himself whilst the petite mousette was doing her thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Penelope! After all, we wouldn't be pulling a heist if this British ambassador wasn't so shady, now would we?\" Sly retorted, twirling his signature Cooper Clan cane within his fingertips, just to keep his wits as sharp as ever. It came with the territory of being a descendant from a long lineage of master thieves, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he finished with a double-jump backflip, Sly looked back towards the meek mouse, his cane slung against his right shoulder, as he then spoke toward Penelope and quipped, \"...And besides, didn't you say to Bentley earlier that you wanted to get <i>\"out of your comfort zone\"</i>? You know, to contribute more to the gang?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Penelope couldn't help but blush a little, due to her tiny child-like crush on the appealing raccoon thief, along with momentarily thinking back to the adorkable turtle known as Bentley, as she finally tapped into the inner circuitry of the private security system, to which she spoke into her Binocucom and asked, \"Okay, all set to go on our end! Any luck, Bentley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"--Almost got it. There! You now have access to Mr. DeVinci's private collection. Murray and I will meet you back at the van. Good luck, guys!\"</i> Bentley replied over the private comms, finally cracking the encryption algorithms and firewalls that were allocated in Ambassador DeVinci's residential security system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the double doors leading into said private collection room, Sly and Penelope cautiously entered inside the expansive gallery, which was adorned with two dozen works of art encased in glass displays. Originally, if Penelop didn't hack into the security systems with Bentley's assistance, the two would've had to deal with tightly gridded trip lasers allong the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrivial for someone like Sly Cooper, but extremely difficult for someone of Penelope's skill set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they slowly made their way through the rows displayed artifacts, Sly and Penelope soon stopped at their intended prize: A pair of bronze-coated arm bracelets, each adorned with a singular pristine sapphire gem in the center. According to the briefing prior, it is said that these bracelets were blessed by Plutus, the Greek God of abundance, hence the Greek engravings inlaid onto the bracelets' surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. It's actually rather beautiful when you see them up-close.\" Penelope whispered, to which Sly simply replied, \"Yeah. Too bad for DeVinci that he won't be in possession of them for much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Sly placed a gadget specialized in stealthily cutting through class containers, carefully tracing a large enough hole to cut open and grab the bracelets. Thankfully, all the self-practice paid off, as they were soon able to get at the artifacts, with Sly displaying a smug smirk and quipped, \"Too easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is.\" A female voice rang out, as a metallic click could be heard behind the duo. They instinctively raised their hands upon realizing who they were dealing with, where the raccoon thief soon casually chirped, \"Hey, Carmelita.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can it, Ringtail. You're under arrest.\" Carmelita snapped, aiming her Shock Pistol squarely at Sly, to which Penelope attempted the defuse the tension and said, \"Look, Inspector Fox. We're just trying to take these bracelets back from Mr. DeVinci. You should know by now that he's corrupt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm well aware of that! That's why I've been here for almost a month undercover.\" She loudly whispered, switching her aimed line of sight on Penelope, too distracted to notice Sly slowly going for a smoke bomb in his leg pouch, then returning his hand to it's previous position before the feisty vixen was none the wiser, whilst Carmelita continued, \"...That is, of all the criminals in the world, two members of the Cooper Gang just so happened to waltz right into DeVinci's private collection--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quick as the wind, Sly then threw the smoke bomb toward the ground, causing it to detonate in front of Carmelita, temporarily blinding her! However, as Sly and Penelope dove out of the Shock Pistol's line of fire, Carmelita, with her vision hindered by the sudden blast of smoke, fired randomly around her, hoping to hit either Penelope or Sly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that was the least of her problems, as her sporadic shooting inadvertently shattered the glass container holding the bracelets. In turn, as a second shock blast was fired, it hit both bracelets in unison, which, oddly enough, began to glow with a weak ethereal glowing aura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as if in a flash, the bracelets suddenly flung off the display stand, where one clasped itself upon Carmelita's exposed wrist, while the other bracelet zoomed over to Penelope, then magically sealed itself upon the mousette's own wrist! In turn, both women felt a shocking stinging sensation, causing them to collapse onto their knees in sudden pain, clasping their arms in the process! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, as the alarm was about to blare out, Sly instinctively grabbed Penelope, dragged her along by the arm, and jumped out of the opened window in the previous room they used to enter the estate! From, despite the extra load of carrying an in-pain Penelope, Sly sprinted towards the Cooper Van, as Bentley opened the backdoors yelling, \"Quick! Get in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a last bit of desperation, Sly tossed Penelope into the van, just as he dove inside as well, as Bentley closed the backdoors while Murray floored it on the gas pedal. Suffice to say, it wasn't exactly a clean getaway.</span></div></div>",

Grasping her forehead some, Penelope eventually came to notice how she was no longer in her usual ensemble from the night before, save for her golden brown shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...What happened last night?\"</i> She mentally asked, only to then see one half of the pair of artifacts they intended to steal now firmly wrapped around her wrist. In turn, her initial response was that of shock, blinking twice to thrice to make sure she wasn't hallucinating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? How...H-How did this get on me?\" She questioned aloud, putting a hand upon the cusp of the ornate bracelet, performing a few experimental tugs, which only proved how persistent the item was in staying on it's wearer's wrist. Eventually, after a few harder tugs, Penelope ultimately gave up on trying to dislodge the metallic jewelry from her arm, huffing in protest at this disposition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, her attention was turned towards the bedroom door, to where she saw none other than Bentley in the doorway, as he rolled over to her in his wheelchair as he quipped, \"Merciful Hades! Thank goodness you're okay.\" Eventually, he made his way to her side by the bed, still in his wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, he placed a concerned hand upon the mousette's now nude hand, looked at her directly behind his spectacles and calmly asked, \"...H-How are you feeling, Penelope?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Bentley. My ego is a little bruised, but...it'll heal.\" She replied, lightly bumping her rodent snout against Bentley's reptilian nose in a meek form of affection between the two blossoming <i>\"love-nerds\"</i>, as Sly would jokingly refer to them as. In response, an upward curve of his lips appeared as he then said, \"That's...That's really good to hear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I suppose so. But...\" Penelope interjected, to where she showed Bentley how she's unable to strip the bracelet from her wrist in emphasis, then continued, \"...How did this even get on me anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm not completely sure myself, but--\" Bentley elaborated, only to be interrupted by the abrupt yet sudden noise of Penelope's stomach growling up a storm. Of course, it elicit a greatly embarrassed blush upon the mousette's face, her eyes looking away from the handicapped turtle out of sheer embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, both she and Bentley blushed by this unexpected intrusion, to which Penelope attempted to remedy the situation by meekly retorting, \"Wow, I...I-I honestly didn't know I was so hungry.\" \"Yeah, that's...That's strange. Luckily, we were about to sit down and breakfast. I assume you want to join us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Penelope wanted to save face. But on second thought, a subtle suggestion wiggled it's way into her mind, wanting her to take Bentley up on his offer, and so she did by replying, \"Actually, Bentley...I'd love to sit down with you, Sly, and Murray.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Penelope slowly dismounted from the bed, following close behind Bentley, hand-in-hand like two blossoming lovebirds. However, little did the turtle and mousette realize as they exited the bedroom, there was a noticeable tire-sized stain embedded upon the bedsheets. Was it all a mere coincidence? Or...was something far more devious going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>==5 Minutes &amp; 23 Seconds Later==</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShock and awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the only words that could be described by the original three Cooper Gang members as to what was transporting before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly had a slight wide-eyed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBentley had a confused yet quizzical look on his glasses-wearing facial features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Murray...well, he merely watched as he bit into a large grilled cheese sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as to what they were gawking at? A quite ravenous Penelope devouring full platters of food with an air of gluttonous gusto, one that would put even Murray to shame. However, what shocked the trio the most was how Penelope was packing all that food in, considering her petite physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst she was voraciously gulping down a beer mug full of Orange juice, she momentarily ceased her gluttonous assault to look at her compatriots in a confused expression, cocking a mousey eyebrow in response and asked, \"... Do I got something on my face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, they tried to disguise their confused expressions by faking it that they were none the wiser. Though, despite being proficient in their occupations as thieves, they weren't hiding their awkwardness of Penelope's newly emboldened appetite, as the pink-furred mousette was onto them so easily, swallowing a large mouthful of waffle slices, which landed in her now expanded stomach, now sporting an orb-like bulge on her abdomen, and it was still growing little by little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

(What the hell is this!?)\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the very words that the reputable Inspector Carmelita Fox shrieked in her native tongue, especially when it came to a shocking revelation seen before her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of her usual laced blue undergarments, she found only dozens of thick crinkly diapers in place of aforementioned panties, as they were neatly placed in the underwear drawer. However, what surprised her prior to eliciting such a peeved reaction, she had awoken to find herself in equally bulky padding around her private area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, much to her utter embarrassment...the infantile undergarment was actually mildly damp from urine, which all the more warranted the furiously embarrassed blushing on her vulpine cheeks. After all, the last time she ever had to wear such humiliating garments was when she was a little girl still learning how to potty train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...H-How the hell did this even happen?\" She muttered under her own breath, to which her attention soon turned to the bracelet around her wrist. From there, an angry scowl began to form on her face and snout, where she then began to impulsively yank at the bracelet in frustration as she growled, \"You... You did this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to violently wrestle with the bracelet in an attempt to violently dislodge it from her arm, circling around her room a little in the process. However, as if it seemed to possess a will of it's own, the bracelet suddenly crackled with ethereal electricity, the bolts zapping all over the room, as one of the sparks zapped the diaper that Carmelita was wearing, since she was wearing only her skivvies when she discovered her embarrassing conundrum upon waking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, much to her utter frustration, Carmelita soon felt her diaper inflate and puff outwards just an inch or three, exclaiming it's expansion with an audible <b>*Poof-POMF!*</b> in the process. Instinctively, she stopped herself from tampering with her inanimate captor to prevent any further embarrassment, to which the bracelet ceased it's magical discharge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything calmed down, Carmelita attempted to stand up to assess the damage, only to feel the extra cushioning on her womanhood, buttocks, and the space between her legs, thus forcing her leg stance to widen by a small but noticeable amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Excelente. Simplemente genial (Great. Just great). They're thicker now. *frustrated sigh*\" She muttered aloud, obviously not amused by the infantile-themed turn of events, noting how much the now bulkier diaper made her butt look just a tad bit fatter if she was wearing her stretchy blue pants right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Now how am I supposed to do my job with this stupid thing?\" She huffed, poking at the inflated front of her diaper once and twice, clearing becoming irritated by how damp the crinkly undergarment was by now. Much to her begrudging demeanor at this point, Carmelita ultimately admitted defeat, exhaling a defeated sigh in the process as she lightly growled, \"*sigh* Alright, fine! You win. I'll get chssnged into a fresh one. Est\u00fapida pulsera m\u00e1gica ... (Stupid magic bracelet...)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carmelita stripped herself of the wet diaper and grabbed a new one from the drawer, she still had a profusely embarrassed blush upon her cheeks, her thoughts allocating as to what her colleagues would think of her if they saw her in such an embarrassing state, thinking aloud as she muttered, \"...I swear, if Winthorp walks in here right now while I'm doing...<i>this</i>, I'll never hear the end of it...*shudders*\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, there was a small kit for diaper changes, such as baby powder and baby wipes, in the same drawer as the aforementioned diapers, as Carmelita noted how thick the crinkly undergarments as the one she wore prior. Suffice to say, the vulpine Interpol officer had a bad hunch that this won't be the last time she'll be using a diaper anytime soon.</span></div></div>",

This whole situation has gotten...<i>complicated</i>.\" He answered, to which Sly attempted to alleviate the situation as he sarcastically jested, \"...Well, look at it this way; It could probably be a lot worse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* You're probably right, Sly. But...this still doesn't explain how--\" Bentley retorted, only to be cut off mid-sentence by Murray, who rushed in as if it was an emergency.

Her hands unconsciously placed upon her torso in an almost peaceful display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, pal. I don't see anything wrong with--\" Sly loudly whispered, thinking that there initially wasn't anything particularly wrong with the mousette aside from her now bloated overpacked stomach. However, he stopped mid-sentence when he accidentally stepped into something rather...<i>wet</i>, which left a mildly gross feeling in his blue socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" He quipped, lifting his foot off the floor, now seeing his left sock was now soaked.

You mean to say that...Eugh!\" Sly retorted, trying his best not to gag at such a fecal-related revelation. And yet, due to that trained thieving eye of his, the raccoon soon traced the puddle of pee, which ultimately led back to none other than Penelope, who appeared to have a distinctive wet spot upon her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Sly spoke back to his two best friends and hesitantly explained, \"Uh, Bentley... I...I think your girl has bit of a wetting problem.\" Listening to what Sly had to say, Bentley soon took notice of what his raccoon friend said, easily noticing the wet spot on Penelope's underwear, which surprised even him, especially since he was the one who's dating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Oh Penelope... What's happening to you?\" The handicapped turtle muttered, his mind configuring as to what was causing such predicaments in the first place, as the gemstones on the bracelet began to emit a weak ethereal glow to it's sheen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at her residential apartment, Carmelita seemed to be encountering her own set of embarrassing predicaments, which could only be surmised in a single sentence:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you stupid pants! You haven't been this tight before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted, attempting to get her skin-tight blue pants over her now bulky diaper, which proved a more difficult pursuit than she previously expected, as the navy blue garments kept stopping at the point where her diaper and legs coincided, which caused numerous <b>*crinkles*</b>, as well as profuse blushing from the blue-haired vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, after several arduous minutes of persistent attempts at hopping about to get some progress on getting pants on, Carmelita huffed out another frustrated breath, shortly after sitting down upon her living room couch. In anger, she simply took off the now ill-fitting blue pants she's worn on numerous cases, violently tossing them aside in a fit of anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Now I'll have to make up some stupid excuse not to come into headquarters today. *sigh* Chief Inspector Barkley is gonna have my head for this...\" She muttered under her own breath, to which her gaze then looked upon the ornate bracelet firmly attached to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost in an instant, her anger bubbled up to the surface once, glaring a hostile gaze at her inanimate torturer, violently clasping her hand around it and yelled, \"You... This is all your fault!!\" And with a violent hot-tempered swing of her arm, Carmelita slammed her wrist against the couch arm in an impulsive manner, obviously in a futile attempt to let the bracelet know how she's feeling at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once it felt itself being attacked, the bracelet retaliated against it's wearer, but in an unexpected manner, as Carmelita then felt a writhing pain within her stomach. But instead of feeling something akin to being stabbed with a knife or a sharpened blade, the diapered vixen suddenly felt this sudden feeling of nausea, akin to someone not eating for several days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she tried resisting these unfamiliar temptations, trying to hold on to her dignity as a prestigious member of Interpol. Unfortunately for the bluenette vixen, the bracelet wasn't amused by it's host's resistance, so it then began to administer a thirsty migraine to impede her, causing Carmelita to keel over, wrapping her arms around her flat stomach as if she had a virus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long until the enduring prolonged aching took it's toll on her, as her mouth began to salivate with hunger. And in that moment of weakness, the bracelet had won. From there, as if in a panic, Carmelita mindlessly toddled over to her kitchen, then voraciously pulled out numerous foodstuffs, and began to absentmindedly gobble them up with a gluttonous fervor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, little did the possessed Carmelita initially realize at that moment, from this point on, the bracelet would be a hindrance to her in the coming days, as her toned flat stomach soon but slowly began to balloon outwards and widen in preparation for the wearers' encroaching form.</span></div></div>",

Est\u00fapida puerta... (Come on! Stupid doorway...)\" She groaned in her native tongue, forcibly pushing herself free from the restrictive confines of the wooden doorway frame, until Carmelita was able to free herself with a muffled <b>*Plop!*</b>, causing her to land belly-first onto the carpet floor with a slight of embarrassment upon her now chubbier face, though it was more akin to frustrated annoyance than anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly standing up from the floor, a loud set of crinkling noises could be heard, reminding the bluenette vixen of her current plight, as a thick padded diaper could be made out underneath her now skintight blue pants. In her plump hand, she held the current source of her frustrations for the moment:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pink slip envelope, which meant she was on temporary leave from Interpol, due to her current stature and weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer superior, Chief Inspector James Barkley, made it abundantly clear that she was to take a leave of absence until she lost the excess weight. Muttering to herself, she said, \" <i>\"You're not returning until you've lost the weight.\"</i> Bah! You think I haven't tried that already at this point, Barkley?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she undo the holster for her Shock Pistol and set it on the Kitchen Island alongside her badge, Carmelita huffed as she lumbered towards her couch, with the combination of her increased weight and her padded undergarments causing her to now have a waddling gait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, upon sitting her now fattened self upon the furniture, it groaned and creaked some from the excess weight, along with her bulky diaper crinkling up a storm. In response, Carmelita placed her plumped up face into the palms of her chubby hands, both in complete embarrassment and humiliation, as if her current predicament reminded her of a difficult period of her childhood...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! She wasn't going to let this massive drawback in her life affect her emotional state, as she looked back at the bracelet around her fattened arm and wrist, which seemed to grew along with her. Her brow furrowed into a scowl, to which she lowly growled, \"You... This is all your fault, est\u00fapido pedazo de basura (you stupid hunk of junk)!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, she wanted to physically harm the bracelet for her series of misfortunes. However, what stopped her was the inanimate artifact's retaliation to her lashing out, as it has already made her eat enough to feed a family of eight, as well as making her wet herself on numerous occasions. Sure, she was wearing a thick crinkly diaper, but it was one that the bracelet forcibly provided her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, she was left with no other alternative than to scold the enchanted piece of jewelry, hoping it didn't exact it's unamusement upon her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* What am I gonna do?\" She said to herself, her eyes looking down at her bulging belly jutting out before her by a good length with it's girth. A few days prior, she attempted to lose some of the weight through strenuous exercise, only for the bracelet to force her to regain the lost weight by cutting a swath through the local food buffet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, it was a Public Relations nightmare on Interpol's behalf for one of their best officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as she waddled toward the freezer to grab a bucket of ice cream to make her stomach shut up, an idea soon popped into her subconscious, looking at the bracelet and noting how she only had one half of the set, a small hopeful curve appeared on her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as she grabbed an ice cream scooper from the drawer, she waddled back toward the couch, along with fetching her personal laptop, as a plan began to formulate in her mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at the Cooper Gang safehouse, Bentley and Murray were basically flabbergasted by the sight before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*crunch!* *crunch!* *Nom!* *Nom!*</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made such noises came from none other than the newly-crowned <i>\"Heaviest\"</i> member of the Cooper Gang, Penelope. Much to the surprise of the rest of the gang, the once petite mousette was but a memory now compared to this newer Penelope. Once, she was only a few inches taller than Bentley. But now, she clearly towered even Murray by a substantial 13 inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to her drastic change in size, Penelope had to make herself some larger clothes to accommodate for her new rotund form, which she made into a larger pair of overalls, including a buttoned up front flap for the bulky padded diapers she now had to wear due to the wetting incident a few days prior, much to her utter embarrassment upon finding out what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee. I didn't know she could pack in so much.\" Murray loudly whispered to his turtle friend, surprised at how much Penelope was now capable of devouring in one sitting. Bentley on the other hand, wasn't sure what to feel about seeing his girlfriend ballooning to such a size, especially with her now wearing a massive pair of diapers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, such thoughts were soon abruptly interrupted, as Penelope stopped her edible assault on a tray of chicken tenders from McQuack's, looking back at Bentley and Murray with a mouthful of food as she asked, \"...Ish shomething wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh...N-No,  n-nothing's wrong, Penelope. H...H-How are you feeling?\" Bentley stammered, obviously blushing whilst he scratched the back of his bald head somewhat. From there, the rotund Penelope cocked her head a little to the side in mild confusion, until she understood what her diminutive boyfriend was sheepishly asking. Then, she then looked at him with a curious tone and softly retorted...</span></div></div>",

A big one!\" Sly quickly said, attempting to catch his breath in the process, as Bentley looked at his friend and confusingly asked, \"...What's going on, Sly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooper! <b>*pant* *pant*</b> I know... <b>*pant*</b> You're in <b>*pant*</b> there!\" An exasperated voice rang out from behind the door, along with several audible bangs as well. In turn, Bentley and Murray's eyes went wide in shock and surprise, to which the pink hippo bluntly exclaimed, \"IT'S INSPECTOR FOX!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How did she even find us?!\" Penelope questioned, about as surprised as her boyfriend and his friends. Murray quickly got out of his chair to help brace the door alongside Sly, which proved to be even a struggle for <i>\"The Murray\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--I don't know, Penelope! How should I know?!\" Sly retorted, feeling every hefty pound that Carmelita administered upon the safehouse door. From there, as if out of annoyance, Carmelita yelled behind the door and explained, \"Don't play dumb with me, ringtail! I know that your mousey friend is wearing the other bracelet! I found your hideout because she's been ordering un cami\u00f3n lleno de comida (a truckload of food) from the local McQuack's burger joint for the past few days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing what the bluenette vixens said, Sly looked back at Penelope, who now bore a noticeable blush of shame on her chubby rodent face, giving her a glare that said <i>\"We'll discuss this later\"</i>, to which he then diverted his attention back towards their uninvited guest as he queried, \"Oh yeah? And what makes you think I'm gonna let you in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Carmelita exhaled a frustrated huff, then pulled out the pink slip envelope she received prior, and flatly shoved it through the small mail slip in the door as she answered, \"Read it, est\u00fapido (stupid)!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, Penelope bent down (or at least, as much as she could at her current size and weight) and picked up the pink envelope. From there, she opened it to pull out it's contents, and after a short read of what was written, Penelope looked back at her compatriots and explained, \"Guys...This is a pink slip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pink slip? Then that means--\" Bentley replied, upon realizing what that meant for their unwanted guest, as Carmelita then reluctantly confessed, \"--My bosses laid me off. If I wanted to arrest you and your friends, Cooper, I would've brought backup. However, you saw what's become of me, Ringtail, because of this stupid bracelet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence stirred throughout the safehouse, as they could easily tell how desperate Carmelita almost sounded,  with Sly being the first to acknowledge this revelation, followed by Penelope, then Murray, and finally Bentley. After all, Sly had a thing for Carmelita for some time now, that much was certain, as the ringtailed thief was the first to break the silence and said, \"<b>*sigh*</b>...Okay, Carmelita. We're opening the door. Just...don't shoot us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Sly and Murray slowly unlatched the door's built-in barricades, to where Sly then slowly opened the door for the ashamed bluenette vixens, to which she was currently wearing...</span></div></div>",
