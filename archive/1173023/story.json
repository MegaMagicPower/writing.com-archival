            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jon sighed and adjusted his tie for the hundredth time that night. He could of taken the job at McDonalds, but no. He had to be suckered in by the help wanted ad looking for someone to greet and show customers to their tables. He should have been alerted that something was wrong, when he read the description of the restaurant in the ad. He should have been tipped off that something was amiss when the restaurant described itself as, \u2018a refined caf\u00e9, offering other worldly customers the most unique meal of their lives\u2019. But Jon had just shrugged it off and taken the job without any idea of the \u2018other worldly customers\u2019 or \u2018unique meal\u2019 that they offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon looked around him at the customers and shuddered. It was so weird seeing animated and fictional characters sitting down and eating other characters, and it was only made weirder by the choices each person was making for their meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust last night, Speedracer had walked through the door and ordered the Gilmore girls for lunch. Seeing the badly animated character, gorge himself on the screaming TV characters made Jon feel very unnerved. It was even worse inside the private booths. Once he had checked one of the booths when he heard screaming. Screaming wasn\u2019t uncommon in the Caf\u00e9 because most meals did a lot of crying while they were being eaten and digested. What stood out about the scream was that Jon recognized it as one of the customers. Without think, he opened the private booth and looked in. What he saw Snow White, Cinderella and Alice doing to a shrunken Inu-yasha would haunt him till the day he died. Who would of thought that Disney girls could be so wild? He would never again be able to watch a Disney movie the same way again. In the private booths, most meals ended up inside the customers, just sometimes not through the mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing that had Jon bugged was that the hungry patrons never questioned why they were at the caf\u00e9 or why they were so eager to eat other living-breathing people. Jon got to the entrance of the caf\u00e9 by walking down a long alley a few blocks from his home, but he has overheard customers say the route to the caf\u00e9 was different. Some said they found the entrance in the forest, others in the middle of the desert. It was never consistent with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut perhaps the most distressing thing about Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9 for Jon was that no one seemed to remember the caf\u00e9 twice. People that he\u2019d spoken to previous times would come in and have no idea who he was. He hadn\u2019t been working at there long, but he expected to be remembered once. The most damning evidence that no one remembered the caf\u00e9 twice, was that he\u2019d seen people he served before, be served as a meal while screaming with no idea where they were. It seemed most likely that whenever someone left the restaurant via the door or digestion, they lost all memory of the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon straitened up when he saw two customers get up and head for his way. He put on his phoniest smile and spoke his rehearsed line. \u201cCome back anytime to the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9. Where we serve you in more ways as one.\u201d The two customers laughed and left the caf\u00e9. Idly, Jon wondered if the next time he saw them, would they be the ones being served up as meals?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a nice couple. They even offered a tip, but I turned them down. We don\u2019t charge customers any money, so why should they tip me.\u201d Jon turned and gave a real smile to the only sane person he\u2019d met since starting this job. Never mind that the person was really a bunny girl, who carried people out of the kitchen to be eaten alive, all the while smiling brightly. Her name was Bunny and she was the server to every customer that walked in through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call them a nice couple. That was Lust and Gluttony from the anime series Fullmetal Alchemist, they are evil real pieces of work.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunny stared at Jon blankly and he sighed at seeing the confused look on her face. Like the characters that walked in through the door, Bunny had no idea that they were from fictional series. He\u2019d tried to explain it to the anthro-bunny, but she had just smiled blankly and said she understood, but of coarse, she didn\u2019t. Jon had given up trying to explain, figuring that Bunny wasn\u2019t capable of understanding the strangeness of their customers or their job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever Jon,\u201d Bunny responded with her big toothy grin. \u201cI think table three is ready to order so I better get over there. By the way, I think you have a customer waiting behind you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon nodded dully and watched the beautiful bunny girl strut over to table three. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, working up his resolve to turn around and face another bizarre character that should technically not exist. He put on his phony smile and turned to the customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9, the only place where everyone\u2019s on the menu. I\u2019m Jon and I\u2019ll be showing you to your seats.\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jon blinked several times at the young pubescent boy that had walked into the caf\u00e9. He looked fairly normal, save for the whisker like marks on his cheeks and unusual clothes. Honestly, wearing bright orange, did this kid have any fashion sense? His blond hair waved around as he looked up and down the restaurant. Confused about where he was and how he got there. One thing he did know though, he was hungry and for once, Naruto didn\u2019t think Ramen would cut it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mister,\u201d Naruto spoke up, grabbing Jon\u2019s attention. \u201cAny chance I could get a table? I feel like I could eat someone as big as Choji.\u201d Naruto didn\u2019t notice that he had just referred to another person as a meal, which wasn\u2019t too much of a surprise. Once someone entered the caf\u00e9, the concept that eating another person was wrong went out the window. People were food and no matter how much they cried and pleaded, nothing changed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly, follow me to your table,\u201d Jon said respectfully and led Naruto through the restaurant to an empty table.  Naruto took his seat and Jon handed him his menu. With his job done, Jon left, giving Naruto an opportunity to look over his menu with a ravenous eye. Naruto had never felt anything like desire before; he left that up to his sensei Jiraiya. But at that moment, Naruto desired every single person he saw on the menu. From the prettiest girl, to the handsomest man, none weren\u2019t craved by the young ninja. He wanted them all, but not in the conventional sense. He wanted to taste them, feel them fill up his belly, and then digest their beautiful bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt exultant and the only thing putting him down was the fact that he could only have so many before he was full. If he could, Naruto wished he had the endless hunger of Choji, so he could eat all the gorgeous people in front of him. But he wasn\u2019t Choji and he couldn\u2019t eat every single person on the menu, therefore Naruto had to only select the very best to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready to order,\u201d The sweet voice broke Naruto\u2019s concentration and he looked up at the smiling face of the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9\u2019s only waitress, Bunny. She was eagerly waiting to take his order and bring the blond boy his first serving of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll have him,\u201d Naruto said quickly, pointing to a boy in a military uniform. Then he thought about it again and quickly decided on another person. \u201cI mean her!\u201d Naruto cried, now pointing to a redheaded pigtailed girl wearing a Chinese shirt. Then another picture caught his eye. \u201cMaybe her,\u201d Naruto said, not with so much certainty. He was pointing to a woman in purple tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the trouble the customer was having, Bunny made a helpful suggestion. \u201cWhy not close your eyes and randomly point to someone.\u201d<br>\r\nNaruto nodded his head slowly, it was the best solution. If he didn\u2019t get a meal soon, he was going to gobble up the waitress and then who would bring him seconds? Closing his eyes and taking a deep breath, Naruto randomly pointed at the menu selecting who he was going to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Nami\u2019 from One Piece,\u201d Bunny read out from the menu. The orange haired pirate girl was pictured on the menu, smiling brightly and carrying a long pole. She had long legs and an ample bosom, not something Naruto usually noticed but those things would be in his belly, so he cared this time. Pausing to think, Naruto struggled to decide if he wanted Nami as his meal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cBring her to me, I\u2019m starved!\u201d Naruto said, no longer caring who he ate. All that mattered to him was getting someone inside him as quickly as possible. Bunny nodded and rushed to the kitchen, not bothering to even ask if Naruto wanted Nami shrunken or taken to a private room. She had a hungry patron to feed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was left at the table, holding his stomach and thinking hard about his meal. He knew that morally it had to be wrong to eat someone alive, but right now, he could care less. His hunger needed to be sated and he\u2019d deal with the moral ramifications later. Besides, he was a ninja, killing people was what he did. So what if this person would be dyeing inside of him instead of with a blade in their necks. A death was a death, no matter how you did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, out of the kitchen came Bunny. Balancing a huge covered plate on one hand, she walked over to Naruto, who looked like he was going to explode. His meal had come and he could barely contain his excitement. Soon he\u2019d be dining on a delicious girl, he could hardly wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plate was placed on his table and the cover was removed. Naruto stared strait into scared and confused eyes of Nami. She wore a white shirt, with blue strips all over and a tiny orange mini-skirt that barely covered her long legs. She was kneeling on the plate, unsure of how she\u2019d ended up on the platter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey kid, where am I?\u201d Nami asked, looking at Naruto curiously. The kid looked like he was ready to go ballistic. His eyes were wild a bit of drool was running down his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you were you\u2019re going, into my belly,\u201d Naruto chuckled.<br>\r\nNami looked at Naruto like he was crazy. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to eat you up good,\u201d Naruto simply said and lounged at the unsuspecting pirate. Nami didn\u2019t even have time to flinch, with Naruto training in speed and his maddening hunger, he had grabbed Nami around the waist. Naruto pulled the girl closer and opened his mouth wide. Nami gasped as his gapping maw stretched out to impossible proportions. Realizing she was in trouble, Nami tried to think of a way out of her current predicament.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Nami begged, trying to come up with a way to get her away from the hungry ninja. She needed to think fast, or she was going to end up being eaten by an overly spirited ninja boy. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHow about I pay you?\u201d Nami said and smiled nervously. Naruto took no notice of Nami\u2019s final words; he had grown too hungry and needed to have the orange haired beauty inside him to satisfy his craving. Naruto opened his mouth and began feeding. His lips slide down across her hair, descending slowly over her forehead as he pushed down. Her ears bent down against his lips and then snapped back into place inside his mouth when he pushed Nami a little further in. Naruto\u2019s lower lip was against her eyebrows for only a moment, and Naruto's lips passed her eyes and ears, leaving her blind. Nami involuntarily closed her eyes as the sound around her was immediately muffled by the wet sounds inside Naruto's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami\u2019s last cry of help was cut off when Naruto pushed the rest of her head into his mouth. Naruto's lips wrapped around Nami\u2019s neck like a collar, holding tightly as Naruto sucked more of Nami in.  Paused for a moment to prepare him for his first swallow, Naruto took a few deep breaths before swallowing. Nami felt her whole body trembling as she felt Naruto adjust his grip around her waist, and slide his lips around her shoulders. His teeth barely grazed her as he slid Nami between his gapping jaws. Nami had been trying to grab anything to stop her drop into Naruto, but this stopped as Naruto took Nami further in, pinning both her arms to her sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami felt his lips glide across her nipples, pushing down her large breasts as they slid into his maw. Her head was now halfway down Naruto's throat and she felt his throat muscles constricting and relaxing around her. The contractions of his esophagus pulled her gently but firmly inward. Naruto was now halfway down Nami\u2019s body and he felt like he was in heaven. She tasted so sweet he thought he could cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lips were now around her waist and he slid his hands down her legs and took a firm grip of them. He needed a little extra push to get her hips through his mouth, so he roughly shoved the girl in. Nami yelped as her buttocks graved Naruto\u2019s sharp canines before joining her in Naruto\u2019s wide mouth. From this point, completing the swallowing process was easy for Naruto. Moment by moment, more of Nami entered him. Her thighs passed into his mouth and then his lips were around her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly below Nami\u2019s knees did she not feel the warm, wet pressure of Naruto's throat and mouth all around her. Only her calves and feet were not in the warm grip of Naruto's body. The rest of Nami\u2019s legs glided into Naruto's mouth. Now Naruto didn\u2019t even have to push anymore. The swallowing movements of his throat muscles were doing all the work pulling her inside with ease. His lips were around her ankles now. Her sandaled feet hung from his lips, were they twitched as the girl connected to them was covered by the insides of another person. Naruto idly removed the sandals and put them down on the ground beside him. They would make good mementoes of his meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a light slurp, they were inside his jaws and he closed his mouth. He closed his eyes and concentrated, relaxing his throat and swallowing deeply, he felt his whole meal empty into his stomach, which bloated out as more of Nami filled it. His shirt was pushed up by his huge stomach, which shuddered as the person inside it kicked and punched the walls around her in a hapless attempt to escape. Naruto chuckled at the wasted attempts to escape. He sighed and patted his belly, feeling the movements slowly fade as the person inside fell unconscious. Looking towards the menu, Naruto took a moment to decide whether he could really stomach another meal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The empty seats and tables in a 50 foot radius behind him wasnt so lucky... and yet the fellow customers simply turned their heads as if it was nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jon was questioning in his mind why exactly no one else actually cared that they were almost split in half, he listening to hard heavy breathing about a couple inches away from his face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to his to see angry yellow eyes staring into his soul! \"WHOA!\" Jon jumped back and got a good look of his next potential customer. A bruised and battered man with yellowish eyes, long white hair with cute little dog-ears sticking out the top, wearing a big red Gi clothes with parachute pants meaning that he's either of the Far East... or a big MC Hammer fan!<br>\r\nHey, that's Inuyasha... wait, aint he dead? I mean those Disney girls did things to him that would even make Jeffery Dahmer wanna puke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you-\"<br>\r\n\"DONT ASK!!\" the angry dog-boy roared at Jon! Chances are it might not have been an easy escape, what with the scars across his body, cuts across his face, fingernails sticking out his back, blood leaking out his mouth, and a couple of hairs falling off his head. Whatever happened to him, must have been 'A Whole New World'... of Hurt!<br>\r\nAlthough Inuyasha didnt say anything, Jon knew what was on his mind. And that was revenge. But revenge on who?! He couldnt kill Jon, it's not HIS fault! He only greets the customers... kill the bunny-girl! SHE took the order!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the dog-boy showed sudden interest in this place. He looked on the menu and seen various names all across at exceptionally low prices.<br>\r\n\"Wait a second... I heard things about this place. Is it true that ANYONE can be on the menu?\" he asked Jon.<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Jon nodded, \"Anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone, eh??\" Inuyasha raised his eyebrow in intrigue as a devious smirk appeared on his face. Fearing the worst, Jon corrected himself, \"OH! Uh... that is... anyone... except for employees! They are off limits because... you know, they serve the food!\"<br>\r\nActually, that's not true! NO ONE is off limits. Not even the mysterious Management... but godforbid whoever has the balls to order him/her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Inuyasha allready had his lunch planned out in his head. \"In that case.. I want every damn Disney girl you got in this damn caf\u00e9! And I want 'em all shrunk, so I can do EXACTLY what they did to me!\" then he lowered his head and whispered, \"except for a few certain things...\"<br>\r\nJon gritted his teeth when he heard that! Oh man, of all the things the hungry half-demon would wanna eat..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. sorry man!\" Jon shivered a little as he explained, \"But just last night we had a special 'all you can eat' on Disney girls. And apparently, some white-haired freak with a moon on his forehead ate the last one we had.. I think his name is Sessho-\" he immediately stopped in mid-sentence because he remembered the certain relationship between the two customers, \"-Jerry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha groaned in disappointment, \"Ughh.. so there's NONE left?\" Jon thought for a bit... maybe, JUST maybe the caf\u00e9 mightve held out on one or two just in case of emergencies! Like THIS one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think we might have one left in the back somewhere. I'll have to check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it quick!\" dog-boy demanded.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jon scampered away from Inu-yasha. He kept looking back at the half-demon, afraid that he was going to get up and blow him in half. Usually violent customers never make it into the restaurant, something to do with the positive juju vibes management put in. Well, whatever was keeping the violent customers out wasn\u2019t working tonight. Jon looked behind him one more time, thus causing him to miss Bunny walking in front of him carrying a huge tray. He hit the bunny girl from behind and fell back onto his behind. Bunny remained upright and even managed to not drop the jumbo tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Jon, where\u2019d you come from?\u201d Bunny chirped, acting like she had just noticed him. Her tray shook and Jon heard swearing underneath from the very unhappy meal that was about to be served. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBunny, we got a very hungry customer that will cut off my ear if I don\u2019t bring him a shrunken Disney girl, please tell me we have one left.\u201d Bunny tapped her chin and thought about it. Jon was on his hands and knees, beginning for a good answer from the dim waitress. He looked at Inu-yasha and saw he was sharpening up his butter knife with the tessaiga, turning the once dull blade into a weapon made for laceration.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it!\u201d Bunny cried out. Jon lit up like a Christmas tree; his furry angle had pulled him through. \u201cThat ear cutting thing was a reference to the movie \u2018Reservoir Dogs\u2019, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Jon screamed, unable to comprehend what Bunny was talking about. \u201cBunny have you gone crazy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrazy, like the guy from \u2018Fight Club\u2019, who had multiple personalities?\u201d Bunny giggled girlishly. Jon was sweating bullets now, he could hear the sound of teeth mashing together from Inu-yasha. He needed to get one of those animated girls or he was going to have a six-foot blade scratch his prostate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Bunny, you got to help me, you\u2019re my only hope!\u201d Jon latched to her leg and started crying his eyes out. At the same time that he was weeping like a girl, Jon was slowly crawling behind the furry waitress, if Inu-yasha attacked, he could use her as a human/bunny shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this one! I know it!\u201d Bunny hyperventilated and waved her hand around like an overexcited child. \u201cPrincess Leia from the first 'Star Wars' movie said that. Did I get it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I say yes, will you help me keep from being ripped in two by Cujo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunny nodded quickly and Jon said, \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYippee!\u201d Bunny exclaimed and started jumping up and down. The top of the platter she was carrying fell over and Jon saw the meal/person that Bunny had been carrying. Hog-tied and naked was the reincarnation of Kikyo, the junior high girl with the miko powers and the furry enthusiast, Kagome. Jon\u2019s eyes shot open and he fought down a scream. If Inu-yasha saw the girl he was crushing on in this position, he was a dead man. Turning around, and half expecting to see Inu-yasha coming towards him with his giant sword, Jon saw that Inu-yasha\u2019s attention was focused on brooding. He hadn\u2019t seen Kagome, yet. Sighing with relief, Jon turned back to Bunny and handed her the fallen top to the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoever ordered this, make sure they take her to a private booth, away from\u2026\u201d Jon checked over his shoulder again, \u201c\u2026prying eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRightieo Jon,\u201d Bunny did with a mock salute. \u201cThanks again for getting me that DVD player and all those movies for Christmas from Best Buy. I\u2019m finally able to understand all those pop culture references you use.\u201d Jon\u2019s right eye started to twitch. Next year, he\u2019s getting her a coupon for Macys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, here\u2019s the last Disney girl. She was ordered by this guy named Tsume, but you can have her if you really want.\u201d Bunny reached into her pocket and took out a tiny human girl. The shrunken girl was tossed into the air towards Jon, her hands and legs flailing around as she flew through the air. Jon caught her and stared down at the tiny human being. He recognized which Disney girl he was looking at immediately.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

About an hour, ago Sabrina the teenage witch ordered our last member, Urkal. On the bright side, she said he tasted stringy. You probably wouldn\u2019t have liked him.\u201d Jon looked at his feet, dejected about being unable to get his favorite star his favorite meal. Maybe he could find something on the menu that the martial artist would enjoy just as much? Jon thumbed through the menu, trying to find someone that would satisfy the Power Ranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean?\u201d Jon suggested quickly, pointing to the scraggily face of the world\u2019s greatest pirate.<br>\r\n\u201cToo salty, all that sea air ruins the taste,\u201d Tommy groaned. He had been really hopping to have his desired meal and it really bummed him out that they were all out. How could he get into his Zord unless he got his favorite meal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Motoko from Love Hina? She\u2019ll fill you up and her fighting spirit might rub off on you.\u201d Tommy shook his head; he wasn\u2019t in the mood for Japanese. He needed some good old fashion American star to eat or he wouldn\u2019t be able to work properly. Jon sighed, he couldn\u2019t think of anyone else that Tommy could eat, he\u2019d suggested his favorites, but all of them had been turned down. He was about to suggest that maybe Tommy should come back later when they may have some new Family Matter characters on the menu, when Bunny walked up to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving trouble ordering?\u201d the friendly waitress smiled and got simultaneous nods from Tommy and Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell do I have a surprise for you. We just got a new dish in and she\u2019s a dozy. She hasn\u2019t been put on the menu yet, but I\u2019ll let you order her because I can tell you\u2019re really hungry.\u201d Tommy looked at Bunny interested, he hadn\u2019t been able to find anyone he wanted on the menu, but maybe this new dish was what he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d Tommy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer name is Kelly Bundy from Married with Children and when I told her she was going to be eaten, she got really excited.\u201d Tommy nodded, intrigued by this new meal they were offering. Jon on the other hand was flabbergasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelly Bundy?! The Kelly Bundy?! Damn, I used to watch her all the time on the TV in my room, with the door locked, while in bed, and with some lotion and tissues.\u201d Bunny and Tommy looked at Jon for a second, both with mutual looks of curiosity. Jon grew flustered and tried to make himself small, he should of left out that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, she sure is pretty and smart too.\u201d Jon rolled his eyes at Bunny\u2019s comment. The bunny waitress was slow on the uptake. She was the only person Jon knew that could say they once had a pet rock die because they forgot to feed it. Jon forgot about the dumb comment and looked at Tommy. Would he order Kelly and if so, was their any chance Jon could get her autograph before she was digested?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jon shakes his head as Urd comes up to him.<br>\r\n     \"Hey, there, Jon\" said Urd.  <br>\r\n     \"Hello\" said Jon.  \"how did you know my name?\"<br>\r\n      Urd giggled and pointed at Jon's nametag on his uniform.  \"Oh\" said Jon.<br>\r\n       \"I've heard lots of things about this cafe\" said Urd.  \"is it true that ANYBODY could be on the menu?\" <br>\r\n        Jon nods his head, unable to stop himself from staring at Urd's ample breasts.  Urd notices this and smiles.  Urd is wearing her long black and purple dress from the TV Series, that shows off her ample bust. Jon seems to be hyptonized by the sight of Urd's figure.  Urd liked to seduce mortals to have sex with them...but she was looking for a meal now.  Maybe she'll have sex AND a meal.  That thought made her giggle.<br>\r\n          \"What?\" asked Jon, finally snapping out of his trance.<br>\r\n         \"I asked if it was  true that anybody could be on the menu in this cafe?\" asked Urd.<br>\r\n          \"Yes\" said Jon.  \"you can  choose from a variety of choices.  You can eat anybody from another anime or any TV Show, or any movie.

He was never asked to be a meal for anybody in the cafe before.   He wasn't sure if it was allowed because he worked at the cafe.  Jon was almost tempted to say yes on the spot...despite the danger of being digested.  Besides, being eaten by such a lovely woman wouldn't be that horrible.  Jon could've asked Bunny if he was on the menu, but she was busy handing out meals to the customers.  <br>\r\n         \"Well...yes\" said Jon.  Urd smiled.<br>\r\n         \"Then I'll have you.....and a helping of Keiichi Morisato\"   <br>\r\n           \"You have the option of shrinking your meals\" said Jon.  \"would you like one of your meals to be shrunk?\"    Urd takes her time in answering this question. <br>\r\n         </span></div></div>",

No pun intended!\" She giggles to herself.<br>\r\nJon writes up the order. \"Very well. Your order will be ready in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the slightly terrified yet slightly intrigued greeter heads into the kitchen. He starts to think about his fate... he'll soon be eaten alive in the restaurant he's been working at for only a few weeks. To die at such a young age! He wont live to fulfill most of his life goals like graduate from college, get married, have children, cheat on his wife by nailing the bunny waitress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, if he had to choose a way to die.. than what a way to go! Being fed to a hottie-hot-hottay like Urd might not be such a sad ending! Heck, sacrificing his life to feed a goddess might get him into Heaven! And being shrunken down, at least the pain of digestion wont take as long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Jon heads down a long flight of stairs leading underneath the restaurant and into a humongous chamber full of holding cells... the prisoners inside are the food! Jon walks past hundreds of cell doors as he looks through a list of prisoners, \"Let's see... Keiichi...Keiichi... AH! Here! #13064.\" He steps toward Cell #13064, pulls out the key, and unlocks it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he is... Keiichi Morisato. Black hair, brown eyes, 5'3, laying on his bed not taking his eyes off the ceiling. Not very happy about his predicament, Id say...<br>\r\nNevertheless, Jon approaches him, \"Um.. allright, Mr. Morisato. Come with me to the shrinking room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is the end,\" Keiichi sighs still staring at the ceiling, \"At the age of 21 being served as food in a restaurant for cannibals . Will never even live to accomplish most of my life goals like graduate from college, get married, have a family, cheat on my wife by nailing the bunny waitress...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon tries to cheer him up at least the slightest bit, \"Well... if you makes you feel any better, the customer wanted ME too.\"<br>\r\n\"...Oh?\" those words caused Keiichi to stop staring at the ceiling and look toward Jon, \"And out of curiosity, who's this customer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon just grinned a bit when he answered his question, \"...URD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust hearing that name caused Keiichi to jump out of his bed and drop his jaw out of suprised shock! Although it's unclear whether it's a good suprised shock or a bad suprised shock!<br>\r\n\"..NO...FREAKING...WAY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Jon nodded his head and smile, \"So ya ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the expressions on Keiichi's face werent being clear on whether or not he wants to do this! Hearing Urd's name deffinitely got his attention... but is this attention of intrigue... or reluct?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all comes clear when he answers Jon's question:</span></div></div>",

She's so hot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Yeah, I know\" said Jon, gesturing to Keiichi to take his place in front of the shrinking device.  \"Maybe if we're lucky, she'll play with us before she eats us\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Suddenly, Bunny entered the shrinking room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Jon?\" asked Bunny.  \"you were asked to be a meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yep\" said Jon.  \"by that beautiful goddess, Urd\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Ah, yes\" said Bunny.  \"well, I guess I need to find a new greeter then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        You and Keiichi stand in front of the shrinking device, and Bunny activates the device.  In less than a minute, the ground rushes up to you and Keiichi as you two are shrunk down to about 3 inches tall.  Then, Bunny picks you two up and places you on a plate.  Bunny exits the shrinking room with the two of you on the plate, and in no time the plate is placed in front of Urd at a table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Urd smiles down at Jon and Keiichi.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Well, boys\" said Urd.  \"You two are about to find out what's heaven like\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jon and Keiichi stared up at Urd\u2019s giant face with awe. She truly looked like a Goddess to the two shrunken men. As they stared at her, she stared at them. Scrutinizing their tiny bodies and wondering how many calories each would be. Urd knew that she could eat a hundred tiny men and never have her waist grow an inch, but it was still amusing to wonder how much these mortals lives would affect her perfect body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou boys look like little meatballs,\u201d Urd muttered in a husky voice. Hovering over them and knowing that they were soon going to be a part of her, made Urd feel very feminine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t plan on eating us like meatballs, I\u2019ll accept that as a complement,\u201d Jon said half jokingly, trying to hide her anxiety. This was really going to happen, he was going to be eaten alive and digestedby one of the customers. He stood still and waited for Urd\u2019s hand to pick him up from the plate and send him to his final journey. When he saw her reach down towards him, Jon closed his eyes and awaited her embrace. He felt something pass by him, but nothing else. He cracked an eye open to see Urd holding Keiichi in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what about me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush you,\u201d Urd said, not taking her eyes off Keiichi. \u201cI\u2019ve known Keiichi longer, so he goes first. Trust me, you aren\u2019t leaving this table unless your inside me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Jon said sternly. Somehow, hearing that he wasn\u2019t going to be leaving alive comforted him. Maybe it was the beauty of Urd hypnotizing him or maybe he just had a death wish. Whatever it was, Jon wanted to be eaten by Urd and no one else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Urd lifted her hand up to her waiting lips and in one smooth movement, tipping her hand forward sending Keiichi tumbled towards her mouth. Keiichi was flung forward, passing over her boulder like teeth and landing on her soft, wet tongue. Urd felt the featherlike sensation of her meal landing on her tongue and slowly closed her mouth trapping Keiichi in darkness. Jon watched from Urd\u2019s plate as she pushed the tiny man around her mouth. He heard her let out soft moans at her meals taste and close her eyes several times to savior Keiichi\u2019s taste. He knew that Keiichi was being overpowered by Urd\u2019s tongue like he was a grape in her mouth. Being covered in her transparent saliva as he was moistened for his trip down her throat. Urd had the power to make a human being disappear forever. One swift swallow and when she opened her mouth it would be empty. Just thinking about it excited Jon, he could only wonder what the experience was like for Urd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Urd ether grew bored with her foreplay or remembered that she was hungry. Whatever the reason, the conclusion was the same, time to swallow. Everything inside Urd\u2019s mouth was a blur for Keiichi. All he remembered was falling in and then being thrown around a suckled. He couldn\u2019t tell where in the mouth he was or even which direction was the throat. He did however feel the front of Urd\u2019s tongue pushed up toward the roof of her mouth as the back dropped in one smooth ripple that forced Keiichi back towards the throat. Keiichi looked behind his shoulder and saw Urd\u2019s gullet opening and taking him in whole. Slippery soft tissue closed around him, squeezing him downwards towards the stomach. The narrow flesh immediately opened and he was tumbling down a trembling, squishy slope, landing with a splash in a lake of juices boiling inside Urd\u2019s belly. He wadded in the water, already feeling everything go dim as digestion started to set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the stomach, Urd rubbed her stomach and licked her lips. That had been one of the greatest meals that she has had in a long time. She then remembered that her meal wasn\u2019t over and she looked at her plate where her second course was watching on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready for your turn?\u201d Urd asked sultrily. If one mortal was good, another was going to be great. Jon looked up, with an unreadable expression on his face. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wanted to join Keiichi on his way to heaven and he couldn't wait.  Jon runs off the plate and goes towards Urd.  Urd laughs and picks Jon up and holds him in front of her face.  Urd looks at Jon...Jon looks at Urd.  Jon smiled and Urd winked at him, and tossed him into her mouth.  <br>\r\n       Jon landed on Urd's gigantic tongue and Urd began to play with Jon, sending him all over her mouth and covering him with salvia.  After a minute or two of this, Urd's tongue started to force Jon back towards her gullet, and she swallowed Jon alive.  He fell through Urd's large gullet until he was forced through a ring of muscle and fell down, down and down to the boiling acid, ready to digest him.  Urd's stomach was dark and slimy, and had very stale air.  Jon felt the acid start to digest him, and he waddled in the acid to reach Keiichi...but he didn't make it fall.  <br>\r\n       Outside, Urd rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n       \"Keiichi, you were delicious...and so were you, Mr. Masters\" said Urd.  \"I hope you like it in Heaven. Maybe I'll visit you two up there someday\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          -------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Hey Jon!  Get up!\"<br>\r\n      Jon opened his eyes and found himself next to Keiichi.  The two were in what looked like an office...but the office was so huge, that the desk within it was at least the size of a small planet!  Jon looked around in confusion.<br>\r\n      \"Huh?\" asked Jon.  \"where are we?\"<br>\r\n       \"Can't you tell?\" asked Keiichi. \"we're in heaven\"<br>\r\n      \"Since when heaven looked like an office?\" asks Jon getting up from the floor.<br>\r\n      \"Since we took charge\" said a booming feminie voice.  Jon looked up and saw the biggest woman he ever saw!  The woman was sitting behind a desk and looking at the two in front of her.  That's when Jon realized that the 'floor' was actually the desktop!  The woman was beautiful beyond words.  She had blond hair, rosy cheeks and the biggest pair of breasts that Jon ever saw.  The woman was looking through a book.  <br>\r\n        \"Keiichi Moristo and Jon Masters\" said the woman, finding the names in her book.  \"you two were eaten by the Goddess Urd...what a way to go, gentlemen,if I might add.....ah, yes...she was at that cafe I keep hearing about.  Maybe I'll go there one day and have myself a tasty mortal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Who're you?\" asked Jon.   \"And where's St. Peter?\"<br>\r\n       \"St. Peter isn't here in anime heaven\" said the woman.  <br>\r\n        \"Anime heaven?!\" Jon and Keiichi asked.<br>\r\n         \"Yes\" said the woman, smiling.  \"when anime characters die, they come to anime heaven...and when you humans die, you get to meet St. Peter\"<br>\r\n         \"Err...so why am I here?\" asked Jon.<br>\r\n         \"Paper work got mixed up\" said the woman.  \"since you were eaten by an anime character, you got sent here.  Happens a lot since that cafe opened.  You're the lucky few humans that gets admitted to anime heaven\"<br>\r\n            \"And  women run anime heaven?\" asked Keiichi.<br>\r\n            \"Oh yes\" said the woman.  \"got a problem with that shorty?\"<br>\r\n           \"Not really\" said Keiichi, looking sheepish.<br>\r\n           \"Why are we so small?\" asks Jon.<br>\r\n          \"Because that's the way we like it here\" said the woman.  \"the men are tiny and become playthings for the goddesses that live here\"<br>\r\n          \"Goddesses?\" asked Jon.<br>\r\n          \"Yeah, you know, a female god\" said the woman.  \"anyway, I have to check and see if you're going to anime heaven or anime hell first\"<br>\r\n       \"Anime hell?!\" you and Keiichi yell.<br>\r\n        The woman just smiled.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jon sat down beside Keiichi as they waited to be judged. The giant receptionist for anime heaven was on the phone talking to \u2018God\u2019. Jon could hear the scratchy voice of the anime God coming from the phone and Jon couldn\u2019t be sure, but he\u2019d bet he\u2019d heard that voice before, which wouldn\u2019t surprise him. Since starting work at the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9, he\u2019d seen some funny customers, and if one of them had been the anime God, then he wouldn\u2019t be shocked at all. It was so weird knowing that some mysterious female God of anime was deciding their destinies. Although, now that Jon thought about it only a cruel female God would allow so much fan service that gives guys a look at huge boobs and crotch shots, but never let you see the good underneath. Truly, any God that would hide such glory behind flimsy clothes was one to be feared and abhorred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have any idea why we\u2019re going to either anime hell or heaven?\u201d Keiichi asked, still unaware that he was only a Japanese cartoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeats me,\u201d Jon grunts. He lacked both the energy and interest in explaining to Keiichi about his origins. If he told the simple man that he was created to be the poor sap in an anime, where he\u2019s surrounded by beautiful women but never gets any. Jon figured that if ignorance was bliss, he shouldn\u2019t enlighten his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa, got it. I\u2019ll make sure to send the next anime character to you so you can use him as a guinea pig. No, I won\u2019t have my way with them before you. Okay, bye-bye.\u201d The heavenly receptionist puts down the phone and Jon and Keiichi look up at her with restlessness. Surely you both weren\u2019t going to hell, Jon thought. He know from the anime that Keiichi was a nice guy and unless masturbating to anime characters was a sin, Jon wasn\u2019t heading to hell either. The giantess put on a big smile and glanced down at the two recently departed mortals that were waiting for judgment. \u201cI got great news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to anime heaven!\u201d Jon and Keiichi both shouted and started hugging one another. They had been worried they were both going to anime hell, but it looked like that wasn\u2019t going to happen. Oh happy day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, you\u2019re both going to hell for being virgins. I don\u2019t understand it myself, but her mighty Godness thinks that unless a man has some experience in the sack, he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to go to heaven.\u201d Jon and Keiichi let go, gaping at the giantess in shock and horror. This couldn\u2019t be happening, it just couldn\u2019t be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the good news,\u201d Jon said in a daze, vaguely remembering the giantess saying something about good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just saved a bundle on car insurance,\u201d the giantess chuckled. \u201cNow bye-bye. Say hi to Hitler and the guys that edited Escaflowne.\u201d With a sweep of her hand, both of the recently deceased were flung off her desk. With a final scream, Jon plummeted into a world of flames. <br>\r\n\u201cNOOOOOOOO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&amp; #62;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&amp; #62;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Grunt, snort\u2019 Jon grumble as he fell forward. With a thud, he tumbled onto the carpeted floor at the entrance to the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9. He crawled to his knees and rubbed the back of his head. He must have fallen asleep on the job. With any luck, no one had noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a nice nap, Jon?\u201d Bunny asked, hopping towards him with a big sunny smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I think I might of even had a dream,\u201d Jon sighed and straitened his tie. How embarrassing, falling asleep standing up at work. It was alright that Bunny saw him, she was too na\u00efve to be any concern, but if someone notable had seen, Jon would of simply died from embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you dream? I once had this dream where I was naked and this hairy men came out, and they had cherries and whip cream and ravioli\u2026\u201d Jon shuddered and forced himself to ignore the rest of what Bunny was saying, it was too disturbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026don\u2019t remember. Something about clouds I think,\u201d Jon muttered. It was a complete blank for him, strange. He didn\u2019t have much more time to dwell on it because a new customer walked into the Caf\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9, the only place where everyone\u2019s on the menu.

Urd was a goddess after all!  She was supposed to see all and know all and other cool goddess-type stuff.  Like any other character that comes into this cafe, they forget that they had ever been here.  Jon wondered why this was so, and what could possibly wipe out the memory of a goddess?  <br>\r\n       \"Anybody can be on the menu, except me\" said Jon dryly.<br>\r\n         Urd looks Jon up and down.  \"You're too skinny for me, anyway.  I want a nice filling meal\"<br>\r\n        Even Urd's taste of food had changed.  Jon shakes his head, and wanted to know what the hell was going on.  Could this be hell after all?  No, no....this couldn't be hell...Hitler wasn't there,nor were the little assholes that ruined Escaflowne on American TV, forcing you to buy the DVDs just so you could....<br>\r\n        Urd was looking over the menu, thinking of what (or rather who) to have.   <br>\r\n       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt; &gt;&lt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Keiichi found himself in a cage.

So why was he here? \"Excuse me for asking Keiichi, but how exactly did you find this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I came here because of a bet with a sexy friend of mine. She was talking about this Cafe and I didn't believe her. So she told me about it and we made a bet about it being real. I guess she was right.\" Keiichi told Jon. \"Enough about me, I like these three for my first meal. Shrunken though; i'm not sure I could eat a person whole.\" Keiichi showed Jon his menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jon smiled wickedly as he saw the three women he choose for his first meal here. \"You don't need to worry, once your in here you can eat a person normal sized or not.\" Jon assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Really?\" Keiichi said as he thought it over. \"Nah, i'd rather eat them small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Right away sir.\" Jon said bowing as he headed towards Bunny to tell her of his order. \"Bunny, I have a order for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Bunny was walking out of the back room, carrying what appeared to be a mini-Sakura, Naruto, and Sasuke. Looking at him, she smiled \"Sure thing. That guy Kakashi can wait till I get this persons order. So what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, Keiichi at table 12 wants...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWow, a Goddess platter. He\u2019s one hungry little guy isn\u2019t he?\u201d Bunny giggled as Jon nodded slowly. He couldn\u2019t believe that he was the only one that remembered that Urd ate him and Keiichi. It seemed like it only happened a few hours ago, but of that was true, how could Urd of ended up on the menu? How could he have died, fell to hell and woken up in the restaurant. A disturbing thought occurred to Jon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBunny, are we in hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Jon sighed and shook his head, what was he thinking? If this was hell, he\u2019d be surrounded by fat, ugly people that wanted to eat him, not the most beautiful men and women from every media imaginable. He probably just imagined it all in his head. Too much work and not enough play. Jon gave himself a mental reminder to ask for a day off to get his head on strait. He could come into work with a screw loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid he ask for a private booth?\u201d Bunny asked. Private booths were closed off rooms, where the customer could do things with their meals that were better not done in public. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask,\u201d Jon muttered a little bit uncomfortable. It was Bunny\u2019s job to get the orders, but he\u2019d broken the rules so he could talk with Keiichi. He was just supposed to greet the customers and take them to their tables, not take orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019ll have to ask him when I bring his meal.\u201d Just then, one of the blond shrunken meals tried to leap off the plate, but before he could make it off, Bunny batted him back on to the plate with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBad shrunken man, very bad,\u201d Bunny admonished the shrunken boy in a patronizing tone. \u201cYou be nice or I\u2019m deep frying you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, Bunny, could you get the platter of Goddesses for me? I can see you\u2019re busy, so I\u2019ll deliver it myself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Thanks. I\u2019ll go get them.\u201d Then, Bunny was off and Jon was left alone with his thoughts. Had he really just died a little while ago? The more he thought about it the more he was uncertain. It seemed like something likely to happen at the restaurant, but not to him. Maybe it was better to just chalk it up to overwork and forget it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere ya go, Jon!\u201d Turning to Bunny, Jon looked down at three tiny women lying naked on an open plate. He\u2019d forgotten that when meals were shrunken, often their clothes wouldn\u2019t shrink with them. The sight of the hot naked forms of the three heavenly females, made Jon\u2019s mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter take them to the customer fast or else it looks like you\u2019ll eat them.\u201d Jon blushed, he hadn\u2019t realized that his excitement was so noticeable. Bunny giggled one more time at his embarrassing antics and left to take the copy-ninja his three-student lunch. Jon took one more look at the Goddesses, nearly blowing a gasket when Urd opened her legs and exposed herself fully to him. Forcing his eyes off the Goddesses, Jon rushed to Keiichi\u2019s table. When the young man caught sight of Jon and what he was carrying his eyes lit up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou brought them,\u201d he beamed. He\u2019d spent the time since he ordered imagining his three tiny Goddess meal. He wanted so badly to taste them it was practically maddening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I brought them,\u201d Jon grumbled and put the plate down, but not before catching one more look at Urd. \u201cBy the way, we offer private booths where you can eat in private and do things to your meals besides just eating them. You can eat them in there, but also so much more. So you want to check it out?\u201d Jon tried to speak casually, but it was hard when you were telling someone they could molest a bunch of tiny women if they pleased. Keiichi thought about it and responded quickly.  <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wanted to go to a private booth and do Heaven-knows-what to the three tiny goddesses?  That wasn't like Keiichi at all...not from the anime.  You've seen that anime and always thought that Keiichi was dumb not to bang at least one of the three beautiful goddesses that came to live with him.   If you were in Keiichi's shoes, you would've banged Urd the moment she came out of the TV.   You shake your head to clear it, and lead Keiichi to a private booth.<br>\r\n       The private booths were in separate rooms where the customers would have privacy for whatever they did with the meals-to-be.  You and Keiichi walked past the Dark Magician Girl, who was gobbling down what looked like the entire cast of Chicago Hope.  Seeing people from all types of media eating other people is nothing to you now, but when you started to work here it gave you a shock.  You've seen Mai Valentine eat Faye Valentine, seen VERY buxom anime babes eat a whole plate of shrunken men.  You've seen a lot of amazing stuff at this cafe...and yet, you haven't seen the Manager of the place.  The Manager is always in his or her office all the time...you don't even know if the manager is human or some other race from a form of media.   Bunny doesn't even know what or who the manager is....and she doesn't ask questions.  You wonder if you'll ever get to meet the manager. <br>\r\n         You and Keiichi go inside a private booth, with you carrying the plate of the three shrunken goddesses.  <br>\r\n          \"Here you go\" said Jon, placing the plate onto the table and seeing Urd spread her tiny legs again, showing you her pussy.  You  blush and turn away. <br>\r\n           \"Please enjoy your...meal\" you say.<br>\r\n            \"Would you like to join me?\" asked Keiichi.

Jon looked down at the three sisters as he thought about it. 'Sure their cute, but wouldn't it be awkward if I ate them after having some fun in front of Keiichi?' Jon thought. Looking up to the goddesses hungry master, he shudder at the perverted and evil look that Keiichi was giving this small women. Just the thought of being in the same booth as him would be disturbing beyond belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking up at Keiichi, Jon shaked his head \"Sorry Keiichi, but i'm against eating others. But if they wanted to eat ME on the other hand.\" Jon told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keiichi frowned for a few seconds, but simply shrugged off your reply and smiled \"Okay then Jon. It's your lost!\" He said with a smile that sent chills down Jon's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jon slowly walked backwards as he looked at Keiichi, getting more disturbed by how he was acting with each second. \"Okay then. See ya!\" And with that he was off, running as far as he could to the other end of the Cafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keiichi watched as Jon left and simply shrugged \"Weirdo.\" Keiichi said as he turned his attention to the three goddesses. All of them smiling as they looked up at him. \"Well girls, its just you and me!\" And so he entered the booth, preparing to play with his sexy little snacks.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The private booths were designed to be spacious enough to fit up to five people, but also give them plenty of room to move around. Keiichi whistled in appreciation for the swank set up the restaurant had for their private booths. Satin love seats were placed around a large round, table that was covered by pink mattress that Keiichi could lie down on if he really wanted to lie down. He steeped fully into the room and looked at everything with awe and amazement. He had this whole room to himself, to play with the three girls he had lived with, but never dreamed of touching. He could do anything he wanted in here and the first thing he wanted to do was take off his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiichi placed his plate of mini-goddesses on the table/futon and started to undo his belt buckle. As he was changing, Urd, Belldandy and Skuld slowly started to wake up. They all gowned and crawled to their feet, feeling a slight headache that made them feel dizzy. Urd was the first one to fully regain her senses and she looked across from her to her two sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid we go to one of Thor\u2019s parties?\u201d Urd asked weakly, still feeling shaky from whatever knocked her out.  Urd\u2019s first question was based on a very little known fact that Thor hosted some wild parties. Urd often went, but occasionally she was able to convince her sisters to come and when the three of them went, things always went insane. Ending up naked, with no idea where they are is tame compared to some of the other crazy things they\u2019ve done at Thor\u2019s parties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Urd. Skuld\u2019s head isn\u2019t shaved and my rump doesn\u2019t feel sore.\u201d Urd nodded to Belldandy\u2019s observations. Now that she thought about it, she didn\u2019t have the smell of alcohol on her breath, which she always had after a party. So if they hadn\u2019t been partying, what was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not even going to ask what you girls were talking about,\u201d boomed a voice high above the trio of goddesses. The three looked up, tilting their heads high and having to step back to fully see the figure in front of them. Looking like one of the powerful gods they often hanged out with and sporting wood, was the mortal they had known for a very long time, Keiichi Morisato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, either the fumes from Urd\u2019s potions have finally rotten through my brain or Keiichi has become a giant with very little modesty.\u201d Keiichi chuckled softly at Skuld\u2019s words. He didn\u2019t know if she was kidding or serious, but he knew that he was going to show the miniature goddess that her mind wasn\u2019t at fault for what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you girls are ready for fun,\u201d Keiichi said, taking his seat to better look at his naked feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m always ready for fun, but usually I do it when I\u2019m bigger then my lovers thumb.\u201d Urd was mildly amused with her current situation. She didn\u2019t know the circumstances for how she got here, but did it really matter? Urd lived to have fun and maybe this current experience could be interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say, something about tiny girls really turns me on.\u201d Keiichi liked his lips, looking intently at the tiny naked body parts of his three goddesses. The things he could do to them made him quiver. \u201cAren\u2019t you excited Urd?\u201d Keiichi asked, watching the tiny features of Urd\u2019s beautiful face. Looking for any sign of enjoyment or displeasure.        <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Heck, I may like being the towering giantess, but when I am around a giant as cute as you who wouldn't want to be played with and eaten!?\" Urd rubbed her breasts together, getting her nipples nice and hard. Urd sat down and released her breasts. She brought a finger down to her nether regions and started to rub her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's what I like about you Urd. Always the horny one.\" Keiichi smiled as he brought a finger down to her body and began to slowly rub it. Urd let out moans of pleasure as he rubbed her breasts and pussy, getting it nice and wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Belldandy and Skuld would have been shocked by their sisters actions, and of what Keiichi was doing were they not looking a the towering giant that stood before them with shocked and horny expressions. Both of them were overcome with desire at being used by this giant at any moment. \"Oh! Don't forget about us Lord Keiichi!\" Belldandy shouted to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Keiichi looked down and at the other two sisters and smiled wickedly. He loved being called Lord by the goddess \"Of course. That is, should you all call me Lord Keiichi from now on!\" Keiichi said with a big boom. The three goddesses purred as he commanded them with such power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, Lord Keiichi!\" The three goddesses said simultaneously as they bowed(except for Urd and you should know why). Keiichi's cock grew harder as they referred to him as Lord and even master.</span></div></div>",

My little horny doll looks like she\u2019s going to explode,\u201d Keiichi observe, seeing Urd continue to play with herself. The two remaining sisters stared at their eldest sibling. Her wanton cries grew louder as she slid another finger into herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour right, my lord,\u201d Belldandy said, then looked back up at the man she only wanted to serve with adoring eyes. \u201cPlease give my sister your full attention. She needs you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Keiichi humbly replied. The girl\u2019s submissive attitude was turning this meal into such a lusty affair. He lowered his head down to Urd and stared closely at her tanned, nude body. Her fingers plunged into her hungry slit, coming out glistening with her juices. Seeing Keiichi so big and so assertive had sent the lusty goddess into a frenzy. How many centuries has it been for her since the last time she was really turned on? Urd had seen every kind of man and fucked them all, but this giant was new and the thought of fucking a new man made her so randy. Slowly, Keiichi picked her up off the table, not disturbing her masturbation and laid her in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrd stop!\u201d He commanded and the goddess immediately complied. Breathing deeply, Urd laid on her side, one arm covering her breasts and one hand cupped over her vagina. Keiichi brought his finger down to Urd and traced his fingers over her tiny breasts, giving one a light pinch which caused Urd to let out a soft moan. Her breasts were the size of grapes, so tiny, so soft. He could feel the tiny nub of her nipple on the tip of his finger. While two fingers rubbed her breasts, his index finger traced down over her stomach and between her legs. His fingertip nudged delicately at her pussy lips, pushing her open slightly. Keiichi pushed his finger in, getting the whole tip inside. He wiggled his finger inside Urd, making her moan and thrash around on his embedded finger. He pulled out, leaving her gasping for more. Keiichi chuckled softy and wiggled the finger he\u2019d used to impale her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to beg, I got plenty more for you.\u201d This time, Keiichi lifted her up to his face. Urd at once thought that he was going to eat her and the only regret she had was that she never got to experience more with the giant man. Keiichi opened his mouth so, as Urd thought, to push her in, but instead of her going in, his tongue came out. The wet, slippery snake reached out towards Urd, touching her cheek before moving down her body. His tongue probed her, sliding back and forth over her breasts then down over her stomach. Urd hugged the slippery muscle. She was amazed by both the tongues heat and strength. She let go and it ran down her stomach towards its intended target. The tip worked it's way into her pussy, going further and pushing Urd wider then Keiichi\u2019s finger. Keiichi thrust his tongue in and out, going as far as reach Urd\u2019s cervix before pulling out. It didn\u2019t take long for Urd to be brought to an earth shattering orgasm. Her fingers gripped the sides of the wet beast and her head tilted back as she screamed. Her juices poured onto the invading tongue. Keiichi pulled out, giving the tiny orifice a kiss. He placed Urd back on the table with her sisters, who looked up at him in amazement. Both wondered, who would be next to serve their beloved lord. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A big man almost 7 feet tall in a thick black cloak in hood. His face was covered by a tribal mask possibly used during Indian Firedances resembling the head of a red coyote. All that was seen underneith were a pair of golden eyes...<br>\r\n\"You have slept in the middle of your shift, Mr. Masters!\" the 'coyote' said in a thick gruff voice, \"The Great One is very disappointed in you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were being very careless, Jonathan!\" said a strict and lenient female voice coming from another black cloak and hood the same size as the Coyote, but wearing a mask resembling a black pointy-eared Egyptian Jackal.

Im sorry about that, Jackal and Coyote. I didnt mean to offend our bo-uh, our leige.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal and Coyote. Jon Master's supervisors. They are absolutely loyal to the Management who is practically a God to them. Despite being 'old-fashioned', Jon quickly got used to them after a while of listening to their preaching of their boss. Unfortunately, Jon never even seen this 'Management' since he first started working. And even when he applied for the job, it was Coyote and Jackal that interviewed him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed impossible to answer their questions, like 'What makes you worthy of serving the Allmighty Employer?' and 'In how many ways can you show your appreciation toward the Lord of Managing?' The only reason he got hired in the first place is probably because Jackal has a thing for him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen well, Mr. Masters,\" Coyote stares into Jon's soul with those golden eyes of his, \"A well-known aristocrat of nobility is planning to dine inside this Caf\u00e9 tonight.\"<br>\r\n\"Your task, Jonathan,\" Jackal looks down at him as well, \"is to service to the noble's whim. Whatever this person wants is what they shall get. Do it successfully and Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9 will prove to be a great success, influencing the Powers that Be to produce chains of restaurants globally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon's mission: To make Le Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9 a monumental hit. All it requires is kissing some rich ass. Doing this could mean a HUGE bonus in the pay-bucket! \"I wont let any of you down, sir! Ma'am!\" he put his hand to his head and saluted his supervisors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoyote simply nods, \"See to it that you do not. Otherwise, our Highness will deal with you... PERSONALLY!\"<br>\r\nJon let out a heavy sigh. He knows Coyote aint kidding. He also knows that the Caf\u00e9 went through about 8 greeters in one month before hiring him. Although the whereabouts of these former greeters are still unknown, all that's suspect is the eeriely generous \"No Firing\" policy..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the masked supervisors started walking away, Jackal turned her head back to Jon showing even the slightest bit of concern in her eyes before finally speaking, \"..........Good luck, Jonathan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust hearing those words caused Jon to smile a bit. As he marched back towards the door to greet the next customer, he secretly wondered to himself, what does Jackal even look like under her mask? Is she 'manimalish' like the waitress, Bunny?

Jon at first thought he was dealing with a na\u00efve child, entering the restaurant looking for her first meal. Most customers were of the older variety, so it seemed logical that the girl was new. Then, Jon noticed two things that made his first assumption seem unlikely. The girls emerald eyes held in them a spark of intelligence and seemed too old to belong on a child. Also, her hair was shaped like a crab and what type of teen would do that to their hair? Jon finally figured out the customer\u2019s identity when she looked up at him with a crocked grin and placed her hands on her hips. He\u2019d seen this look before in one of his animes, it was all coming together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, miss Washu,\u201d Jon said politely with a bow.  Was grinned broadly and let out a loud cackle that made Jon\u2019s ears sting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems my reputation precedes me, but I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, after all, I am the universes greatest mind of all time,\u201d Washu proudly proclaimed, letting out another shrill bout of laughter. Jon winced at the high-pitched laughter and tried to usher Washu to a table. If he could get her seated, then he could escape from her annoying laugh. Washu followed slowly, she\u2019d stop every few steps to look at some of the meals that other people were having. She took a particular interest in a small cat-girl gorging herself on a much bigger werewolf. Washu watched with scientific curiosity as the cat-girls stomach ballooned out more and more until it was bigger then her whole body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon had to grab Washu\u2019s hand and drag her away from the cat-girl. Washu pouted at being taken away, but then reminded herself that she could be the one with the huge belly and promptly forgot about watching the cat-girl eat. She was led to her table and took her seat. Jon reached over to give Washu her menu and she happily took it. Jon turned to leave, but he was stopped when he felt someone grab his hand.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind having someone join me to give my belly a massage after I fill it with victims.\u201d Jon turned to Washu to tell her off. He was dedicated to his job and he couldn\u2019t abandon it whenever he wanted to. However, he forgot all about his conviction, when he turned to Washu, not finding a young lady, but a much more mature, sexier woman. Washu had shifted to her older form, but had done so without changing her clothes, causing the undersized garments to rip, exposing a lot of soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you keep me company, I promise not to eat you,\u201d Washu said with a sexy pout. Bending over slightly, she added to the pressure by exposing her cleavage to Jon\u2019s hungry eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhhhh\u2026\u201d Jon whimpered, forgetting most of the English language when confronted by all this skin. He was able to work the part of his brain intended for speech after a second and responded to Washu.      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She likes to flirt with Tenchi mostly, just to piss off her daughter Ryoko and Princess Ayeka.   Jon knew that Washu could change into her sexier adult self, but seeing it in real life.   In her adult form, Washu looked to be in her mid-20's, and had a much bigger bust.  <br>\r\n      <br>\r\n        \"Well, if you don't eat me, I'll be happy to join you\" said Jon to Washu's offer, which made the genius smile.   Washu then turned her attention to the menu and scanned it.  Jon sat in the chair next to the sexy red-head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Jon had never been invited to rub the belly of someone who had a bellyfull of victims before.  He had wanted to, of course, but didn't dare do it because he might end up in a stomach...or be fired becasue of sexual harassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"So..\" said Jon.  \"this is your first time here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh yes\" said Washu.  \"I just saw this place and wanted to fill my belly with lots of people.

The awkward feeling in the air made it hard for Jon to think of anything to say to the scantily clad scientist. What do you say to someone that you\u2019ve joined for a dinner that consisted of Pokemon trainers, alchemists and ninja turtles? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Washu,\u201d Jon said, and then stopped talking, that was all he could think to say. He couldn\u2019t talk about him or she could be tipped off that he knew her from Tenchi Muyo. So, that left the only her personal life to talk about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you must like guys because you only ordered males from the menu,\u201d Jon said with a chuckle, rubbing his head uneasily as he tried to think of some conversation. Washu\u2019s grin broadened and she leaned closer to Jon to whisper something in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe truth is, I don\u2019t really care about the gender of my meal. Don\u2019t tell anyone, but I\u2019m not partial to having just one gender inside me. I\u2019ll do anyone, male, female or even a little bit of both. I love being filled, either by a handsome boy or a sexy girl. I just love feeling flesh against mine, nothing is better then being intimate with another person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose the only thing you won\u2019t eat are animals. I guess you draw the lines at bestiality?\u201d  Jon joked, trying to lighten the mood. He didn\u2019t miss the double innuendoes that Washu was using. He tried not to think of what Washu was insinuating, but he couldn\u2019t keep out the images of Washu being  \u2018intimate\u2019 with some guy or girl. Washu noticed that she was making Jon nervous. She grinned and went in for the kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf coarse I draw the line at animals, but since I meet so many aliens, it\u2019s hard to tell which are animals or sentient beings. I\u2019ve got to tell you, I\u2019ve been with my share of furry, four-legged aliens, with things hanging out the size of your arm.\u201d Jon was nearly to the point of fainting now. God, this was so embarrassing. He was saved from another  racy fact about Washu thanks to the sudden arrival of Bunny with a huge tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m having some trouble getting all your meals on the plate so I\u2019ll give you the first half now and come back with the rest when your finished. Is that alright, ma\u2019am?\u201d Bunny said with a pout. Some of the meals were putting up a huge fight and she couldn\u2019t get them all on the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, just give me what you got. I\u2019m so hungry, I could eat a horse.\u201d Jon sulked and held his face in his hands, struggling not to think of what that would look like. He looked up in time to see Bunny lift the top of the plate up.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ed looked over his shoulder and spotted Jon, sitting silently across from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind helping me?\u201d Ed said rudely. Jon ignored the young alchemist because he knew what fate awaited the boy.

The boy frowned at her and she just smiled back, sizing him up and calculating how much his small body would stretch her out. She was still smiling when her hands shot out towards the huge plate on the table. Ed expected the hands to grab him, but instead they passed by and took a hold of Ash and Gary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJon, I got my hands full holding these two.

Furthermore, Jon was a bit curious to see how many people Washu could pack away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen up Washu,\u201d Jon said, make an effort to get into his role of feeder. Washu grinned broadly and then opened her mouth wide, exposing the pink interior and the dark hole at the end of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know people call me small, but there is no way I\u2019m fitting in there,\u201d Ed said, pointing at Washu\u2019s tiny mouth. Jon couldn\u2019t help but chuckle softly at the boys lack of knowledge about vore. It was time for him to learn how elastic the customers of the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9 can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon stood up and walked to Washu\u2019s side of the table. Taking hold of Ed\u2019s foot, Jon dragged the boy to Washu\u2019s waiting mouth, which was starting to drip saliva down her chin. Carefully, Jon put Ed\u2019s toes into Washu\u2019s mouth and pushed his foot in until his toes hit the back of her throat. Taking a deep breathe through her nose, Washu gulped and pulled Ed half a foot across the table. She had swallowed Ed\u2019s leg up to his knee with one gulp. Her warm, slimy throat enclosed over Ed\u2019s one leg tightly. Ed could feel his leg be held in the warm vice, but could hardly believe what was happening. There were so many reasons why this should be impossible he didn\u2019t know where to start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashu\u2019s throat pulsed around his trapped leg, loosening before tightening and pulling him further into her body. His leg slid into the slimy throat, warm pressure all around, bringing the reality of his situation to life.  Washu stretched her jaws further apart to take in the small remainder of Ed\u2019s left leg. She contracted her throat and moved her head around, causing her maw to wriggle over his hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCut it out!\u201d Ed shrieked, reaching down to stop Washu\u2019s descent over his whole body. However, before he could lay a hand on Washu, Jon\u2019s arm shot out and grabbed his hand and forced it to Ed\u2019s side. Washu looked up at Jon in gratitude and took another strong swallow, sucking him into her throat up to his navel. Washu also managed to snag his hand, leaving Ed without any means to escape. Ed clenched his fist and tried to move his arm, but it was being held too tightly against his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Ed was helpless and that Washu could finish him off by herself, Jon returned to his seat to watch the beautiful woman dine n the helpless alchemist. Jon marveled at the sight of Washu, her throat and chest bulging with the shape of half of Ed\u2019s body. He could see the shape of where his stump was as well as his one arm being held in the throat. Jon knew that all those bulges would just create one big protuberance in Washu\u2019s gut, giving her the large belly she so much desired. Jon looked forward to seeing her that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashu swallowed again, feeling her prey drawn deeper into her throat. Her mouth moved steady up his chest, over his nipples and finally slipping over both shoulders. Her lips came together around his head and for a final time, she looked down her nose at his terrified face. Washu opened her mouth a little bit and let her throat work around him. Washu watched his head slip between her lips, disappearing into her maw for a last time. She sucked his ponytail into her mouth a let out a loud, wet gulp. Her esophagus contracted down tight around Ed and gave him a firm shove downward. The small form slid effortlessly down Washu\u2019s windpipe pushing the wriggling meal down to her stomach. Ed was pushed into the slimy stomach to curl up and wait for digestion, while on the outside; Washu\u2019s belly ballooned out four feet. Washu looked at her belly nodding in approval, then she looked at the two frightened boys that she was still holding onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich do you think should be next, Jon?\u201d Washu asked leaving her next meal up to her helper. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had seen almost every episode of pokemon there was, and Jon's decision was a easy one; Gary.  Gary was mean to Ash and picked on him every chance he had in the series...now it was time for Gary to meet his fate inside Washu's stomach.  Jon pointed to Gary, which made Ash smile.  It seemed like Ash was glad to be last to be eaten.  Gary and Ed didn't want to be eaten, but it seemed like Ash did.  Who  wouldn't want to be eaten by a sexy woman like Washu?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n    \"Uhh...Jon?\" asked Washu. \"mind helping me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Oh, right\"  said Jon.  He grabbed Gary and lowered him feet first into Washu's awaiting mouth.  Washu swallowed Gary's legs at once, holding them in place.  Meanwhile, you have a hold onto Gary's arms to stop him from escaping.  Washu swallowed Gary, bringing his crotch inside her mouth...then, she played with Gary's cock with her tongue.  Soon after, Washu swallowed him up to Gary's chest, where his two arms were down her throat.  Jon stood and watched as Gary was slowly slurped up by Washu, sending him to her belly to be digested.     Outside, Washu's belly had grown from 4 feet to 8 feet.  It was bigger than the rest of her, and Jon wondered what she would look like with the reminder of her meal within  her.  The thought made Jon smile.  He wanted to see how many people Washu could pack away.  Over the months he had worked at the cafe, Jon had witnessed characters stuffing themsleves to impossible girths.   One prime example was with Lina Inverse from the anime 'Slayers' who had eaten 10 people in one sitting...Lina's belly had almost took up the entire cafe!  <br>\r\n         \"Yummy\" said Washu.  \"And now, for Ash's turn\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jon felt a twinge of nervous fear for his manly nerves and his body from becoming part of the menu as he looked at the ravishing wild card carrying beauty that had locked her golden, yellow cat like eyes on Tenchi since she first met him, though it seems she had her heart set on another body of meat tonight. Ryoko approached Jon with her trademark, crystal blue spiky \"hedgehog\" style hair flashing vibrantly near her long ears, yellow eyes, and that twinkling fang that slightly edged out of her inviting lips. Her legs were encased in rose red leggings complete with light blue colored spots on her feet, hands wore gloves of the same red color. Jon could feel his cheeks blush nervously at sight of Ryoko's half exposed breasts from her low cut, red and white blouse. Her shoulder and arm sleeves each a different color, her left one was black and her right one was bronze gold. Jon found himself paralyzed with fear of being eaten by Ryoko's ravenous lips, or maybe just her breathless beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner help, may I you Ryoko miss?\" Jon said nervously, he felt sweat dripping from his eyebrows as his cheeks went red as a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoko wickedly chuckled \"Now isn't that typical, drooling over a pretty young woman like myself. So typical of you men, at least you have good taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon sighed as he felt better, seemed Ryoko wasn't interested in a meal after all, or was she? Suddenly Ryoko's red gloved hands yanked on Jon's tie, the one he kept fumbling to get on every time he came to work. Ryoko nearly yanked Jon's flushing face to ber bountiful bosoms as she flashed a most peculiar yet menacing glare at the frightened clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT Tenchi is the only man for me in my life, so why don't you keep your eyes off the goods and bring me some food, and some sake while your at it. That crazy Washuu gave me a body that can never get fat or gain weight, I intend to use it and I don't want to be kept waiting because your horny hormones are distracted by me\" Ryoko snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yy-y-y-y-yes ma'am, I m-m-m-mean n-n-n-no ma'am\" Jon nervously said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MA'AM, just who do you think your calling Ma'am? I'm a gorgeous YOUNG lady and you should treat me as such. Unless you'd rather end up in this pissed off space pirate's stomach\" Ryoko said, the blood red gems on her wrist starting to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Bunny appeared and quickly handed Jon a rather LARGE thin white bottle, it was sake, the best (and only one) in the cafe. Jon gasped and frantically grabbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, right away pretty young lady\" Jon said, shoving the sake in front of his sweating face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the booze bottle set a warm smile to Ryoko's face, she giggled and smacked Jon down while she cradled the bottle as if it were a child. Already she could taste and smell the booze from her nostrils, that, and the healthy supply of fresh young meat littering around the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's what I call service, now I'd like to be seated please\" Ryoko said, with her sake in tow under her slender arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good Ryoko, space pirate miss, public or private\" Jon asked, rubbing his hands frightfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah, I don't care who sees me, I'm the space pirate of the galaxy after all\" Ryoko said with a snap of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just go with public then, right this way\" Jon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the waiter lead Ryoko to her seat, she could feel her stomach rippling like a fleshy tidal wave, crashing wave after wave upon her predatory senses. Oddly enough, the desire to consume flesh or meat of any kind was never really required for Ryoko to function, yet the deeper she went into the cafe the stronger those urges began emerging. By the time Ryoko had been seated, she found herself salivating for something ripe and tender to slip down her throat and fill her stomach with tasty delights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi I'm Bunny, your waiter, you have any ideas on who you'd like for dinner?\" the anthro cutie pie waiter said with a beaming, smile in her voice and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm I hear humans good, a delicacy in some galaxies\" Ryoko said, always wondering what humans tasted like after tasting Tenchi's lips with her forceful advances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any of these look to your liking?\" Bunny said, showing Ryoko a menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoko scanned the list and blinked as several caught her eye, a pity she had to settle on one, though at this rate, her stomach wouldn't wait much longer and even one would be enough so long as her slender gut was stuffed with sweet human meat right away! A girl with short green hair, a pink skirted dress, and a red bow in her head. One hand had a brown glove on it, the other didn't and the girl's shirt seemed to have her name printed on it, as well as next to her menu title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoko grinned \"Say, this Bulma sounds kinda yummy, maybe I'll have her.\" </span></div></div>",

Her large chest pushed out her low-cut top, creating a very nice outline of both her large breasts. Her tight leather pants fit her like a second skin. She was a total knock out with her strait blond hair that fell down just over her shoulders. She looked impatiently around her, studying the restaurant and the people eating in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould I take you to your seat, ma\u2019am?\u201d Jon asked politely, trying his hardest not to check out the customer. You\u2019d think that after having so many super endowed girls walk in with little clothes, he would be able to control his hormones better. Sadly, no matter how much exposure a man gets, their sex drive will always be running at top performance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, lead the way,\u201d Mai said, following Jon towards a table in the back of the restaurant. As they walked, Mai walked by the other tables, watching the people at them eating other people. She looked particularly interested at one customer, whom had a person hanging out of their mouths halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo people come to this restaurant to eat other people?\u201d Mai said, asking her question very calmly, as if she were asking about the weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYep, sometimes full-size, sometimes shrunken, sometimes they even take them to a private booth and do God knows what to them.\u201d Jon\u2019s answer made Mai pause and think for a moment. She deliberated on what she\u2019d learned, imagining herself with another person to eat. Finally, she fully grasped it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool,\u201d Mai said with a big smile on her pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon pointed out her table and Mai walked towards it. She took her seat and received her menu from Jon. She was left alone to look over then menu, staring at all the different people she could eat. Mai wasn\u2019t bothered at all by the idea that she was about to eat someone. It all seemed eerily normal to her and she gave it no more thought. Right now she wanted a meal, not so much to fill her up, but simply to enjoy. She saw a lot of cute boys and even a few girls that looked very appetizing. It was hard to choose with so many different options. A few minutes after sitting down, Bunny, the waitress, came over to see if Mai was ready to order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready for your meal?\u201d Mai looked up at the busty bunny girl and shook her head. She couldn\u2019t make up her mind on anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo many people to chose from,\u201d Mai said simply, returning her attention to the menu. As she was going over it once more, two young faces grew her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey waitress, can I order more then one person?\u201d The question had been nagging Mai, if she could, she really wished that she could have two young snacks on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure you can order two, you can order a hundred if you\u2019re able to stomach them all. But if I may be bold, may I suggest that you have them shrunken. That way it\u2019ll be harder for one to escape while you\u2019re eating the other.\u201d Mai nodded in agreement to that. She did want to savor her meal and she couldn\u2019t do that fully if she had to watch another person. If she had both shrunk, they\u2019d both be helpless to escape from her. Feeling very happy about her situation, Mai looked at her two picks. One was a young boy that looked around ten, but it said next to his name that he was fourteen. His name was Edward Elric from something called \u2018Full Metal Alchemist\u2019, whatever that means. The second was a young woman, with short blue hair and strange purple eyes. Her name was Eureka from something called \u2018Eureka Seven\u2019. Not particularly caring what the last part meant, Mai took a one last second to make certain that these were the people she wanted shrunken for her meal. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were young, so they\u2019d be full of energy and both were kind of cute, which would be good when she played around with them before she ate both. Mai pointed to the two young meals and Bunny nodded, getting the hint that Mai wanted the two of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a second with them both, would you like some sauces to go with them?\u201d Mai shook her head, their fear and despair would be all the extra zest Mai needed. The waitress left and Mai waited, licking her lips and imagining her two shrunken meals lying in a plate in front of her. This was going to be a meal she wouldn\u2019t soon forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#######################################################<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Ed Elric thought when he awoke was why his bed felt so cold and hard, and who turned off the lights. The last thing he\u2019d done was take a nap under a tree, while Al chased around a squirrel. He\u2019d been enjoying a peaceful break, away from searching for the Philosopher Stone and getting into danger. Now he seemed to have woken up in a strange place, with no idea how he got there or how long he\u2019d been out. Once it set in that he wasn\u2019t wear he was, Ed started crawling around, feeling his way around. The ground felt smooth to his touch and  as he felt around, he came to another discovery, all his clothes were gone. He felt around between his legs and felt not even his underwear left. Great, now he\u2019s been kidnapped and stripped, all he needed now was Roy showing up and his day would be complete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd continued to feel around him, searching for a light switch or a clue or something. He found something all right, while feeling around the floor, his hand grabbed something warm and soft. It was malleable to the touch and Ed squeezed it several times to get a better feel. He noticed a hard point in the middle and tugged it lightly, testing to see if it was attached to the soft object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRenton, cut it out,\u201d mumbled a female voice softly. At that moment, light poured in and Ed stared down into two purple eyes. He stared hard into the usual pair of irises, then he looked downward and saw what he\u2019d been squeezing.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeep!\u201d the alchemist shrieked and fell back onto his backside. He\u2019d accidentally been squeezing the girl\u2019s boob and that hard point had been her nipple. The girl rolled over to her side and looked at Edward. She had short blue hair and a round face that still had a bit of baby fat on it. Ed was drawn back to her strange purple eyes that seemed so surreal. He kept staring until he noticed that she was completely naked like him. He turned red when he noticed that her hair was naturally blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stared back at him, more interested in his metal leg and arm, then the fact that he was naked. She had never seen prosthetics like these before, they looked so medieval with all the bolts and raw steal. They were very unique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to stare, until the girl stared speaking. \u201cYou are not Renton, who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEd Elric, the Full Mental Alchemist.\u201d Ed said, unable to hold his pride as he said his name and title. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am simply Eureka and nothing more.\u201d Ed nodded slowly, her response had been a little weird, but this whole situation was very weird. He would of continued staring at Eureka if he hadn\u2019t heard someone giggling above him. Both youths looked upwards and gasped at the giant face hovering above them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey look so yummy,\u201d the giantess chuckled as she looked down at her plate and the two shrunken meals that were gasping up at her. The Bunny waitress nodded, appreciating that the customer was happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you like them, would you like to take them to a private booth, where you can eat more \u2018privately\u2019?\u201d Mia knew what the waitress meant and she thought about it.

What must they be thinking as they look up into her giant face? Were they marveled by her beauty, or scared witless? Whatever they were feeling was of little concern to Mai, she had her shrunken meals and she could do with them as she pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do feel like some privacy, lead the way.\u201d Bunny nodded to the customer and reached for the plate, but Mai stopped her. She could carry her own meal and she knew just the place to put them. Ed and Eureka screamed as Mai\u2019s well-manicured fingers reached for them on the plate, plucking them up easily, Mai stared at the frightened duo. With a wink, she pulled the top of her shirt out and let the tiny pair fall inside. Ed and Eureka hit her soft breasts and slid down between them. They came to a stop between the two supple mountains and remained there, as Mai positioned her bosom correctly to make certain they didn\u2019t fall out. Mai turned to Bunny and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLead the way.\u201d Bunny turned and started towards a pair of sliding doors near the back of the caf\u00e9. Mai followed, every step she took shook the tiny pair between her breasts. She felt them jumble around in her cleavage, rubbing against her skin and trying not to bump into one another. Mai made a point to sway her chest as she moved, feeling the different positions she could put the teens into. She felt tiny hands and legs kick around, trying desperately to find something to hold onto. If the few seconds it took Mai to reach her booth, both teens felt like they had been run through the rinse cycle. Mai looked over her booth, big table build with a futon on top, chairs that reclined back and plenty of room if she wanted to stretch out. In here, she was going to play with her little meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back later to see if you want seconds,\u201d Bunny said chirpily. Before leaving, Bunny added one more thing. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about stains or any other mess you make, everything comes out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone, Mai reached inside her shirt, she felt around as the two naked shrunken youngsters tried to avoid her giant fingers. Her cleavage might not be the best place, but both of them knew that whatever she had in store for them could be worse. Their struggles were pointless though; Mai grabbed them both and pulled them out. Both teens were red in the face, either from the heat between Mai\u2019s breasts or the closeness they had with each other and Mai\u2019s titillating flesh. Mai chuckled as both of them backed away from each other with mutual blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you two the cutest things,\u201d Mai cooed, lowering her head to the table to better look at them. The blonde-haired boy looked pissed and the blue haired one looked confused and worried. Mai couldn\u2019t blame them for feeling the way they did, they had both been demoted to toys for her pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s the deal, I\u2019m bored and horny, and I want to use you two for some fun. We could play the game where you\u2019re struggling helplessly and I\u2019m forcing you to do everything I want anyway, or you could follow my orders and not face the end result of the game.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the end result?\u201d Ed challenged, refusing to back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d Mai opened her mouth wide and pointed in, saliva dripped from her teeth, pooling around her tongue, which twitched with excitement. Ed and Eureka looked at one another. They didn\u2019t want to be this giantess\u2019s slaves, but being eaten sounded even worse. They were screwed no matter how they play the game.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jon could hardly believe his eyes. When he saw the short height of the girl he had expected it to be an older Hanabi but, instead he found a little girl of about 12 to 13 years of age, with lavender-white eyes, dark midnight hair in a well kept hime cut with the two bangs framing her cute and innocent face. She had on a tan jacket with white fur at the bottom and the cuffs of her sleeves. The Hyuga teardrop flame lay on top of a small yellow circle background on the side of her sleeves just under her shoulders. Finishing her attire was a pair of loose fitting dark blue pants and blue ninja sandals, her weapon pouch secured over her right cheek and kunai holster set firmly over the white bandages on her right thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the young girl shyly look around for a moment before he remembered to do his job. So, putting on a friendly smile he stepped forward to greet the young Hinata. \u201cGreetings, Hinata-san. Welcome to The Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9, where we treat our customers to the most unique meals of their lives. I\u2019m Jon and I\u2019ll be showing you to your seats.\u201d He added a bow during the greeting as was custom to her world and the honorific at the end of her name, just to be safe. Looking at the small girl as she shyly muttered a hello before continuing to glance around obviously confused about where she was and how she got there. Deciding to move this right along rather than leave her to stand about awkwardly, he proceeds to offer her a table. \u201cTable for one, or will someone else be joining you?\u201d Mentally cringing at the poor choice of words, considering what or <i>'who'</i> the caf\u00e9 served to its customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping slightly the young girl squeaked out a response. \u201cN-n-no. It\u2019s just-t m-me.\u201d She proceeded to look down at the ground, ashamed of her stutter. Jon however, paid it no mind and calmly asked her to fallow him to her table. He noticed how she would glance hungrily at some of the other customers or their meals as they passed, he\u2019d even swear he heard her stomach loudly growl out its demand for food. After showing her to a nice table in the back corner of the caf\u00e9 he handed her the menu and told her Bunny the serving girl would be there shortly to take her order. On his way back to the front he wondered if a certain blond boy she had a crush on might be unfortunate enough to end up as the shy girls\u2019 meal. He merely chuckled at the irony of the thought.<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\nBack with Hinata, the girl was looking over her menu with great zeal. Every person she saw made her mouth water, and though she keeps that at bay one could easily see the hunger in her lavender eyes. She was wondering how many people she could get away with eating at one time, paying no mind to how she just thought of eating another person without a shred of guilt. Many didn\u2019t know that Hinata never got to eat her fill due to Hyuga decorum. If she did she\u2019d easily match or even out do, her large friend Choji in terms of the amount of food she could eat before getting full. However, she wanted only the best meals going down her throat and digesting in her stomach, she would have to work off her meals after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the choices she wondered if she might find Naruto on the list, if she did she planned to eat him and make him a part of her. Stopping her survey of potential meals she thought, <i>\u2018Maybe for dessert. That way I can digest some of my other meals and enjoy him to the fullest.\u2019</i> A light blush crossed her face at the idea of Naruto covered in whip cream and chocolate sauce, before throwing herself back to looking for a meal with even more fever the before. <i>\u2018Maybe I should limit myself to just one sex. Hmm, most of the men are larger than their female counter parts, so I won\u2019t get to eat as many of them as I would the girls.\u2019</i> She\u2019d nearly squealed in joy when she found Naruto\u2019s name near the bottom on back of the menu and was just trying to see who she should eat as her appetizer.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThus far a Zero-suit Samus Aran, from someplace called Metroid, had caught her eye for a possible female appetizer, while some small child with odd hair called Yugi Muto and something about \u2018Dual Monsters\u2019 caught her attention for the male option. Now the young hunger 13 year old girl had to make a choice, would she be having an all male meal or would she be dining on attractive females with a dessert order of Naruto?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bunny just looked surprised at the question. \u201cWell no, there isn\u2019t a limit other then how many you want to eat. We do have a 7-course challenge which includes 1 appetizer, 5 main courses, and 1 dessert. We even have a small sound-proof room in the back for anyone who tries the challenge so they can digest their meals in piece. But, no one has ever eaten more than 4 meals before.\u201d Hearing this Hinata debated with herself on whether or not to try the challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what are the rules?\u201d Shocked, Bunny could only mutter an \u201cExcuse me!\u201dA small tilt of her head being the only sign of possible confusion before Hinata asked again. \u201cThe challenge. What are the rules?\u201d she didn\u2019t even notice that she wasn\u2019t stuttering anymore. Bunny scratched her head with her pen before answering in a somewhat uncertain voice. \u201cW-well\u2026 You make each order separately so that if you can\u2019t continue there are no wasted orders. You have as long as you like to finish the challenge, I think. You can\u2019t however, wait till your previous meal is completely digested before ordering you next course. If we allowed that then it wouldn\u2019t be much of a challenge. Sadly we can\u2019t go shrinking your orders for this challenge so you need to be able to swallow them at full size. When finished merely inform me and I bring you to the spare room so you can rest and finish digesting your 7 courses\u2026 I think that\u2019s it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata asked a few more questions and found that she could put off ordering her next course till half of her last course was all that remained sloshing around in her stomach. She also learned that Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9 could not be held responsible should she eat too much and run the risk of bursting, something Hinata was not worried about at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow knowing what she would be facing, Hinata choose to take the challenge and ordered one Zero-suit Samas Aran as her appetizer and put in the request for one Naruto Uzumaki to be placed as her dessert, just in case someone else tried to get him before she finished off the other six girls. Bunny quickly jotted down her first order and the request all the while hoping the little girl wouldn\u2019t try to force so many larger girls down her throat if she couldn\u2019t handle it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jon has seen some women come into the restaurant in bikinis or underwear, but none of them had ever filled out their skimpy clothes like the woman in front of her. Wearing what can only be described as a leather bikini, a tall woman in her mid-twenties stood confidently in the entrance to the caf\u00e9. Even though Jon knew he should be focusing on his job, he couldn\u2019t help, but ogle the sexy woman standing proudly in front of him. He opened his mouth to greet her again, but before he could say anything, the woman tilted her head back and let out a shrill high-pitched laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer laughter sounded to Jon what you\u2019d hear if a cat was being beaten to death with a blow horn. He clutched his ears and fell to the ground. All the other customers did the same, as well as the meals that looked ready to jump into someone\u2019s mouth just to escape the horrible laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeakly, Jon looked up when the laughter subsided, the beautiful woman with the laugh of death looked down her nose at Jon with contempt.

Jon removed his hand and Naga sneered at him, she didn\u2019t like being touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should save your energy for eating,\u201d Jon explained, knowing that telling her that her laugh could kill cockroaches wouldn\u2019t be a good idea. Naga nodded slowly, seeing some wisdom in Jon\u2019s words. She left Jon and walked to her table, eager to start eating. Sitting down, Naga opened the menu and began studying the pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll need to start off with someone small if I\u2019m going to be able to stuff myself.\u201d Naga said thoughtfully as she studied all the pictures.  Her eyes settled on a redheaded girl with a large bust and a cocky smile. Her name was Ranma and to Naga she looked yummy, but was she really the one she wanted or was this treat better saved for another time?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was wearing sweats, which on her shapely body didn\u2019t seem make her that bad looking. Jon recognized her as Videl, the teenage girlfriend of Gohan from Dragonball Z series. She looked weary, but also excited to be here. Jon could tell right away that he had a very hungry customer here, who wasn\u2019t going to be leaving until they either ran out of meals or her belly buckled. He stepped up to her to formally greet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome, may I take you to your table?\u201d Jon gave Videl a bow because he knew she was from an oriental world, where such things were commonplace. Videl smiled at the courteous gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, could you get me a towel first. I just came from training and I\u2019m a little sweaty,\u201d Videl replied with a slight blush. She had wanted to clean up before eating, but her hunger had won out and she\u2019d decided to go eat before showering. Jon nodded to her request and walked quickly to the bathroom to pick up a towel for the waiting customer. He weaved past tables, avoiding bloated customers with wiggling bellies. He moved out of the way in time to miss Bunny, who was carrying a huge covered tray holding God who knows who. He reached the bathroom and found a neatly stacked pile of towels near the sink. Often there were messes when eating live people, so towels were kept in the bathroom for the messes too big for napkins. Taking one from the top, Jon rushed out of the bathroom and back to Videl.  She gratefully took the towel from him and swabbed her forehead of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat service,\u201d Videl commended. \u201cI think there\u2019s a special tip in store for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing like a schoolgirl, Jon looked at his feet embarrassedly. He had only been doing his job of keeping the customers happy. Maybe he had done more then what was expected of him, but he didn\u2019t mind. After all, the last thing he wanted to do was get on the bad side of someone that could eat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to be taken to your table?\u201d Jon humbly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf coarse,\u201d Videl answered cheerfully. She was still hungry and needed a nice meal to fill her belly. Jon took her to her table, passing the customers he\u2019d speeded by a moment ago. Once they\u2019d gotten to their table, Videl sat down and was handed a menu. Jon started to leave, but Videl quickly stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need your opinion. My boyfriend\u2026er\u2026 I mean sensei,\u201d Videl corrected herself. Thee was no reason for Jon to know she was attached, yet. \u201cHe eats tons and gets really strong and fights really well. I know on occasion him and his family eats here and orders a blend of different people. I was told that the gender of the meal sometimes determines the calories and fat. What gender would you suggest I order from if I want to gain muscles?\u201d Jon thought about it. He\u2019d heard something about different genders have different affects on the body once they\u2019re digested. But which one was the best for Videl? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a bit of rummaging through his papers, he kinda smiles a bit as the results! \"Heh! What do you know? We got a special on voice-actors! Buy one cartoon or video game character with a speaking role, get another done by the same voice-actor free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, sounds like quite a deal!\" Videl obviously seems up for that special, \"What would be a good choice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon had to think about... for about a microsecond! \"I highly recommend the Crispin Freeman! We got a nice succulent Albedo Piazolla from Xenosaga that might go good with a side of Shougo Amakusa from Rurouni Kenshin!

Both Lady Emmaniel and Satan at the same time! Sure, they were gorgeous, no doubt. But they were also the greatest and most powerful villainesses from the \"My Balls\" manga!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"So, this is the \"Ravenous Caf\u00e9 we heard about, huh?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Yes.

You two are quite famous and your reputation precedes you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I see.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"Not surprising.

But, please, wait a minute.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could object, you went running as fast as you can to get the red carpet in the Caf\u00e9's storage. You weren't sure if you should take it. It was for special patrons only. But this was Satan and Emmaniel so, you took it anyway. But, before you could get out of the storage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"What are you doing with the red carpet, Jon?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I was going to extend it.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Why? Who arrived?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Two very powerful Devils. Satan and Emmaniel. We need to treat them as best as we can.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Oh! Okay then. Go ahead.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Thanks, Bunny.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"You're welcome.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to the kitchen's entrance and unrolled the carpet. It extended until it reached the Caf\u00e9's entrance. Seeing this surprised both Devil's. You then went to where they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I hope your stay here is pleasant, Satan-sama, Emmaniel-sama. I shall take you to your table now.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that you extended the red carpet for them and your behavior indeed pleased the two of them. After all, no human had ever been so courteous and polite with them. Not to mention that you had added \"sama\" to their names. Meaning that you respected them and that you knew your place. Also, they noticed that the more they entered the caf\u00e9, the hungrier they got. They followed you to a table that had chandelier in the center with three black candles. The table itself seemed made of pure oak and styled after the ones that were usually found in royal gardens. The chairs were the same style and were made oak as well. However, they had a this line of gold colored in the borders. The tablecloth was blood red colored with purple embroidery. The table was next to a couple of windows that were blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"Why are these windows blank?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"It's because not everyone enjoys the same view. So we installed special windows that change according to the customer's tastes. One for each customer. This, Emmaniel-sama, Satan-sama, is the best table in the whole caf\u00e9.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, both, impressed and pleased even more the pair of devils. Until now, to them, you had proved that you knew how to deal with people of their class. Also, they noticed that you weren't bad looking at all. They then sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well then, I shall call Bunny. She'll get you order.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Actually...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Satan-sama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"We would prefer that you keep serving us.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I see. Unfortunately, I need to get back to my post and attend the other customers that may come.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"Oh, come on. Keep serving us, please?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Emmaniel was asking you something \"please\"? Now that was unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well... I shouldn't do this but, I suppose I can ask Bunny to take my post for a while, since not many customers are coming.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"Thank you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Indeed.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"You're welcome.

You found her in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Bunny?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Yes? What is it, Jon?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Well, Satan and Emmaniel asked me to keep serving them so, you think you could occupy my post for a while?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Sure!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Really?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Yeah!

Now go.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Okay. Thanks again.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to attend Satan and Emmaniel. In the meanwhile, the two devils were chatting about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"So? What do you think of our attendant?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chunter\">\"I think he knows who he's dealing with. And he's the first human to treat us like this.

Her purple top and skirt hugged her curves tightly, heightening the young ladies appeal. Her green eyes wandered over the restaurant and its patrons.  What stood out about her the most to Jon was her tanned orange skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I show you to your table, Starfire?\u201d Jon said politely, as he held a menu tightly at his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d The colorful member of the animated series the Teen Titans asked, looking at Jon curiously. She was quiet hungry, but this human was interesting, maybe he could explain to her why she was suddenly so hungry and felt the need to eat another person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon groaned, he\u2019d forgotten the first rule, none of the characters knew they weren\u2019t real. Straitening himself up and mentally reminding himself to watch what he said next time, Jon pointed towards an empty table where Starfire could be seated. \u201cThat\u2019s not important, you have a table waiting and a meal that isn\u2019t getting any younger.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I mustn\u2019t let my meal wait,\u201d Starfire said with a wide grin. She hadn\u2019t even realized what she had said, all that mattered to the hungry alien was filling her stomach with something that wiggled. Jon smiled slightly at seeing Starfire forget about his blunder. He\u2019d forgotten how easily distracted the female hero was in the cartoon. He walked towards Starfire\u2019s table, with the girl trailing behind him holding her stomach. She\u2019d suddenly felt a jolt of hunger pain and now felt even more famished. When she got to her table she took her seat and received her menu from Jon. He went back to the entrance to wait for the next customer, who would hopefully be as easy to manage as Starfire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoohhhhh, look at all the people,\u201d Starfire gleefully said to herself, eyeing all the different people she could chose from. The boys looked so meaty and the girls were so soft and appetizing.  She wanted to look at the pictures some more, study their faces and tantalize over how yummy they all must be, but her hunger was growing and she knew she had to order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe redheaded human female looks nice,\u201d she said, then read the name, Gwen Tennyson. There was a strange note beside her picture saying something about being from \u2018Ben 10\u2019. Starfire didn\u2019t understand what that meant, but as long as it didn\u2019t make the girl taste yucky, she didn\u2019t care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready to order?\u201d Starfire turned to Bunny, who was looking over her shoulder with a big smile. Starfire stopped to think, would she settle for this redheaded female called \u2018Gwen\u2019 as her meal?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYes, Miss Bunny human, I am ready to order. I\u2019d like the human female named Gwen,\u201d Starfire said elatedly. She wanted so much to taste human flesh and feel it wiggle inside her that the young alien was practically drooling. She\u2019d never had this desire for sustenance before, so she had very little control over her zeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like her shrunken down or taken to a private booth, where you can do anything you want to your meal away from peeping toms,\u201d Bunny giggled. Starfire stared vacantly at the ditzy server. Whatever could she do to her meal that she couldn\u2019t do in the open? She didn\u2019t dwell on it long, she knew what she wanted and it wasn\u2019t privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like her unshrunken, please. Also, I\u2019m only going to be eating her so unless I\u2019ll need privacy for that, I\u2019ll stay at this table.\u201d Bunny nodded and wrote something down on her notepad. Starfire supposed that it was probably her order, but was actually just a doodle of a pony Bunny was making to occupy her vacant mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go get her in a moment.\u201d Then the bunny girl was off. Using the speed that most would associate with someone whose characteristics matched a rabbit, Bunny headed into the back. Starfire waited at her table, licking her lips and imagining how delightful her meal was going to be. She hoped her meal was friendly; it would be so nice if they had a friendly chat before she was digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Bunny came out of the kitchen, carrying a four-by-four round covered plate that wobbled back and forth, as she walked. She carried the huge tray with one hand, unaffected by the huge weight of what she was carrying. She sauntered over to Starfire\u2019s table and placed the plate down. It took up most of the table, glistening like an offering to an almightily God. Starfire rubbed her hands and watched with wide eyes as Bunny lifted up the cover and revealed the young girl underneath. She had short red hair and emerald eyes that reminded Starfire of her own. Her blue shirt featured a tiny cat head on it and she wore tight blue jeans. Starfire poked her meal gingerly and Gwen intent looked at Starfire with irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better let me go or else,\u201d Gwen growled. She had no idea where she was or how she\u2019d got here. All she remembered was going to sleep and waking up on a plate with this alien looking at her. She didn\u2019t know how, but Gwen knew this had to be Ben\u2019s fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m Starfire. You are Gwen. I\u2019m going to eat you,\u201d Starfire said with a big friendly smile. Gwen stared impassively at Starfire, unable to fully comprehend what the strange orange girl had said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, did you say you were going to eat me?\u201d Gwen barked, not liking this one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d Starfire chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen took a deep breath, not to calm herself down, but rather to get enough air into her longs for what she was about to say. \u201cListen here, you ditzy, purple headed bimbo. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m some cuisine on your back water planet, I\u2019m Gwen Tennyson and no one, especially a dumb bitch like you, eats me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re mean,\u201d Starfire sulked, not liking one bit what her meal was saying. She didn\u2019t understand most of what she\u2019d been called, but she knew they weren\u2019t good. \u201cI wanted to talk before eating, but I see you\u2019re too rude to talk to. So I\u2019m just going to eat you and nothing more.\u201d Starfire reached for Gwen, trying to decide how she was going to eat the rude, rude, human.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Starfire popped her jaw open as wide as they would go. Gwen watched the lovely little mouth of the alien princess become a gapping cavern able to easily fit something large, like say her head.  Gwen tried to crawl away, but before she can move very far, Starfire grabs her by the shoulders and pulls the frightened human towards her gaping maw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, don\u2019t do this. If you really want to talk then lets taAAAKKKK!\u201d The last part became a muffled scream because Starfire had thrust Gwen\u2019s whole head into her cavern like mouth. Starfire licks Gwen\u2019s face, sampling her scrumptious flavor and then pulled her head over Gwen\u2019s, engulfing the helpless girl\u2019s skull down to her shoulders.  Gwen\u2019s screams were muffled by Starfire\u2019s mouth as she massaged her prey\u2019s back and negotiates her shoulders past her yawning lips. Starfire took a moment to use her tongue to softly lick Gwen\u2019s neck as it entered her mouth leisurely. Although Gwen seemed like a rotten human, her taste was very juicy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire\u2019s drool ran down Gwen\u2019s head, soaking her in the transparent gunk. Gwen batted her eyelids until she had gotten the saliva out of her eyes, just in time to see the throat open up and start to accept her head into it\u2019s tight channel. Steadying herself by holding Gwen around the waist, Starfire pushed Gwen further in, taking her shoulders and part of her chest. Gwen\u2019s feet are kicking around and her hands were trying to desperately find anything to grab on to, but it is all futile. Without any advantage, Gwen could only wiggle around, spreading her flavor around Starfire\u2019s mouth and making Starfire as happy as a clam. She had never tasted anything this good before and it was only going to get better. Starfire had not even eaten half of Gwen and she was already overloaded with the taste of the redheaded human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her inhuman strength, Starfire managed to tilt Gwen up, lifting her legs off the plate and into the air. Gwen\u2019s screams intensified when she could no longer feel the ground beneath her. Slowly, Gwen started to sink rapidly into Starfire, disappearing with every second her feet were in the air. Starfire\u2019s neck bulged out in the shape of Gwen\u2019s head, as the bulge traveled down to her chest, slowly nearing the stomach. When Gwen has sunk down to her waist, Starfire lowered her mouth, allowing her to control the pace of how fast she devours Gwen. Breathing through her nose, allowed Starfire to take a large gulp of her meal, dragging her down nearly half a foot. A murmur of pleasure vibrated off Gwen, as Starfire felt her taste pushed across her sensitive tongue. Gwen\u2019s thighs vanished into the alien\u2019s greedy mouth with a wet slurp; it wouldn\u2019t be long now before all of Gwen was inside Starfire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer throat still bulged with Gwen\u2019s shape, but was getting thinner as Gwen was only a few mouthfuls away from being a complete meal. Starfire\u2019s stomach began to swell out with the form of Gwen as it readily emptied into there. It was a good thing Starfire\u2019s clothes left her waist bare because if she\u2019d been wearing a shirt it would have been stretched out, and the ripped. Starfire took a moment to enjoy her meal before it was gone one final time. She closed her eyes to savor the wriggling squirms, which were now weakening as Gwen was confined, squeezed and tired from screaming and struggling.  Gwen\u2019s head was pushed down past the ring of flesh separating Starfire\u2019s stomach from her throat. Gwen couldn\u2019t see anything in the sack of flesh, but if she could she\u2019d see a cavity, just big enough for her to fit inside, with a tiny bit of stomach acid waiting to digest her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Starfire took the final few gulps to finish the rude human off. Gwen\u2019s calves slipped into her mouth, then her feet, and then, with a final slurp, Gwen was gone and Starfire\u2019s stomach swelled out. One last, muffled scream was heard as Gwen was dumped into the stomach and forced curl up within the wet, hot belly. Starfire smacking his lips and belched, patting her swollen belly before leaning back on her chair to enjoy the last movements of her prey. She wondered if she even had any energy left to eat another human after Gwen was finished digesting or if it was better to just leave now with only one human feast.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her wardrobe consisted of a mini-skirt and tight white top that together hugged her features tightly. Her long brown hair swayed behind her, breaking into two curls of hair at the end. She was absently rubbing her stomach and licking her lips, two signs that the young lady from Nibelheim was feeling the hunger for another human being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I take you to your table?\u201d Jon asked politely.  He saw the uncertain look in Tifa eyes and knew that he was going to have to lead her gradually to a table until she got her wits about her. He took a step forward, looking behind him to see if Tifa was following. Tifa snapped to attention when Jon started moving and looked at the young man like she was seeing him for the first time. A small smile formed on her lips and she closely followed Jon to her seat. She couldn\u2019t explain why or how, but she wanted to eat someone, preferably a boy, but she\u2019d settle for a girl if need be. It seemed like an insane idea, but since Tifa walking into the caf\u00e9, it was all she could think about. Somehow, she knew she could eat someone and digest him or her, but she didn\u2019t know how. She decided to stop focusing on it and instead look forward to what was a head of her, a yummy boy to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa was taken to her table in the middle of the restaurant and sat down. Jon left her alone with a menu he\u2019d taken from the entrance and Tifa eagerly opened it up and started trying to decide whom she was going to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at all the boys,\u201d she giggled, trailing her finger over one of their pictures. \u201cThey look so cute. Of coarse they aren\u2019t as cute as my Cloud, but who is?\u201d Tifa chuckled and imagined what it would be like if Cloud was dining with her. She\u2019d order a hunk and he\u2019d have that annoying brat Aerith. It would be perfect; they could have a romantic dinner, while Aerith was slowly digestion inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt could only get better if he was the meal,\u201d Tifa said to herself, imagining Cloud inside her stomach. She shivered in delight at the prospect of that happening. Tifa returned her eyes to the menu, trying to see if maybe, just maybe, her beloved Cloud was one of the set of choices.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Groaning, Tifa put down the menu and sulked, she wasn\u2019t going to get to eat Cloud. Her brooding lasted for a few seconds; and then she pickled the menu up again and started scanning the pictures, looking for the cutest and most appetizing boy on the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might not be able to eat my Cloud, but I can still eat a cute boy.\u201d She cackled, getting a few odd stares from some other patrons. Tifa could feel her pulse quicken and her mind go a buzz as she fantasized over all her choices of different men she could eat. Some were mere boys, only twelve or thirteen, while others were in their teens. They ranged from buff to skinny, short to tall, tanned to pale. She wanted them all, but knew that her stomach could only hold so many. She needed to pick a good one to start off on, a warm up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe might not have her Cloud to dine with or on, but she was going to stuff her face with as many boys as she could handle. To begin with, Tifa decided to eat someone young and small. Not too burly, but without any baby fat. It was as she was looking that Bunny came to her table, to see if her new customer was ready to order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know what you want?\u201d The bunny girl asked curiously, letting one ear flop down, while she looked at Tifa questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaw, I can\u2019t make my mind up on a boy. They all look so yummy and filling, I don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d Tifa relying, not looking up from the menu. Bunny remained silence as Tifa reviewed the menu one more time. This time her eyes settled on one boy near the end. He looked kind of normal, but his vivid blue eyes reminded Tifa of Clouds. His name was Shinji Ikari and it read beside his name that he was from Neon Genesis Evangelion. Strange name for a country, Tifa thought as she looked between the picture and her stomach. Did she want Shinji inside her belly? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Due to this, she has gone through and experienced things that would break even people like war veterans, let alone a child.

Her long cat ears poked out from both sides of her head, while her tail waved lazily behind her. She might have looked relaxed, but Jon could tell that she was on the hunt. How much of a hunt she was going to get Jon wasn\u2019t sure. It was hard to imagine having the prey carried to your table as very sportsmanly.<br>\r\nAisha raised her nose to the air and sniffed around her. This wasn\u2019t an uncommon thing for the more furrier customers of the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeow, I smell so many yummy terrans in the kitchen and some other creatures that I can\u2019t quiet place.\u201d Aisha sounded unsure of herself. She could detect the scent of human, but something else, something exotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a wide assortment of humans, aliens, antros, were-creatures, robots, lizard men and I think we may have a few heavenly bodies fresh in today.\u201d Aisha nodded, letting herself be led to her table while Jon listed all the bizarre creatures she could eat. Aisha felt a strange sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when she walked into the restaurant, like she\u2019d been there before. Shaking her head to throw off these strange thoughts she was getting, Aisha took her seat at the table Jon had led her to. She shuffled around several times in her chair, feeling how sturdy it was. It would have to be sturdy because when she finished eating, Aisha planned to be as heavy as an elephant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s your menu, look over it and see if there is anyone you\u2019d like to eat.\u201d Jon handed Aisha the menu slowly. He\u2019d seen over eager patrons rip it out of his hands in their frenzy to get fed and Although Aisha seemed compliant at the moment, Jon knew better then to expect it to remain the same when the hunger hit her. Jon left the carnivorous Ctarl Ctarl and went back to his post at the front of the door, there would be more hungry characters coming any moment now and he couldn\u2019t let them wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAisha flipped open the menu and stared hard at the long line of names beside pictures. Jon hadn\u2019t been kidding when he said the restaurant had a lot of different pray, Aisha saw creatures on the menu that made her look normal. She studied the rows of pictures, examining the features and small tidbits beside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSays this ones an alien, but this other one is a demon,\u201d Aisha muttered to herself slowly. Her eyes traveled from one picture to the next, mapping out the ones that looked the most delicious. Her eyes set themselves on the picture of a young boy with a big smile and a spiky blond hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCloud Strife,\u201d Aisha read the name beside the picture. He looked young and full of life, the perfect combination for her meals. Also, when she looked really close at his picture, he almost looked like Jim. He would be a good choice for her first meal at the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bunny\u2019s ears stand up when they hear Aisha\u2019s scratchy voice. The waitress turns to her latest customer and hops towards her merrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I get for you, Miss Kitty?\u201d Aisha chose to ignore the Miss Kitty comment and smiled viscously at the waitress. She was on the hunt and she\u2019d just found her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want the one called Cloud, he looks like a fighter, and no, I won\u2019t have him shrunken or taken to a private room. I want my prey to be full size when I devour his sorry ass,\u201d Aisha chuckled, as Bunny wrote that down. She looked over at Aisha, whom was almost drooling as she imagined her Cloud meal that was on its way. It warmed Bunny\u2019s heart to see the feline predator so happy. Bunny loved her job because it allowed her to make so many hungry predators happy. This was mostly because Bunny was from a race of prey that lived solely to feed bigger, stronger predators. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have him out in a jiffy,\u201d Bunny said, then turned to leave. But before she walked away, she remembered something important she\u2019d forgotten to mention. \u201cBy the way, Cloud\u2019s a little bit of a fighter so if he tries to escape\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll wallop his butt good,\u201d Aisha finished, grinning happily that her assessment was true and cloud was a fighter. Eating smaller, weaker prey was good sometimes, but she liked the strong, never give up, never back down types in her stomach. She watched the Bunny girl go into the kitchen to retrieve cloud for her. While Bunny was rounding up Aisha\u2019s meal, the Ctarl-Ctarl girl started loosening her top so it didn\u2019t burst when she was stuffed full of spiky haired Terran. She knew she\u2019d bloat out like a week old fish in the sun, but she didn\u2019t care. Her metabolism could brake down her meal quickly and leave her as trim as before she came to the restaurant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunny came out of the kitchen carrying a hogtied Cloud on her shoulder. He\u2019d been struggling too much to stay on his plate, so Bunny had to carry him out without the serving dish.  She hoped the condition of the meal didn\u2019t discourage Aisha from eating him. Seeing her prey without a plate didn\u2019t affect Aisha\u2019s appetite at all. If anything, seeing her prey in the flesh made Aisha feel even hungrier. She wanted Cloud in her stomach now and nothing short of Hojo was going to stop her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunny placed the still hogtied man on Aisha\u2019s table gently, so not to bruise the meat. Bunny looked at Aisha, who was wiping her saliva off her mouth with the back of her hand. Smiling, Bunny reminded Aisha one more time that Cloud was a fighter and may attack her. Aisha looked at the bunny girl and waved her off. She was a Ctarl-Ctarl; she could handle any male, no matter who they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome to mama,\u201d Aisha said as she slashed Clouds bindings off, so he could start eating. As Cloud was released, his right arm shoot up towards Aisha\u2019s face, ready to punch his enemy strait on the nose. He wasn\u2019t about to become anyone\u2019s meal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aisha\u2019s clawed hands grasped his hips and torso, his thrashing arms were ignored for the moment so Aisha could saver her first taste of the blond Terran. Her tongue slobbered all over Clouds entrapped face, sliding over and around his head, soaking him, coating him in her wet saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud grit his teeth and raised his hands to Aisha\u2019s lips to pull them open, but before he could lock his fingers, Aisha grew bored of tasting him and decided to get the show on the road. Cloud\u2019s head was pushed down s further and with a sudden swallow, he found his head sliding down into her throat. Inside Aisha\u2019s throat, the soft, wet channel engulfed him, clinging tightly to him; the muscles tightened and squeezed him until his shoulder started to join him in the throat. <br>\r\nWhen Cloud was being stuffed mercilessly into Aisha\u2019s throat, the cat girl was in hog heaven. Her drool ran down his chest, dribbling down onto the table where he was still partially lying on. She loved the taste of his well-toned flesh and she wanted to taste more of it so badly. Another swallow came, causing a liquid sucking sound from her throat working at him down. His chest was inside her throat now, both his arms were pinned uselessly to his sides, leaving him unable to do anything else but struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud\u2019s body was big enough that her throat wasn't a perfect seal around him, some air leaking in each time she gulped, enough that he was going to stay conscious all the way down her throat, which Cloud didn\u2019t know was a good thing or a bad thing. Aisha\u2019s teeth grazed Clouds back as she swallowed him down to the waist, dragging him further into her. His legs kicked about now that he could no longer use his arms, which didn\u2019t help him escape, but did annoy Aisha. She was trying to eat here; it was so distracting watching her prey try to swim out of her gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrasping him by the calves to end his futile, but distracting movements, Aisha swallowed one more, causing her throat to close over his hands and suddenly her mouth was gripping his rump and groin. The sudden feeling of Aisha\u2019s hot, wet mouth over such a sensitive area made Cloud jolted in the tight confines of Aisha\u2019s throat. Aisha smiled slightly at feeling her prey\u2019s movements inside her and wondered if he might slightly be enjoying the idea that his crotch was in her mouth. Aisha decided to stop any notion he might have that this was going to be sexual and take the rest of him in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused in her swallowing and lifted her head up, pulling him clear of the table and slowly tilting back. Cloud felt his body straightening out, his peddling in open air. By now, his young body was bulging out the tanned throat of his catlike predator. His struggles were slightly visible beneath that soft skin, when it would vibrate. Cloud took deep breathes of the stale air in Aisha\u2019s throat, wondering how the hell he was going to get out of this. It struck him like a bullet then that he might not be escaping from this one. His energy left him and he went limp in Aisha\u2019s throat, he was going to die and nothing was going to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cloud struggled to accept his coming death, Aisha was taking deep breaths from her nose for the final swallow. She looked past her lips at Clouds feet, which had just suddenly stopped kicking. Not aware of the reason or really caring at all, Aisha mustered her strength and started to rapidly swallow. Cloud was washed down her throat with a set of sudden convulsions of the throat. His legs kicked once, twice, and then Aisha\u2019s mouth closed behind them and the tongue swept lightly over both feet before disappearing within the Ctarl-Ctarl. Aisha sighed in satisfaction, while Cloud was dumped into her stomach. The muscular walls closed in around him, massaging the digestive juices into his flesh. As Aisha was patting her stomach, Cloud was losing consciousness and falling into a dreamless sleep. To pass the time until Cloud was completely digested, Aisha glanced at the menu and wondered if she really had room for seconds. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Our restaurant has a select clientele of anime, video game, cartoon, comic, movie and television characters, who dine on other characters that we \u2018acquire\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have all kinds of customers, some male, others female and even a few animals. Everyone loves to eat at the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif\"> Main courses </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCustomers enter the restaurant with an uncontrollable hunger, accepting the hunger for our meals without question. After eating, they leave with their experience at our establishment erased from their memories. This helps because sometimes our customers will end up as meals the next time they come to the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meals are often frightened and will not want to be eaten in fear of being digested. However, all meals are returned back to their homes, perfectly fine and with no memory of their experience at our restaurant after they have been completely digested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif\"> Deserts </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur customers are given the option of having their meals shrunken down for them at any time, giving them a quick snack on the go. Just ask for them to be shrunken before they come to the table and our friendly waitress will do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe also offer private booths, where customers can do whatever they please with their meals. Remember, what happens in the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9, stays in the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9. Customers only have to ask their waitress to take them to a private booth, where they can unbirth, anal vore or do anything else they please away from prying eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finished their meal, the customers can either have seconds or leave. If they leave, look towards another customer to see how happy they are with their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif\"> Staff </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon Masters- Your greeter, he will welcome you to the restaurant and show you to your table. A slim man with brown eyes and hair, some customers say seeing his trusting smile when they walk through the door sets the mood for the whole meal. He has only worked at the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9 for a few weeks, but is quickly becoming a member of the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunny- Your waitress, she will take your order and bring your meal to you from the kitchen strait to your table. Bunny is a cheerful bunny girl, with green eyes, red hair and a rabbit tail and ears. She will merrily deliver your meal, without complain about the size or crying of the cuisine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManagement- Owns the Rav\u00e9nous Caf\u00e9, never seen out of their office. No one knows his or her gender, age or race.<br>\r\n</td>",
