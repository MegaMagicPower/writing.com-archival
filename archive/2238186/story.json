At why last night Jack had came up with a plan to trick his friend into getting fat looking at the brown paper bag under the bench Jack was brought out of his thoughts by Tom placing a hand on  his shoulder <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok Jack I been calling your name since I got out of the pool \"said Tom looking at his teammate and friend with a concerned look still dripping with water this almost made Jack feel bad about what he was about to do almost <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah am fine was just having a daydream \" replied Jack with a fake laugh and quickly changed the subject \" I got us something to eat \" said Jack pulling out the brown paper bag from under the bench and taking out two burgers and a  two packs of fries Tom just looked at Jack confused <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that at not part of are diet the coaches will be really mad if they catch us eating that stuff plus we dont want get fat \" said Tom a little worried as he placed a hand on his six pack through he had to admit it had been a long time since he had burger and fries and they smelt really nice almost making Tom drool  a bit he quickly blushed a little for even thinking of eating them <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It fine their vegan completely healthy trust me you wont be able to tell the different taste just like the real thing \"lied Jack trying to hid his smirk he had actually gotten them from McDonald's and just placed the burgers and fries in a  plain brown paper bag Jack felt himself become nervous as he waited for Tom to make a  decision hoping that he didn't over sell how good the burger was. Tom looked to his friend and to burger and fries and decided to eat it after all why would Jack lie to him about them  being vegan Tom took the offered burger from Jack hand and quickly unwrapped it  and carefully took a  bite his eyes widened as he tasted it Jack was right this tasted just like the real thing Tom quickly took another bite <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man your right this is amazing \"said Tom his mouth still full Jack just smiled and nodded to his friend happy that his plan was off to a great start as he only eat a couple of fries ten minutes later Tom had devoured his burger and fries while Jack still had his burger and most of his fries \" Aren't you going to eat yours ?\"asked Tom placing a  hand on his belly feeling full <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah am not hungry as I thought I was you can have it \"replied  Jack pushing the burger and fries over to Tom who quickly grabbed it and started to eat it hating letting food go to waste he quickly eat the burger and fries leaving Tom bloated his bloated belly going over his speedos <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At was so good wish I could eat that every day \"said Tom rubbing his bloated belly and licking a bit of sauces from  his fingers <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why dont you they are healthy after all and I will make sure you can get them just come to me or text me when you want one \"said Jack happy imagining what Tom would look like when he was fat <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am definitely going to do that \"said Tom smiling as he was already thinking about eating the burgers for his next meal <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later </span></div></div>",

And he was now seeing the consequences in Tom trusting him. Tom's speedo looked like a second layer of skin as it hugged his thighs, any more weight added there and Jack was sure that they would rip off. Jack could also see that a small belly was now forming at Tom's midsection. He was surprised that Tom seemed to have added so much weight to his frame in such a short time time, it had only bee a week after all. He was wondering if Tom had been eating them religiously since he told them that it was vegan food. But then again wouldn't have Tom know that they weren't vegan if had been eating them religiously because of his added weight, Jack was in a bind of what was happening, the only conclusion that he could come to that Tom was oblivious to his weight gain. Nonetheless Jack decided to poke the bear. \"Hey those shorts looking kinda snug on you Tom\" Jack suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom sighed, \"Yeah I know what you mean, I think they shrunk in the wash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat decided it, Tom was oblivious to his weight gain. \"Yeah it looks like it, you have to be care with those washer settings, so they won't shrink. Jack said playing along<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about and its just not these shorts its also a lot of my regular clothes' to have been getting kind of snug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way\" Jack said, doing everything he could to hide his sarcasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Dustin went out shopping today to make sure I have clothes to wear, what would I do without him\" Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Tom mentioned it, he wondered what Dustin thought of all of this, there was no way he was as clueless as Tom or he could be, Tom's small was just a small bump at this point, maybe some little sympathy weight he assumed would go away.  \"Yeah you're a lucky guy to have him\" Jack said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe two divers got dressed back in their regular clothes as they made their way out of the changing room it was then...</span></div></div>",

Jack just nodded in understanding before they reached Dustin and Tom but before they could go their separate ways Dustin suddenly turned  around to face them <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack why dont you come over for dinner I always end up making way to much for me and Tom to mange on are own \"said Dustin with a warm smile <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure \"said Jack instantly wanting to see what Dustin and Tom were actually eating later on Tom went to try on the new clothes Dustin had gotten him Jack took this opportunity to ask Duran about Tom weight gain \"Have you noticed at Tom putting on a little weight?\"asked Jack wanting to see Dustin reaction <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes but am pretty sure he just bulking and will and will work it off a eventually \" replied Dustin as he went to make dinner Jack smiled to himself that his plan for Tom was working Dustin getting fat as well is just a side effect.  An hour later all three sat down around the dining room table Tom in much looser clothes than before seeing the food in front of Jack could understand why the two were getting fat there was a large plate of frues and steak covered in gravy a bowl of soup and  home made sundaes Jack managed to eat half of it before he started to feel full as he looked over both Tom and Dustin were still going eating until all their plates were clean and rubbing their bloated beiles <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better be off \"said Jack saying good by to his friends and leaving rubbing his own stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen next training day came </span></div></div>",

Jack could see that Tom had a new speedo, probably bought by Dustin to make sure that Tom had no embarrassing accidents when his old ones would burst due to his now slightly puffier form. He couldn't believe that both Tom and Dustin had been gaining weight and there seemed to be no alarm between the two of them, they both just seemed to be ignorant of their own and had casual opinions about their significant other's weight gain. But if this continued  it wouldn't be long till Tom's weight began to affect his performance, and Jack wasn't sure what was going to happen with Tom when that happened. But Jack soon pushed that thought out of his head, he was here to practice and sow his coach how he wasn't a lazy ass like Tom was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack slid on his speedo, but noticing some resistance it came up to his thighs. Jack was surprised it usually didn't get snug like this, maybe it had shrunk in the wash or something but he wasn't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"looks like someone's been porking out\" Tom teased, noticing his friend struggling to put on his speedo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gave him an annoyed glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What its the truth I'm afraid\" There was no hint of malice in Tom's voice as he said it. To him he was just playfully messing around with his friend and rival on the diving team. But to Jack this was personal after all he went ahead trying to encourage Tom to gain weight so Jack could finally get the spotlight on the team he deserved and everything seemed to be going into motion, and to have Tom declare that Jack was gaining weight, well it have Jack a twinge of annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right\" Most likely shrank in the wash, you know like yours\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom shrugged \"I dunno, you got a little belly poking out there Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack instinctively ran his hands on his midsection. He could feel his belly poking out and a tad of softness where it used to be . \"Damn it\" he thought to himself. \"Just how the hell did this....\" Then it hit him. He had been hanging out with Tom way too much. After all he had been making sure to Tom had been eating more rich and fattening food, and when Jack was with Tom he did eat a little more than he should, not to mention Dustin's cooking that he had last night. \"Well its hard to stay in top shape, when I'm always around you, you're like a black hole, you never stop eating sometimes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What no way\" Tom retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I saw that spread you and Dustin ate yesterday, if I continuing hanging out with the two of you I'm going to get fat I just know it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess you just don't train as hard as me\" Tom said getting cocky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was annoyed by the jab that Tom had hit him with, but then his irritation turned into deviousness, after all, he was going to enjoy fattening Tom. </span></div></div>",

The two of them then left the changing room idlily chatting as Jack had forgotten Tom poking fun of his weight gain when they were getting ready for practice. As they left the building Dustin was here yet again to pick up his lover Tom, The two of them briefly embraced each other before exchanging a pecks on each other's cheeks and smiling at each other as their eyes were locked on the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack spied that Dustin too had been gaining weight, it was no question since he was Tom's husband. Dustin's belly pooled in his lap, without a rigorous training exercise like he and Tom had, it was easier for Dustin to put on weight. Though Jack wasn't sure if was bigger than his lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, why don't we go out to a buffet today?\" Dustin suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?!' Tom said excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin smiled. \"Of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been sometime since Tom had been to a buffet given with his intensive training and strict diet, but he believed that one day at the buffet wouldn't hurt too much, after all, at least in his mind he had been doing a good job at keeping his figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin looked over to Jack, \"Would you like to join us, if you aren't too busy?\" Dustin asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\" Jack said, he was a little wary because he knew that he had been gaining weight and now he needed to watch what he ate but seeing Tom pig out was too good to turn down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin smiled. \"Excellent just follow me to the car then, as all three of them headed to the family car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them made there way to their seats, Tom and Dustin balancing all the food they had put on their plates. Jack was amazed just how much they had fit, and it was all fried stuff, crab rangoon, french fries, mozzarella sticks, chicken tenders, and more. Just looking at it all made Jack's stomach growly as he looked at his measly plate, in his effort to not gain anymore weight, but he felt out done by the two of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Jack that's all your eating?\" Tom asked as he sat down and took a bite of one of the chicken tenders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack raised his eyebrow annoyed with Tom saying how he had been teasing him about his weight gain earlier and now goading him into eating more. \"If I recall correctly, weren't you saying I was looking chubby not to long ago\" Jack retorted with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom chuckled, \"Oh come on, you're still on about that? I was just teasing, its just one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack rolled his eyes. \"Fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aren't trying to force you, we just want you to have a good time as well\" Dustin said after he swallowed the tender he was eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack appreciated how nice the two of them were being to him, maybe just for today he would let himself go, just this once, after all it was only one night.  Jack went back to the buffet table and loaded his tray up just how Dustin and Tom had and made his way back dug into his meal. The three of them ate without a care in the world.</span></div></div>",
