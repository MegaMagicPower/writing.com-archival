The first of the districts in Mythic City is called The Forest district. It is the district that is the most natural of the City and many creatures who prefer nature live in this district. Such As Fairies, Werewolves, Nymphs, Dryads and Elves. Of Course some Nature loving humans live here as well, but not much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The residential district is where the majority of humans live in Mythic City. however not every creature in the residential District is human. In fact dwarves, gnomes, and other creatures live here as well. Of course this isn't as great as the most busiest district of all. Fortunately for this district most homes are a fair price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The Business District is where most deals, hospitals and various business can be found of course much of the building here are built pretty well, and go up very high. Perfect place for Gargoyles, Griffons and others such as Vampires to live without having to worry too much. Then after that there is The Harbor where Mermaids and all sorts of water creatures reside. Now which district is your character going to be from. If you don't want to pick a district then there is the pre- made character options where you could look at pre-made characters and get on with the story.</span></div></div>",

Twenty years ago that would have been impossible, but in the world you live in today it is actually quite possible. You live in the residential district of the first city to mix creatures of mythology and Humans together.  You are thirteen years old and today is your first day of attending school that is not completely filled with fairies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  you look at your clock and it is time for you to get up and get ready for school, You are nervous about it, especially since it will be the first time you have ever been to a school. The past years you were training to use your fairy abilities, but now it is time for a whole different kind of experience. As you get up you stretch your arms, legs and wings out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You then brush your brown hair, put on a blouse and a skirt, then your socks and shoes. Once you are finished getting dressed you go out of your bedroom and then you fly onto your father arm and give it a bit of a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Good Morning Dad.\" you say. As you continue to hug your dads arm. At your current height you were only about six inches tall, but at least you had the power of flight to help get you around. Your dad however was about six feet and two inches tall. Compared to you he seemed to be quite big at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Good Morning Maggie, I see your still fairy sized, Not exactly sure how all that works, but breakfast is in the Kitchen.\" Your father said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" I know, but this is the first time I'm going to school with so many different people, Maybe it would be better if I just stayed with other fairies?\" You asked nervously uncertain of being around others, in fact it sort of made you feel small. Fortunately it was then that your mother came and interrupted your conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Maggie, we talked about this before, you need to meet other people aside from the ones your used to, Have some confidence I am pretty sure you will have a good time then, besides your part human too. So it is important for you to learn all aspects of your heritage and you wont always be around just fairies.\" Your mother said as she came and hugged her mother. Who was around the same height as she was at that time. Of course her mother was never really bigger then six inches tall. Often you even wondered how exactly  they were able to have you on an occasion due to their size difference, but every time you asked your parents just evaded the question.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     With your mother help You gained some confidence and after eating breakfast you  had changed form being six inches tall to  five feet and three inches tall. Thanks to their pep talk you were feeling better about going to school. Of course you were still nervous about whether or not you'd be bale to make any friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I never get used to that, every time I get bigger my clothes rip apart, why don't yours Maggie?\" Your father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" That's easy dad, they are enchanted clothing with magical properties, so all my stuff grows and shrinks whenever I change size, I already told you this several times before.\" You replied to your father's question. He then just simply nodded and then you went off to school. At the time you were sure it was going to be a great day, and perhaps even make some friends along the way. On the other hand it was all possible, your wing even grow when you get human sized. So there was no tell what the school day could  mean for you.</span></div></div>",

The good thing about that was it wouldn't be accidentally wrecked if you were human size. You then went and walked to school. Sure you could use your wings to fly if you chose to. But the city had a law that all people flying with their wings must get their Wing License first, normally for a fairy and when your six inches tall it doesn't matter. However when your human sized it matter quite a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Fortunately your school wasn't that far away and as you stood outside and looked at it you saw several other creatures enter the building as well. A minotaur, a Centaur, dwarf's, elves, werewolves and  even a few other fairies. Unfortunately none of which you knew. Still nervous about the whole new school thing you quickly entered and went to the auditorium. It was where all the student's were heading on their first day and where they would get their class assignments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Welcome to Mythic City High School, A school for all sorts of creatures, don't be shy this school will accommodate your needs. I know some of you might have rather unique needs, but don't worry will be sure to educate you as well. We've got quite a bit of history to cover.\" The speaker at the auditorium said. you didn't know who she was but from what you could tell she looked to be a Harpy.  You went and got your class schedule and when you looked you were relieved at some of the classes others you were a bit nervous about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Your first period class was History of the Fae. Or in other words History of the fairies it was something you were confident you could pass. Your second period Class was Algebra, you groaned at that as you didn't exactly like doing math. Then their was your Third period class. Mythical Creatures Flight Laws and Regulations. It was a basic class that reminds you of all the laws regarding flying in the city whether your six inches tall or bigger. Fourth period was your lunch break and then you had only three more classes to attend. Unfortunately they weren't exactly subjects you were comfortable in.  Physical Education or P.E. was right after lunch and your fifth period. As for Sixth period the class was something you had no idea if you would be any good at it. However you think a lot of people might be frightened off by a class called Ancient Linguistics. Then there was you final class of the day. This class was simply called English.  You weren't sure but something about that class just seemed to unnerve you. It wasn't a language class, yet it was one of the required classes for you to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As you were absorbed into your schedule you had the misfortune of accidentally bumping into someone, at the time you didn't see them. You then quickly went to apologize to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I'm sorry I didn't see you there.\" You said to him. As you looked up you saw that you had bumped into a Minotaur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" That will be twenty dollars.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I don't understand I said sorry, shouldn't that be enough?\"  you asked. But the Minotaur quickly and replied in an angry voice. you were scared and at the moment felt as if he were literally getting bigger each and every time you saw him. Then you quickly realize he wasn't getting bigger but you were slowly returning to your fairy size again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I said twenty dollars, you bumped into me and now your going to pay me or else!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You were now back to being six inches tall and the minotaur who was picking on you was looking bigger and scarier every moment you looked at him. You eventually give in and reach for your wallet and grab what money you had, unfortunately you didn't have twenty dollars and this was supposed to be your lunch money, but then what else could you have done?  As you then use your wings to fly up and give the Minotaur what little money you have...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shortly after that the Minotaur huffed in frustration and anger, then glared at the Human boy with an insidious smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" This isn't human affairs, She's going to pay me one way or another. And Nothing you can say will change my mind. So stay out of affairs, that aren't yours to begin with!\" The Minotaur yelled and made a loud roar.

Looking to go to an elite High school for the most prestigious of Vampire's. Of course someone as naturally gifted as me can only be destined for greatness. I have a mother and a father and they are very high upon the Vampire council if I do say so myself. Which of Course makes me even the better fit for the academy. Little did I know that my fate had other plans that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Greetings, common and ordinary youths, prepared to be dazzled as I am about to make my entrance to the most elite of vampire academies here in Mythic City.\" I said while talking in front of the mirror. Ordinary Mirrors and phones really can't capture the essence of a vampire. But enchanted Mirror's and phone's can literally capture my image for all of those common folks to see. It was during this time that my mother had entered the room with the letter for the most prestigious Vampire Academy in the city. I was so sure I passed the test, yet the look upon my mother's face was complicated at best. It was as if she knew something that would possibly upset me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Vlad, we got the letter from the Vampire Academy and...\" I interrupted my mother before she could finish speaking. She never like's when I do that but than again someone as magnificent as myself can get away with an interruption or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I am sure they found my to be the most magnificent specimen of a vampire  there is, and our begging to let me into their academy. Well I whole heartily accept them groveling at my feet.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You were not accepted Vlad!\" my mother told me flat out. Her way of speaking was direct and to the point. I was in awe at the time. After all how could an Elite Academy of Vampire's decline someone of my greatness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" How could they decline someone of my greatness? Surely I have proved myself to be worthy of their Academy?\" I asked my mother, to which she quickly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" You're not that great Vlad, and you haven't done anything for the Vampire's of the city. So far you have only been living in the shadow of me and your father's accomplishments. It's time you stop promoting yourself and learn to put others before you Vlad. A community needs to work together, and so far you just gloat about how great you are all the time. Yet haven't proved to be great at least according to their letter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Your saying I have yet to prove myself to be great? Or helped others. Nonsense I remember the test they gave and I made it through perfectly unharmed.\" I told my mother, but then she countered my argument of the reason of my nonacceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You made it unharmed, but that was only because of your teammates protecting you. When it came to endangering your team mates you used them as cannon fodder for all the traps in that test. Which is why you made it unharmed yet your unwilling to take any other blows for your team that you were assigned.\"  My mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" That is their reason, yet I see no reason I shouldn't have been accepted. It a shame though if only they had disliked me on one of my social media pages, I could dislike them too. But alas it was not meant for me to dislike them.\" I said while I was talking about that my mother groaned as if she was sort of annoyed at me. Yet she still had some more news for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Vlad you are going to Mythic City High School, it is a common high school, but I think it'll do you some good. I told you before  you need to learn to put others before yourself, and maybe going to this high school will help you with that.\" My mother told me, as for myself my reaction to the news of going to some commoner's school was well, Let's just say I was....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I demand that I be put in a private school with worth people of knowing my greatness.\"  I said.

I can tell you for sure that statement didn't go well for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" You Demand huh? Well that Settles it, your going to Mythic City High School. It's going to be public and your going to make friends. Is that understood Vlad.\" My mother said as she looked at me with an icy cold glare form my previous poor choice of words. I had completely doomed myself to the Mediocrity that would be known as Public Schooling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Know that I had to go to a public school and not a private school. It was then that my mind had an epiphany! I would become an elite amongst these common folk, someone they would worship and respect! These commoners of this High School would know greatness. Not just any greatness mind you, but the Greatness of me Vlad Bloodstone, the greatest Vampire ever!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  With a new attitude I began to imagine how I would gain and aid these folks to the point, where they would say. \" Vlad Bloodstone he's the greatest guy I ever met!

It was a long and hard journey for some the wounds had never healed and trust between humans was never going to happen again. That is until a mysterious incident got rid of the barrier that kept humans from discovering the locations of these creatures. No one was sure who or why such a barrier that was all over the planet Earth had been teared down, nor did they know of who.  However it meant that they could no longer hide from humans anymore and thus creatures of Myth, legend and supernatural were once again seen upon our world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   At first much friction still remained, however eventually the humans and creatures finally made a bold decision. They would build a city where all the races would live in harmony. Of course some were against such an idea and others sought it as a way to gather up all the creatures in one place so they could ignore them. While worst yet there were some groups who would still try to hunt these creatures of myth and legend down.  Which to many just proved how distrustful humans could be. Despite the arguments the city was built.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Twenty years later Mythic City stands at the pinnacle of inter species relations. While there are still some opposition. Most people who lived there  had grown used to and accustomed to the various city.  The cries of untrustworthy humans were slowly dampening as most Humans in the city.
