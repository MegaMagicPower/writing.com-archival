In a room surrounded by large, panel-shaped screens, he could view over 1/4 of the cameras on the island at once.

At this rate, the island could easily be cleared by the dawn of the first day. That wouldn't do... nobody would tune in to an Island with only animals!

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">\u201cHey there, everyone, this is Brien Beachcrown! This evening, as I join you from a helicopter above the beautiful Isle de Rapace, I\u2019m pioneering in reality TV shows with our hit-to-be, \u201cSurvivore\u201d! With me for this special pilot episode is none other than the CEO of the Uninspired Network, Samson N. Spired! He can be a little long winded, so if you\u2019re eager for action, just Tivo this segment and join us in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood evening to all of those watching at home. In precisely 35 minutes, when the sun sets on Isle de Rapace, the animals will be released and the games shall begin. In one month, we will have our winner, should one be left. Before  then, however, I\u2019d like to take a moment to explain just why we\u2019re breaking grounds today and setting a new standard for reality TV shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, \u201cSurvivore\u201d contains content that no other stations would touch with a thirty-nine foot pole. Their poles simply aren\u2019t as large as ours. We\u2019re the only network cutting-edge enough to show our viewers live footage of 492 former criminals of all sexes as they fight for freedom \u2013 and survival -  among the voracious wild animals (former pets charged with crimes and a hunger-inducing hormone)  on the island. It\u2019s going to be a brutal game, and it will only get tougher as the rules change later on. But at the same time, we\u2019re reaching out to a younger demographic as well \u2013 more on that in a moment-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-Excuse me sir, did you say this was live? How do we fit a live show into a thirty minute block??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHohoho! Brien, interjecting as if this wasn\u2019t all pre-scripted!\u201d I was just about to get to that, actually. For those of you who didn\u2019t hear the news at last month\u2019s conference, this is an event too big to be contained to one night a week. That\u2019s why Uninspired inc. is not just revolutionizing the content, but how you view it, too! You see, we\u2019ve bought out several hundred television channels, and each one of them will be streaming video, twenty-four seven, from countless cameras set up across the island. We even installed minicams inside the animal's stomachs (animal rights groups didn't like that...)! The channels are organized so that you can watch animal predators, human prey, or specific regions of the island. There are even a couple channels that contain edited, kid-friendly footage \u2013 we\u2019ve dubbed it \u201cSoftivore! THE SHOW DOESN\u2019T END JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY BECOMES A SNACK! \u2013 we\u2019ll just keep rolling, following the events of another animal, person, or place! Oh! And I almost forgot to talk about the scheduled competitions and Celebrity appearances! Every day-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-Sorry, boss, they\u2019ll have to figure it out later - after this commercial break!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis advertising segment could be yours! Simply contribute something (A chapter, points etc.) to The Uninspired Network (TUN) and your name, and a shout-out, could appear here! It doesn\u2019t even have to be related to Survivore! Apply now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019d like to join in on the fun of Survivore, all you need is an interweb connection! For no particular reason, people and creatures with a Writing.com account will be allowed to interject themselves into the game! For free! If danger isn\u2019t your thing, you can have your own helicopter/on-foot armed tour of the island! Simply go to the \u201cCustom Profile\u201d channel for details.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnemployment is higher than ever. If you\u2019re in need of money, we can help. Real money \u2013 not the dollar, not the Euro but the GP. Simply include your picture/link to your picture with your contribution and you can earn up to 1000 GP per illustrated chapter. In addition, you might get your drawing featured in this commercial, next time it airs! Can\u2019t draw? Just try, we aren\u2019t picky. Can\u2019t write, but want to draw? Pick a scene, draw about it, then E-mail the pic to have it edited into the scene!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c1 detailed review on your story:<br>\r\n500 GP<br>\r\n\u201c3 spam reviews on your story:<br>\r\n1,500 GP<br>\r\n\u201cGetting one chapter on your story for every chapter you contribute to Uninspired Inc?:<br>\r\nPriceless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now to our feature presentation (Cue annoying THX theme)!</td>",
