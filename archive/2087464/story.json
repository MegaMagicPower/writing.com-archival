It was an old book that was for certain but it looked sturdy enough upon inspection. When David looked at the cover he discover that the book must have once been wet because the front was peeling and unreadable. The book was large but David was still able to open it and hold it on his arm; the words at first glance were unreadable but they where unmarred by any damage. Focusing David knew that the letters where there to be read but his efforts where in vain as the book remained unreadable. Intrigued none the less David spoke with the Librarian and kept the book for himself when he left later in the day. <br>\r\nThe walk across campus was cold, there had not been any snow yet but most people thought it was only days away. Shivering beneath his jacket David hurried across the campus green to his dorm. Once inside the heat suffused him as he unlocked his room, it was his all 120 square feet of it. David considered himself lucky, he had heard stories of awful roommates and was glad he had escaped that potential problem. Setting the book down David once again strove to decipher the text which he could see but seemed unreadable, that was until it seemingly cleared and became understandable before Davids eye. Intrigued David immediately began reading. At first he thought it was a cooking book because all it seemed to contain was a set of instructions and ingredients list. But as he read on he realized that this was no book for cooking food it seemed to be for growing people. The book call the things body suits and David could only think of morph suits people wore for plays and Halloween. The more he read though he realized these where no innocent costume they where real wearable bodies, and the ingredients where not hard to get nor where the instructions hard to carry out. But  seemed that there where several different types of suits that could be created, each having a subtle difference to the other. One was just a skin that he could wear, he would retain his body shape but his skin would appear to be that of the persons skin as well as hair and facial features. Another one gave the wearer the body shape and appearance of the individual, a third one gave the wearer the body shape of the skin and helped the wearer \"move and speak\" like the skin. There were many others including one that was just a head and face. But which one would David choose?  </span></div></div>",

The only issue he currently did not have the limited supplies required nor did he know who he wanted to make a suit of. Finally David needed to get a DNA sample in order to make the suit take the form of that person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting the supplies had been easy enough, he had taken his car to the local box store and had bought all her needed for under 20 dollars but he now needed a source of DNA. The answer was easy enough when he saw his friends jacket; Danny was many would describe as having a classic surfer look despite the fact he had never surfed. He had shoulder length blonde hair was well muscled and was rumored to have a huge muscle between his legs. Inspecting the coat David quickly found a suitable length of hair and began to mix the materials together to make a skin. Once done the suit would have to grow overnight and that was how David left it, bubbling in the bucket it was mixed in as David fell asleep.     </span></div></div>",

Going to the bucket David was presented with what appeared to be a pile of skin with some blonde hair sticking out the top. Pulling it out and holding it up it appeared featureless with the exception of 7 holes around the hair. Looking at the book there was a not that all features would form after the skin was worn. Both excited and nervous David flipped the book closed ignoring the warning text printed at the very bottom of the page. Stripping what little clothing he had on David put one foot then the other through the suits mouth amazed by the flexibility. Wriggling and stretching David worked to get the suit in place on his body. Finally the skin sat comfortably on David and he looked to the mirror to see nothing but a featureless body shaped piece of flesh. Disappointed David turned to consult the book when he felt a wave of warmth and a very sudden set of new sensations. Turning back to the mirror David saw...<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://previews.123rf.com/images/goodluz/goodluz1301/goodluz130100208/17184129-Blond-woman-with-surprised-look-on-her-face-Stock-Photo-shocked.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://previews.123rf.com/images/goodluz...</a>     </span></div></div>",

Claire's eyes are still wide, or they David's, David really was not sure. He had wanted to be a guy on his first try but now that he was a girl he is actually pretty curious. The slight air current in his room in the very evident chill caused Claire's porcelain skin to pepper with goosebumps. It also caused Claire's nipples to become hard and send tingles arcing through the body. David let out a small feminine gasp from Claire's mouth as a sensation rebounded through him and ended between his legs. David knew enough about girls know exactly what he was feeling right now and quickly grabbed a blanket to cover up. This presented an interesting opportunity but he was very uncomfortable Claire skin, she being 4 inches shorter not to mention female, but he was still curious. He had intended to walk around campus as his friend just for the thrill of it but now he can do it as a hot blonde girl. Then again it might be best to take the skin off, after all this was his first try.</span></div></div>",

It did have some perks for the 20 year old college student, one it payed a decent wage and two it provided her with a constant set of new clothes to wear. The manager of the store had implemented the policy of one for one when it came to clothing going home with employees so long as the inventory number remained the same he did not care what the employees left of their own in exchange for some of the stuff that came in. That was exactly what Catherine was doing now going through one of the many drop offs that where made in bins around town. Most of the stuff was just tasteless tee-shirts and old jeans but one undeniable weird item came in. It was a body suit designed for a women that looked like it stretched from the neck to the ankles. Catherine was intrigued and pulled it out of the pile she was sorting through. After a brief inspection she took it to her locker and returned with a old pair of jeans in exchange eager to try on the suit after her shift. Returning to the table she began to sort through the clothing once more. </span></div></div>",
