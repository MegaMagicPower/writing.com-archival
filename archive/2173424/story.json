Fortunately, the Magical Clothing Emporium is just a few blocks away.  After turning the ignition, you exit onto Main Street and make your way down the few blocks.  As you approach the store, you see a massive parking lot brimming with cars exiting one at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" you exclaim.  \"Maybe I was too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find a spot close to the start of the store and take a brisk walk up to the entrance.  The now locally famous Brandy is holding the door open waving good bye to the last few patrons leaving the store to return home.  You live in a small town, but you don't seem to recognize any of the smiling faces strolling by.  You figure the store must have drawn in some customers from the county over.  You didn't want to admit to yourself, but you were nervously excited all day.  It's just a new clothing store.  Why was it giving you butterflies all day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the still waiving Brandy apprehensively and say, \"I know its a few minutes past, but do you mind if I can still look around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandy's smile suddenly drops, and she gives you an appraising look. \"Hmm, you do look a little disheveled.  Surely you can use my help!  I'll make an exception just for you today, but don't expect special treatment like this the next time you're late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a relived sigh.  You'll let the \"disheveled\" comment slide since she's letting you in after hours to look around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith renewed exuberant smile, Brandy proclaims, \"Welcome to my Magical Clothing Emporium!\"</span></div></div>",

Towering pristine marble pillars with Grecian reliefs of Gods and Goddess carved into the surface.  Black and white marbled floors accented by the occasional plush and colorful rug.  Aisles seem to reach out endlessly in all directions.  \"It must be a trick of the light,\" you think.  \"Surely the store is not this large\".  Your reverie is interrupted by a sharp metallic click of a locking mechanism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around sharply at the sound and see a sheepish looking Brandy returning some keys to her pocket.  \"Sorry!\" she offered demurely.  \"Just need to keep out more late looky-loos like you.\"  Her grinned returned and she asked, \"So...What do you want to look at first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining your composure, after being startled by the lock, you say \"Well, I came to get some of that new-lease-on-life stuff from your commercials, Or did you already sell out?\" You added a bit more cynicism and sarcasm into the comment than you intended, and you're sure Brandy must have picked up on that tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandy raised an eyebrow and the corners of her mouth turned into a mischievous smile.  \"At my Magical Clothing Emporium, it's all we stock.\"  Brandy briskly walks up and stares intently into your eyes for a few seconds.  The sudden intimacy makes you uncomfortable and you break eye contact first.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandy snaps her fingers. \"I've got just the ticket!\"  She grabs your hand and takes you to the aisles marked Gender.  \"An odd way to label a store,\" you think to your self.  This section of the store is a series of aisles, some marked Male and some marked Female.  Brandy shoots down an aisle marked Male still dragging you in tow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandy was a very attractive woman.  She had slightly tanned brown skin and a beautiful visage.  Her hair was dark brown, almost black and held in a professional tight single braid.  She was average height.  She wore a plain white button down blouse and a black skirt.  Simple, yet elegant.  The clothes were form fitting, and showed you Brandy had quite a curvaceous body.  You caught yourself peeking at her rear end as she whisked you away.  \"Stop being a perv, you thought to yourself, and quickly returned your eyes forward.  You were trying, but could not quite grasp her age.  On a first glance, she seems quite young to be a store owner.  Surely, she was not older than 21.  When you were looking into her eyes a moment ago, however, you got the sense her appearance belies her true age.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Brandy stopped part way into the aisle.  \"Here we go!\" Brandy said excitedly.  \"There is a wide variety here for you to choose from.  Why don't you find something nice and go try it on in the dressing rooms over there.\"  Brandy motioned outside the aisle entrance toward a big red velvet curtain obscuring and open doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter glancing at the dressing room, you start to look around at the options.  The racks are a mishmash of complete and partial outfits of all shapes, sizes, and a variety of styles.  You quickly notice, there are no clothing designed for men.  \"I think we're in the wrong place,\" you remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandy turned to face you and looked into your eyes again.  She wore the same pensive look she had the first time she gazed into your eyes. \"Nope.  I think we're exactly where you want to be,\" Brandy stated simply.  \"At my Magical Clothing Emporium, I can unlock your true potential!\" She stated while mimicking the tone and mannerisms of her commercials.  Brandy's tone took on a more serious quality. \"This is a very personalized consultation.  Trust that I know what is in your heart, and trust that I only want what is best for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood quite for a moment thinking to your self.  You have never told anyone about you heart's desires.  You often spend days dreaming of a different life.  You have spent days dreaming of fresh starts.  Most secretive in your heart, you have spent days dreaming of leaving you old male life behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole building is surreal.  From the moment you stepped inside, it feels like you have left the outside world behind.  None of this makes sense to your logical brain.  Surely what she is implying cannot be true. You think quietly to your self this meeting must be serendipity.  The universe is giving you a second chance.  The second chance  you've been dreaming about for so long.  Strengthen your resolve at that point.  You decide you will trust Brandy.  You sigh as you relax your defenses a bit.  \"I will trust you.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandy's exuberant smile returns.  \"Okay! Lets pick out the new you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of browsing, you pick off the rack....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided in that moment you would acquiesce to Brandy for this experience.  The doors to this otherworldly store were locked, and it was just you and Brandy.  Looking down the numerous aisles, you speculate Brandy could produce a copy of any garment in the world if you looked long enough.  There were many appealing options.  The racks were full end to end.  Some sections showed complete outfits with accessories.  Some sections held just a single piece of clothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding to your resolve to trust yourself to Brandy, you decide first on a set of matching white lace bra and panties.  You're unfamiliar with the female sizes listed on the tag, but they seem to be an appropriate size.  The cups of the bra seem large and have share a lovely floral pattern with the panties.  You face grows hot as you pull it off the rack.  Brandy smiles encouragingly.  \"A better selection was never made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that extra support, you head to the dressing rooms swinging past the red velvet curtain that obscures the open door and enter a long hallway.  The floor is covered with the same black and white marbled floor.  On either side of the hallway are closed white wooden doors.  Halfway down the hallway, you see one of the white doors is slightly ajar with a soft pink light coming from inside the room.  You approach the white doorway and push the door open.  You were expecting a dressing room, but instead found a large bedroom.  The room would easily take up the spacing of 3 or 4 of the doors.  \"Just more magic\" you suspect as you enter the room and shut the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of the room, there is a four post bed with white engraved posts on the sides.  The bed is covered with satin pink and lilac sheets.  There is also a white dressing table and a full length mirror in the room next to a closet full of clothes.  You place the matching bra and panties on top of the dressing table and take a deep breath.  The room smells sweet of raspberries and strawberries.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strip out of all your clothes setting them all inside a hamper in the lower half of the closet.  With slight hesitation, you pull the white lace panties up to your waist.  They hang off your waist like a poorly inflated balloon.  The hips and rear are too baggy.  Lastly, you take up the white lace bra sliding your arms through the straps.  You contort your arms behind you fumbling with the clasp for a moment before it latches.  The empty cups hang off your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand awkwardly in silence for a single moment when suddenly you start to feel a little dizzy and a little woozy.  You stumble your way to the satin bed and lie down on your back.  You feel completely relaxed and unable to move with any coordination.  A second strong wave of dizziness overtakes you at the same time your body starts to tingle.  Your body starts to tingle and feel warm and fuzzy.  Another moment passes and suddenly, you can feel your body is starting to change.  You feel your breasts are starting to grow. You can feel them getting rounder and bigger.  You can feel the weight of your breasts pushing you down.  Next you notice hips starting to grow wider and curvier and you can feel your waist going inward slightly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel tingly and warm and soft.  You love the feeling this is giving you.  Next you feel you thighs becoming more plump and shapely, and you calves becoming softer and shapely, and you feet becoming smaller and your hands becoming smaller and more elegant.  You can feel your arms becoming more elegant and you upper arms becoming rounder and more feminine.  Your hair is starting to grow, becoming soft and curly.  Your breasts are still getting bigger and bigger.  They are feeling so heavy on you and your nipples become sensitive as your nipples become erect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a tingling sensation between your legs. You move your hand down and you feel soft pubic hair, and a beautiful juicy pussy.  You run your hands up and down your thighs, your hips, your waist and your rounded tummy, and you feel so sensual and aroused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the wooziness and the tingling subside, you get out of the four post bed and walk over to the full length mirror, and you see yourself as a beautiful curvy women.  Big, voluptuous, and beautiful.  You move your hands over your breasts squeezing them gently which sends shivers of delight throughout your entire body.  You run your hands down your side into the curve of your waist and hips feeling your perfect hourglass figure and your round buttocks.  You are so beautiful and rounded and voluptuous.  So feminine and irresistible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reverie is interrupted by a tepid knock at the door.  Brandy is outside and she murmurs through the door \"Can I come in yet Darling?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute!\" You say.  You softly gasp at the sound of your girly voice.  It is foreign to your ears and is a surreal sensation to grasp the words you are articulating come out of a different voice. You walk to the door with a surprising amount of gracefulness you never possessed before.  You lay a hand on the doorknob pausing to look at your soft pristine skin and manicured shiny, clear nails.  With a newfound confidence, you swing the door open to see an expectant Brandy through the threshold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandy instantly yelps with excitement.  Her almond eyes are misty and she is wearing a effervescent smile.  \"Oh Darling!  You looks absolutely fabulous!  Glow up of the century.\"  You notice you are subconsciously returning her effervescent smile.  \"You may have noticed the closet full of clothes over there,\" Brandy said gesturing to the end of the room.  \"If you're happy with everything, you can go home with your new complete wardrobe today.  I guarantee everything will fit you  exquisitely.  So?  What will it be Darling?\" </span></div></div>",
